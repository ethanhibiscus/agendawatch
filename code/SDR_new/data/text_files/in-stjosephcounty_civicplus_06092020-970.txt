The Title VI Coordinator has made available at this meeting/hearing a voluntary Public Involvement Survey to collect 
demographic data to monitor and demonstrate St. Joseph Countyâ€™s compliance with its non-discrimination obligations 
under Title VI and Federal Regulation 23CFR 200.9(b)(4), and more importantly, ensure that affected communities 
and interested persons are provided equal access to public involvement. Compliance is voluntary. However, in order 
to demonstrate compliance with the federal regulation, the information requested must be documented when 
provided. It will not be used for any other purpose, except to show that those who are affected or have an interest in 
proceedings or the proposed project have been given an opportunity to provide input throughout the process.
