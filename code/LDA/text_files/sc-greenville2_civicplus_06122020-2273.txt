Briefing: The 2017-2022 ACOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) is a state-
mandated six year plan that lists all transportation projects in the COG’s planning 
area that utilize federal funding.  Federal regulations require that the TIP be updated 
every four years.  The update proposed by the Regional Transportation Advisory 
Committee changes the project programming window from 2017-2022 to 2021-
2027, which matches the programming window that SCDOT Commission will 
approve in June. Since this is an administrative change, no new projects or changes 
to existing projects are proposed at this time. Ms. Hall and Mr. Estep will present 
the recommendation from the Regional Transportation Advisory Committee for 
Board action.

accordance with an agreement between ACOG and SCDOT, the Board submits a 
ranking of projects in the region to SCDOT for funding consideration. Mr. Estep will 
present the recommended rankings from the Regional Transportation Advisory 
Committee for Board action.
