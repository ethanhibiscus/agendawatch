9. NEW BUSINESS 
 
a. Summer Fellow – Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee Chair Sharon Staz will introduce 
Aleksander Gulkewicz, a summer Fellow through a program sponsored by the University of New 
Hampshire.   
 
Alek is a 2020 graduate of Lehigh University, having majored in environmental engineering.  He is 
currently enrolled in a Master’s program at Lehigh where he is pursuing environmental policy. Alek has 
worked on research projects as diverse as renewable energy & sustainability for The GREEN Program in 
Reykjavik, Iceland, to interning for the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Studies in St. George's, Bermuda 
where he worked on an autonomous underwater glider project. Alek serves as the Youth Representative 
for the World Corrosion Organization to the United Nations. 
 
Alek began his work with Kennebunk on June 1st and will be working on a virtual basis through mid-
August.  Normally these Fellows are on site, living in the community and interacting on a daily basis with 
their mentor (in this case two members of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee) and meeting with 
staff and community residents.  Due to COVID-19, UNH has developed a virtual program designed to be 
productive and successful for all.  
 
Chairperson Staz will outline the work Alek will be performing as he assists the Town of Kennebunk this 
summer.  
 
b. Hear from the Economic Development Committee on the Advancement of a Small Business Micro-
Loan Program – The Economic Development Committee (EDC) has drafted the framework for a “Small 
Business Micro-Loan Program.” The Loan Program is designed to support small businesses with ongoing 
and extraordinary expenses incurred during the COVID-19 interruption in business. EDC Chair June 
Huston will present the details of proposed program. 
 
Please refer to supporting material – EDC Micro-Loan Program Proposal (PDF)   
 
MOTION:  To move this matter to a second reading on June 23rd. 
 
c. Discuss Dogs on Beach from June 15th to Labor Day – At a special meeting of the Select Board on 
June 3rd, the Board voted to require dogs on Kennebunk beaches to be leashed, eliminating the use of 
voice control as a form of managing a dog. 
 
Per the Town ordinance, beginning June 15th to Labor Day, dogs are only allowed on Town beaches 
before 9:00 a.m. and after 5:00 p.m. During this timeframe, dogs are allowed off leash and managed 
through voice control. Given the challenges of COVID-19 and the Center for Disease Control 
guidelines pertaining to social/physical distancing, the Board will discuss possible changes to the 
way dogs are to be managed while on the Town beaches beginning June 15th. 
 
MOTION:
