GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SPEAKERS: 
Planning Board members are volunteers appointed by the Mayor to serve seven-year 
terms.  Each member has a single vote and a quorum (4 or more members) is 
required to vote on an application. 
• All meetings are video recorded and webcast; please provide public input in a 
respectful manner. 
• Public input will occur after the Applicant has presented the project to the 
Planning Board. 
• Speak clearly into the microphone and state your name and address. 
• Speakers will be timed – two (2) minute limit for public comment and three (3) 
minute limit for public hearing.  Be concise, it’s OK to speak for less than the 
time limit. 
• Individuals may not donate their allotted time to other speakers. 
• Face the Planning Board at all times, do not engage in direct discussions with the 
audience. 
• Do not repeat points made by previous speakers. 
• No laughing, heckling, speaking or clapping from the audience. 
• Comments to the Board should specifically relate to the application under 
consideration and be directly relevant to the evaluation criteria.
