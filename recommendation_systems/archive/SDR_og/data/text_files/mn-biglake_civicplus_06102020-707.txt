4A.  
Small Cell Aesthetic Guidelines Discussion 
 
Hanna Klimmek discussed the Small Cell Wireless Facility Aesthetic Requirements that were 
approved by Council in April 2019. The City’s intention was to protect the look and location of 
Small Cell installations within public rights-of-way. Klimmek noted that with evolving technology 
and the new 5G network, it is anticipated that an increase in small cell facilities will be installed 
throughout the City in the coming years. Staff is asking for continued discussion on whether 
Council feels that adopting additional standards will be beneficial for the City. Klimmek reviewed 
additional design requirements that could be added to our current standards. Klimmek also 
informed Council that the first small cell application was submitted to the City for review in April. 
The equipment will be located on school property, out of the public right-of-way. That application 
will not have to adhere to any design requirements adopted after their submission, only what is 
existing at time of application. Klimmek reviewed sample design standards adopted by other 
municipalities and asked for feedback from Council. 
 
Council Member Knier stated that he is in favor of implementing aesthetics standards, but he is 
more concerned about limiting this technology for the safety of our community, and safety of our 
families. Knier stressed that there hasn’t been one scientific study that shows how 5G will affect 
the human body, especially in children. This product was fast tracked and is highly suspect. The 
burden of proof should be on the technology companies. Knier stated his concern with Electro 
Smog hitting us 24/7 once this all implemented. Knier clarified that he understands that, we as a 
City are just talking about aesthetics, but stated that there are other alternatives to 5G for faster

downloads. Knier stressed that he would like us to use an abundance of caution on 5G, and 
would like to make our aesthetic guidelines as stringent as possible, would like to restrict 
allowing 5G in front of residential structures, and would like the City to consider implementing a 
moratorium.  
 
Mayor Wallen clarified that we need to focus on aesthetics only, as that is what is under our 
control. Wallen also stated that he prefers we allow blending in of the equipment instead of 
attempting to cover it. 
 
Council Member Hansen discussed his concerns with the cost impact the City could face if we 
try to take on the telecommunications industry to fight implementation of 5G. We could also take 
a chance on limiting placement in front of residences as some citizens could potentially want 5G 
service. Hansen stressed that we need to implement additional aesthetic measures so these 
areas will look nice.  
 
Council Member Johnson stated that our aesthetic rules would be in addition to what the utility 
companies already require. Layne Otteson discussed the large amount of small cell technology 
around the U.S. Bank Stadium area noting that it blends in well with the infrastructure. Council 
Member Johnson stressed that from a legal perspective, the City does not have the authority to 
stop 5G. The only way to change the policy, is to change the FCC. This legislation was 
completely pre-empted by the FCC and we should make the aesthetics guidelines as robust as 
we can with straight and clear guidelines.  
 
Council Member Zettervall discussed that he prefers the fully concealed designs, and possibly 
matching if at a higher elevation. Zettervall also stated that he feels local government shouldn’t 
be responsible for fighting to restrict 5G and this should be turned over to higher level agencies. 
Otteson discussed that each location is an investment of approximately $150,000 so they will 
build it right, with the right rules in place. 
 
Council directed Staff to move forward with drafting additional small cell aesthetic guidelines into 
Chapter 10, Section 1022 and Chapter 14 for future Council review. 
 
4B. 
Lakeside Park Food Truck Discussion 
 
Corrie Scott discussed the current process for approving permitting food trucks to exclusively 
operate at Lakeside Park. Originally the minimum bid amount was $3,000 but was reduced to 
$1,000 in 2018 due to lack in interest from food truck vendors. Scott reviewed other options 
available including 1) changing from a minimum bid amount to a daily profit percentage, 2) 
lowering the base fee to entice vendors to apply for a permit, and 3) the option to use the regular 
food truck fee schedule along with an additional charge of $20 per day and $20 if they request 
electric hookups. Staff recommended Option 3 as this option would help cover administrative 
costs toward this program. This would be done through an application process and could 
potentially include a stipulation that the food truck vendor live within a certain mile radius to Big 
Lake. Staff also recommended that for 2020, this program begins in July and runs through 
August with food trucks having the ability to set up on Fridays and Saturdays and with priority

given to local food trucks. For future years, the program can be updated to become more 
streamlined and potentially include the months of June through August.  
 
Council member Zettervall discussed his concern that Food Trucks compete with our brick and 
mortar companies. Enabling food trucks could be at the expense of tax paying businesses and 
would like to leave our current policy in place. Zettervall also suggested that we consider 
restrictions on loud generator use at the lake. 
 
Council Member Johnson discussed the same concerns shared by Council Member Zettervall. 
Our brick and mortar businesses are really struggling with COVID-19 restrictions. There is a lot 
of activity at the lake and part of the benefits of having this recreational option in our community 
is that those that come into town for this amenity, provide additional business to our local 
establishments. 
 
Scott noted that Staff understands there could be benefits to waiting to implement any changes 
to the program until next year due to COVID-19 concerns, and agreed that it would be beneficial 
to restrict the use of loud generators at the lake. 
 
Mayor Wallen stated that he likes option 3 as he has witnessed the need for food vendors out at 
the lake. Suggested we treat this as a trial year and Staff will monitor. 
 
The general consensus of the Council was to implement option C for July and August 2020 and 
report back to Council on how the program worked.  
 
4C.  
AIS Inspection Update 
 
Layne Otteson discussed Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) inspections that will be taking place at 
Lakeside Park this summer. The City, the Big Lake Community Lakes Association (BLCLA), and 
the Sherburne Soil and Water Conservation District (SSWCD) planned to provide 350 hours of 
on-site inspection using a combination of Level 1 inspectors and volunteers. This plan would 
have provided coverage on weekends and holidays during the summer months. The City and the 
BLCLA have both dedicated 100 volunteer hours each, and the SSWCD has dedicated 150 
Level 1 inspectors. The BLCLA has asked the City to provide an additional 400 hours of summer 
inspection. These additional hours would essentially cover the hours between 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 
p.m., during weekdays. The estimated cost to do this would range from $6,000 to $7,600. 
Otteson noted that availability of personnel to perform this work may be challenging due to DNR 
limitations is likely not viable. Otteson explained that the DNR is only re-certifying Level 1 
inspectors for companies such as WaterGuards through teleconferencing. There are no 2019 
volunteer inspectors that are being reapproved at this time and the DNR has not indicated when 
or if they will provide training for past or new volunteers. There is also a concern that getting 
volunteer inspectors from the BLCLA may be problematic this year due to health concerns. With 
COVID-19 causing planning issues, Staff requested that SSWCD use their dedicated 150 
inspection hours in Big Lake over the Memorial Day weekend and during the month of June. 
They have indicated that they prefer to spread their hours over the summer months. This will 
serve as a buffer through June and allow Staff to better understand the DNR’s response and

boat launch usage. Otteson discussed budgeted dollars that are available to use part-time 
seasonal employees at Lakeside Park to monitor parking and perform the facility survey through 
June 10th. This would be utilized when the SSWCD is not providing AIS inspections. Otteson 
noted that Staff believes that by June 10th, the DNR may make a decision regarding the training 
of volunteer level inspectors. Otteson reviewed four viable options for addressing AIS inspection 
needs. Staff recommended Option C which includes utilizing 150 hours of seasonal employees 
to provide full time coverage at peak times which would be 42 hours per week estimated at a 
cost of $6,000 which would also utilize the remaining Michelob Grant dollars. This staff would be 
wearing high visibility vests and would perform a short facility survey of boat launchers. This 
information would be valuable in identifying improvements and raising the level of service at the 
park. Staff recommended Council direct staff to bring back a plan that identifies hiring additional 
part-time seasonal staff, inspection levels, cost, and funding sources. 
 
Council Members Hansen, Knier, and Zettervall stated they are in favor of Option C, noting that 
there are no dollars out of the budget. 
 
Council Member Johnson discussed that it is extremely important that we have coverage at the 
landing. Johnson indicated that Option C would be the minimum coverage she would be in favor 
of, and wishes the DNR would resume trainings and certifications. 
 
Mayor Wallen stated that he is in favor of option C, noting that we need to continue discussing 
future AIS needs during budget discussion time. 
 
Council directed Staff to bring back a plan that identifies staffing needs, inspection levels, cost, 
and funding sources for future Council consideration. 
 
4D.  
New Ideas Discussion 
 
Council Member Knier discussed that he has taken feedback from citizens that the audio is not 
picking up sound very well during workshops and meetings with how the room is set up in 
response to COVID-19. Gina Wolbeck informed Council that the Sherburne Wright Cable 
Commission installed a new microphone just before the start of the workshop so the audio 
recordings should be greatly improved with the new equipment.

PUBLIC HEARING – Sandhill Villa’s Easement Vacation and Development 
Application for Rezoning, Final Plat, and Final PUD Approval 
 
Kevin Shay reviewed the planners report for the Development Application for Final Plat, 
Final PUD and Easement Vacation for the Sandhill Villas project submitted by Modern 
Construction of Minnesota. The application is for a 12-unit detached townhome 
development on 2.5 acres of vacant land located at the intersection of 205th Avenue NW 
and 172nd Street NW. The Planning Commission and City Council approved Preliminary 
Plat, Development Stage PUD, and Rezoning in April 2020 and conditions identified at 
these meetings have been met. Shay noted that the final site plan is substantially 
consistent with the approved preliminary site plan and revisions required have been met by 
the Applicant. Shay discussed the Easement Vacation that is required as part of the Plat. 
The site was originally platted as part of the Sandhill Acres plat and was platted with a 
drainage and utility easement around the perimeter of the lot. The Applicant is required to 
vacate this easement as part of platting “Sandhill Villas”, and new drainage and utility 
easements will be put in place with the new final plat. Shay noted that a public hearing is 
required to be held to take public comment specifically on the vacation of the easement.

Council Member Knier asked if drainage concerns have been addressed. Shay indicated 
that the Applicant is working through final comments from the engineering memo to make 
final adjustments to the drainage, and that these changes will address the drainage 
concerns raised previously.  
 
Mayor Wallen opened the public hearing at 6:11 p.m.  
 
Jon Tschida, 17267 205th Avenue – indicated that he owns the property to the west of the 
project. Tschida stressed that his interpretation of the City Code is that it allows for PUD 
approval only if the plan meets a majority of 13 criteria, of which this project only meets 4. 
Tschida also stated that a PUD should not be granted based solely on making profits for 
the landowner. Tschida stressed that the proposed project does not fit the location, noting 
that this development will be a small pocket of high-density residential development sitting 
in the middle of low density residential development. Tschida discussed aesthetic concerns 
asking where the buffer is along his property line, and how will the impact on his property 
be mitigated. Tschida asked that drainage issues be addressed, stressed that setbacks are 
an issue, and noted that future development will call for a turn lane or a roundabout.  
 
Dan and Janette Moores, 17369 205th Avenue – Dan Moores stated that they are 40-year 
residents of the land west of Tschida’s and noted that they purchased an additional 5 acres 
in anticipation of selling it in the future when they retire. They made this purchase under 
the assumption that the surrounding lots would have single-family homes built on them in 
the future. Moores stated that by allowing spot zoning in this location for this townhome 
villas project will wreck their nice quiet neighborhood. Moores stated that they are 100% 
opposed to this project. 
 
Samantha Tschida, 17267 205th Avenue, submitted written comments that were read aloud 
– the letter stated her opposition to the project, noting that it is not feasible for 12 homes to 
fit on a 2.5-acre parcel of land. Tschida’s letter also indicated that she feels the project 
does not meet setback requirements, that snow removal will be a concern, that water 
drainage has not been addressed, and that landscaping requirements aren’t being met. 
 
Mayor Wallen closed the public hearing at 6:22 p.m. 
 
Mayor Wallen asked for a motion and a second to approve all items as presented. Council 
Member Zettervall motioned to approve, and Council Member Hansen seconded. Mayor 
Wallen opened the floor for further Council discussion prior to vote. 
 
Council Member Johnson asked how our Planning Commission responded to the assertion 
that only 4 criteria were met. Council Member Zettervall reviewed Planning Commission 
and Staff discussions on the design criteria of PUD approval, noting the code lists a 
number of purposes which is a list of reasons why a project would qualify for a PUD, and 
Big Lake City Council Meeting Minutes 
Date: May 27, 2020 
 
Page 4 of 13 
 
stated that the design criteria for the proposed project are met, and does meet the 
definition of the PUD. Zettervall also reviewed various discussion points that occurred at 
Planning Commission. The density for profit was questioned and it was noted that 
Townhomes and Villas are required to go through a PUD process due to the nature of the 
development. Discussion was also held on density and requirements of the 
Comprehensive Plan. During their initial review, the Planning Commission had discussed 
possibly scaling the project back to 8 units, but that was never an implemented 
requirement. Zettervall also indicated that the City Engineer did not have an issue with 
setbacks in relation to the possible need for a turn-lane and stormwater plans. Zettervall 
also discussed the landscaping with flexibility to allow one tree in the front yard and one 
tree in the back yard, instead of two trees in the front yard. Layne Otteson reviewed that 
Engineering had asked for additional drainage improvements on the west side which have 
been incorporated into the plan on the west, north and east side of the development. 
Engineering had also asked for an adjustment to the street width along 172nd Street, and 
Otteson noted that snow removal has also been addressed.  
 
Council Member Hansen stated that he feels concerns were addressed at the Planning 
Commission level. Council Member Zettervall indicated that they had a number of 
conditions that were brought forward by the Planning Commission, and that those 
conditions appear to have been met. 
 
Council Member Knier discussed the proposed setback along 205th Avenue and asked for 
law enforcement to comment on the setback. Joel Scharf stated that from a law 
enforcement perspective, he is comfortable with the setback. 
 
With no further discussion, Mayor Wallen asked for a vote on the motions on the table. 
 
Council Member Zettervall motioned to approve Resolution No. 2020-46 approving an 
Easement Vacation for the Sandhill Villas project. Seconded by Council Member Hansen, 
unanimous ayes, motion carried.

 CommonBond Development Application – Concept Plan Review 
 
Hanna Klimmek reviewed the planners report for the CommonBond Development 
Application. The Applicant, CommonBond Communities has submitted a Concept Plan, 
requesting City review and comment for the proposed 120-unit mixed income project. The 
project will consist of two (2) 60-unit apartment buildings and is proposed to be constructed 
in two phases on a 7.49-acre parcel at the northwest corner of Marketplace Drive and 168th 
Street. Following concept review, the next step in the application process would be to apply 
for a Planned Unit Development (PUD), Preliminary Plat, Rezone, and Site Plan. The 
Applicant has communicated with Staff that the Concept Plan is preliminary in terms of 
timing of the development, and that the project is applying for subsidized tax credits 
through the Minnesota Housing Tax Credit Program due to the mixed-income aspect of the 
development. If awarded, the Applicant plans to submit development applications to the 
City in December 2020. Klimmek reviewed the original concept plan submitted by the 
Applicant and reviewed by the Planning Commission on April 1, 2020. The Commission did 
not support the location of the project due to the guided use of Commercial. The request 
was planned to be reviewed by the City Council on April 22, 2020 but the Applicant 
withdrew their application. The Applicant is now proposing to locate their project on a 
parcel that is currently guided in the City’s Comprehensive Plan as Medium and High 
Density Residential use. The Concept Plan was reviewed by the Planning Commission on 
May 20, 2020 which in general, supported the new location of the apartment project due to 
the guided use of the property and they felt the site plan was satisfactory. Klimmek 
discussed that the current zoning of the property is General Business (B-3) and the 
Applicant will be required to rezone the parcel to match the Comprehensive Plan to High 
Density Residential (R-3). Currently the subject property is an Outlot of the Big Lake 
Marketplace North addition. The developer is proposing to plat the property into two (2) 
parcels. The west 60-unit apartment complex would be constructed as Phase I, and the 
east 60-unit apartment complex would be constructed as Phase II. The current plan 
reflects the apartments being constructed in 3-stories. The units will mostly consist of 60% 
Area Median Income, with some market rate units. Roughly 50% of the units will be two-
bedroom, with the remaining units split between one-bedroom and three-bedroom units. 
The Applicant indicated that the units will have high-end amenities and on-site 
management. Klimmek reviewed PUD flexibility which will include reduced parking, lack of

a loading area, and lot coverage standards.  
 
Council Member Zettervall reviewed discussions at the Planning Commission relating to no 
covered parking, and noted that the developer presented their original plan on a different 
location, but due to comments from the Planning Commission, they have moved to a 
different site. Zettervall stated that the new site received unanimous support of the 
Planning Commission.  
 
Council Member Johnson stated that she is a little concerned about limited parking and 
asked the developer to provide feedback on their parking calculations. Andy Hughes 
reviewed their parking calculations and stated that they do believe the proposed parking 
plan will provide an appropriate level of parking and reviewed a recent project they 
completed that has the same level of parking calculations. They will continue to monitor 
parking needs and if Council wishes, they would be willing to add a couple more spots in 
between the two buildings to provide additional guest parking. 
 
Zettervall noted that parking was discussed during meetings of the Comprehensive Plan 
Taskforce, noting that the Comprehensive Plan now guides toward giving developers more 
flexibility on parking based on their needs. 
 
7C. 
CommonBond – Resolution of Support 
 
Hanna Klimmek reviewed the CommonBond multifamily housing project located on the 
north side of US Highway 10 in the Marketplace North area. The project will be named 
Marketplace Crossing I and II and will consist of 120-units of both market rate and 
affordable rental units. The 120-units will be made up of two 60-unit buildings and will have 
amenities such as shared walking paths, stormwater features, and playgrounds. The two 
units will be constructed in two phases, and CommonBond is asking for a Resolution of 
Support for Phase I at this time. Klimmek noted that Staff is in support of the project along 
with the Planned Unit Development (PUD) flexibility the Applicant is requesting. 
CommonBond will be submitting a tax credit application to Minnesota Housing this year, 
and if awarded will begin Phase I construction in 2021. Klimmek also noted that the 
Applicant is not asking for any local incentives other than flexibility through a PUD. 
Klimmek discussed the May 11, 2020 Big Lake Economic Development Authority (BLEDA) 
meeting where the BLEDA unanimously recommended Council approval of the Resolution 
of Support. 
 
Council Member Johnson motioned to approve Resolution No. 2020-49 in Support for 
CommonBond to submit a tax credit application to Minnesota Housing to newly construct 
60 units of both market rate and affordable rental options. Seconded by Council Member 
Hansen, unanimous ayes, motion carried.

Great River Federal Credit Union Development Application – Rezoning, 
Preliminary Plat, and Site Plan Review 
 
Hanna Klimmek reviewed the planners report for the development application submitted by 
Vanman Architects & Builders for the proposed Great River Federal Credit Union project. 
The application consists of a Preliminary Plat, a Rezone from Agriculture (Ag) to General 
Business (B-3), and site plan review for the development of a vacant parcel located south 
of US Highway 10 and east of County Road 43. The Applicant is proposing to plat the 
property into one parcel to be known as Lot 1, Block 1, Great River Addition. The site will 
consist of one office building with two access points off 198th Avenue. Klimmek reviewed 
that Staff has negotiated with the Applicant that the required sidewalk for the property 
should be altered to extend from the development to the intersection of 198th Avenue/CR 
43 rather than installing the sidewalk adjacent to the property with no connection to the 
intersection. The subject site is a 2.13-acre parcel that is currently guided as Commercial in 
the City’s Comprehensive Plan. The parcel was annexed by the City in September 2019, 
and at that time was given an automatic zoning designation of Agriculture (Ag). The 
rezoning of the site to General Business (B-3) is consistent with surrounding districts and 
the Comprehensive Plan. Klimmek reviewed general site information, lot coverage and 
surface water, parking and site circulation, building materials, and landscaping 
requirements. Klimmek noted that the Planning Commission held a public hearing on May 
6, 2020 and no public comment was submitted. The Planning Commission unanimously 
recommended approval of the application. 
 
Council Member Knier motioned to approve Ordinance No. 2020-13 to rezone parcel no. 
10-120-3400 from Agriculture (Ag) to General Business (B-3). Seconded by Council 
Member Hansen, unanimous ayes, motion carried. 
 
Council Member Knier motioned to approve Resolution No. 2020-50 approving the Great 
River Preliminary Plat and Site Plan Review. Seconded by Council Member Hansen, 
unanimous ayes, motion carried. 
 
Council Member Knier motioned to approve Resolution No. 2020-51 authorizing summary 
publication of Ordinance No. 2020-13. Seconded by Council Member Hansen, unanimous 
ayes, motion carried.

Big Lake Car Condo’s Phase I Request – First Amendment to Development  
 
Contract 
 
Clay Wilfahrt presented a request from Richard Hinrichs for the return of escrow dollars the 
City is holding for the Big Lake Car Condo’s Phase I project. The developer is currently 
waiting to proceed with the project during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, 
Hinrichs has asked if the City can return his escrow money until he decides to continue

Date: May 27, 2020

development. Wilfahrt explained that part of the escrow is held to pay for legal, 
engineering, and planning services. The other portion is held for landscaping. Since no 
construction or landscaping has commenced, Staff is comfortable returning the escrow as 
long as the developer executes a First Amendment to the Development Agreement 
between the City and Richard Hinrichs that was drafted by the City Attorney. The amount 
that would be returned to the developer would be less any expenses already incurred by 
the City. Deb Wegeleben noted that we will retain some of the escrow dollars to pay all 
outstanding payments.  
 
Council Member Johnson motioned to approve a First Amendment to the Development 
Agreement between the City of Big Lake and Richard Hinrichs. Seconded by Council 
Member Knier, unanimous ayes, motion carried. 
 
7F. 
Reject Bids for the 2020 Street and Utility Improvement Project No. ST2020-1 
 
Layne Otteson reviewed bids that were publicly opened on April 7, 2020 for the 2020 Street 
and Utility Improvement Project ST2020-1. The low bid was submitted by Minnesota 
Paving and Materials of St. Cloud, MN. Otteson also reviewed several discussions Staff 
and Council have had since the bid opening noting shared concerns regarding project cost 
impacts to the City and residents during these uncertain financial times. The general 
consensus was to delay the award decision and continue monitoring the economic impacts 
of COVID-19, and prepare to address immediate 2020 needs. Staff was directed to bring 
back an update and recommendation within the 60-day window allowance to award after 
opening the bids. Otteson reviewed resident comments on how they would like the City to 
proceed with the project which included three that want the project to move forward this 
year, a couple comments were indifferent, and six residents that would prefer to wait for a 
year to complete the project. The consensus of those commenting was that they want the 
project to happen, and if it isn’t completed this year, they would like to fix bad areas such 
as potholes and flooding issues. Concerns with State funding in the coming year was also 
discussed, and the type of road construction the City is planning to construct. Otteson 
reviewed the potential cost risk in delaying the project, and reviewed the Preliminary 
Engineering Report that was ordered by Council at the last meeting that will most likely 
include repairs to the CR 81 water main break, addressing issues at Euclid and Leighton, 
water service insulation repairs on Mount Curve, and ADA pedestrian ramp upgrades. 
Otteson noted that Staff is recommending Council reject all bids due to the uncertain 
economic times which may burden the City and residents, and for Council to direct Staff to 
revise the scope and schedule for future consideration.  
 
Council Member Johnson discussed that there are numerous streets throughout the City 
that are in very poor condition, noting that the areas included in the 2020 street project are 
abysmal, and stated her concern that project costs are not going to get cheaper. Johnson 
stated that she understands the vulnerability of the bond market and the sensitivity of our

economy, but noted that she is concerned that if the City piece meals the project, it will add 
to the cost of the overall project. Johnson stated that she doesn’t want to scale the project 
back, and feels the project as a whole is a good project. COVID-19 is a temporary problem, 
while the street project would be a 25 to 30 year project that could be derailed. Johnson 
stated that we would just be stacking up the problem. 
 
Council Member Hansen stated that the consensus of the residents is that they want the 
project done, noting that the Powell Street area is terrible, especially by the park area. 
Hansen stated that he is sensitive to economic conditions with COVID-19, but stressed that 
he is not in favor of carrying assessments for a year. He would rather rebid or take the low 
bid, and is in favor of doing the project this year.  
 
Council Member Zettervall stated that while he really wants to move forward with the 
project, he is not sure if it’s the most fiscally responsible thing to do with the economic 
downturn. Zettervall stated that he feels we will be back on track financially by 2022. 
Zettervall also discussed the extremely poor condition of the Leighton Drive/Euclid Avenue 
street area.  
 
Council Member Knier stated that while he would like to move forward with the project, he 
recognizes that economic times are too uncertain for both the City and its citizens. Knier 
discussed that he would prefer to reject the bids, rebid at a later date, and put the project 
off at least one year. 
 
Mayor Wallen discussed that we don’t have a clue what the economic impact will be and 
how that will affect the City’s finances as well as residents. We know the project needs to 
be done, but stated that he isn’t comfortable going $3,000,000 into debt at this time. 
Wallen suggested scaling the project down to only vital improvements for this year, and 
using cash instead of debt. Wallen stated that he prefers to reject all bids now and bring 
back in 2021. 
 
Council Member Knier motioned to receive bids and reject all bids for the 2020 Street and 
Utility Project No ST2020-1 and direct Staff to reevaluate options. Seconded by Council 
Member Zettervall, motion passed with a vote of 3 to 2 with Mayor Wallen and Council 
Members Knier and Zettervall voting aye, and Council Members Hansen and Johnson 
voting nay. Motion carried.

Resolution Authorizing Temporary Capacity Expansion for Big Lake Bars and  
 
Restaurants 
 
Clay Wilfahrt reviewed Governor Walz’ most current Executive Order for bars and 
restaurants to begin to re-open and the limitations that have been put into place. It is Staff’s 
understanding that outdoor dining, along with the rules that must be followed, will be very 
burdensome to Big Lake bars and restaurants. Staff has discussed this issue with local 
establishments and the owners are extremely concerned that they don’t have the proper 
accommodations for the limitations set forth by the Governor, and that the City’s zoning 
rules could prohibit them from opening in an outdoor setting. The City is being asked to 
allow bars/restaurants to expand their capacity into adjoining areas, such as into their own 
property or into their parking lot areas. Wilfahrt reviewed discussions during statewide 
conference calls with the MCPA and the MSA relating to the physical expansion of the 
establishments and how that affects liquor licensing. Statutes regulate that the licensed 
premise can include physically connected attachments to the main structure such as 
patios, decks, or pavilions. The space would have to be owned and/or leased by the 
licensee and be part of the business. The City would have to approve any compact and 
contiguous additions to the licensed premises and include such additions in the license 
files and on documentation defining the licensed premises. Wilfahrt clarified that local 
zoning and building codes would apply. Staff recommended that Council consider offering 
Big Lake bars and restaurants a temporary solution to provide relief with the most recent 
restrictions that have been placed upon these types of businesses. Staff is prepared to 
work with establishments to allow them to serve food, beverages, and alcohol on an 
expanded portion of their premises provided they comply with state and local laws. Wilfahrt 
presented a draft resolution prepared by the City Attorney that would temporarily permit 
outdoor customer service areas and outdoor liquor sales through December 31, 2020 in 
response to COVID-19 State of Minnesota limitations placed on bars and restaurants. The 
resolution also requires that affected businesses provide a liquor insurance certificate that 
indicates the expanded capacity is covered by their insurance. 
 
Mayor Wallen asked for a motion and a second to approve the resolution as presented. 
Council Member Knier motioned to approve, and Council Member Johnson seconded. 
Mayor Wallen opened the floor for further discussion prior to vote. 
 
Jeff Zierdt, owner of Lupulin Brewing clarified that they are considered a brewery, not a bar 
or restaurant, but that the State directive was to include breweries in the June 1st reopening 
of bars and restaurants. Zierdt commented how important it is for communities to work with 
their businesses to accommodate outside sales and service, noting that we all need to 
work together to figure out how to make this work. Issues will need to be addressed 
regarding staffing, reservations, and inclement weather concerns that the establishments 
will need to work through. Zierdt informed Council that Lupulin Brewing has plans to reopen 
on Friday, June 5th.

Monthly Department Reports 
 
Deb Wegeleben provided a year-to-date financial report, discussed the unassigned fund 
balance and reviewed allocated funds identified in the City’s Capital Improvement Plan 
(CIP) Fund. Wegeleben also discussed that allocated items from the CIP Funds for 2020 
that a contract has not been entered into have been placed on hold until further notice, and 
informed Council that the 2020 Local Government Aid pending amount is $720,974. 
Council Member Johnson discussed her surprise that tax collections are on track. 
Wegeleben stated that most likely a lot of businesses had already paid their first half 
property tax before COVID-19, noting that we may see a decline in tax payments when the 
second half comes due in October. 
 
Greg Zurbey provided an update on the Municipal Liquor Store operations for April 2020. 
Zurbey noted that the store was closed on Easter Sunday, and reviewed a year to date 
financial comparison between 2019 and 2020. 
 
Hanna Klimmek provided an update on activities in the Community Development 
Department. Klimmek reviewed housing/commercial development statistics/projects, and 
redevelopment projects. Klimmek also reviewed a year to date 2019/2020 permit activity 
comparison, provided a status update on the Community Branding and Identity Design 
project, and noted that Staff continues to support the Big Lake business community by 
advertising for them and providing updates on relief loans as well as pertinent information 
they need to be aware of.

ACTION REQUESTED 
By approving this item on Consent Agenda, Council would be approving not waiving the monetary limits 
on municipal tort liability established by Minnesota Statutes, Section 466.04 on the City’s upcoming 
general liability insurance renewal for plan year 2020-2021. 
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust (LMCIT) members that obtain liability coverage from LMCIT must 
decide whether to waive the statutory tort liability limits to the extent of the coverage purchased.  The 
decision has the following effects: 
• Member does not waive the statutory tort limits – an individual claimant would be able to recover 
no more than $500,000 on any claim to which the statutory tort limits apply.  The total all claimants 
would be able to recover for a single occurrence to which the statutory tort limits apply would be 
limited to $1,500,00.00 
 
• Member does waive the statutory tort limits and does not purchase excess liability coverage, a single 
claimant could potentially recover up to $2,000,000 for a single occurrence.  The total of all claimants 
would be able to recover for a single occurrence to which the statutory tort limits apply would also 
be limited to $2,000,000, regardless of the number of claimants. 
 
  Historically the City has chosen NOT to waive the $500,000 monetary limits on the municipal tort liability 
as described above.

LIABILITY COVERAGE – WAIVER FORM 
 
Members who obtain liability coverage through the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust (LMCIT) 
must complete and return this form to LMCIT before the member’s effective date of coverage. Return 
completed form to your underwriter or email to pstech@lmc.org.  
 
The decision to waive or not waive the statutory tort limits must be made annually by the  
member’s governing body, in consultation with its attorney if necessary. 
 
Members who obtain liability coverage from LMCIT must decide whether to waive the statutory tort liability limits 
to the extent of the coverage purchased.  The decision has the following effects: 
 
• 
If the member does not waive the statutory tort limits, an individual claimant could recover no more than 
$500,000 on any claim to which the statutory tort limits apply.  The total all claimants could recover for a single 
occurrence to which the statutory tort limits apply would be limited to $1,500,000.  These statutory tort limits 
would apply regardless of whether the member purchases the optional LMCIT excess liability coverage. 
 
 
• 
If the member waives the statutory tort limits and does not purchase excess liability coverage, a single claimant 
could recover up to $2,000,000 for a single occurrence (under the waive option, the tort cap liability limits are 
only waived to the extent of the member’s liability coverage limits, and the LMCIT per occurrence limit is 
$2,000,000). The total all claimants could recover for a single occurrence to which the statutory tort limits apply 
would also be limited to $2,000,000, regardless of the number of claimants.  
 
• 
If the member waives the statutory tort limits and purchases excess liability coverage, a single claimant could 
potentially recover an amount up to the limit of the coverage purchased.  The total all claimants could recover for 
a single occurrence to which the statutory tort limits apply would also be limited to the amount of coverage 
purchased, regardless of the number of claimants. 
 
Claims to which the statutory municipal tort limits do not apply are not affected by this decision.

statutory limit of $1.5 million; a more common figure is $2 million. LMCIT’s 
higher limit meets this requirement, but if even higher limits are required, 
there is the option to carry LMCIT’s excess liability coverage to meet the 
additional requirements. In some cases LMCIT, in partnership with its 
reinsurers, can also issue an endorsement to increase the city’s coverage limit 
only for claims relating to a particular contract. 
 
In addition to the LMCIT coverage limit of $2 million per occurrence, there 
are annual aggregate limits (that is, limits on the total amount of coverage for 
the year regardless of the number of claims), for certain specific risks. 
Aggregate limits apply to claims arising out of the following: 
 
 
 
See Section III.B, Data 
security breach and 
computer-related risks. 
 
See Section III.J, Land use 
and special risk litigation. 
 
See Section III.D, 
Employees’ activities in 
outside organizations. 
• Products  
 
 
 
$3 million annually 
• Failure to supply utilities  
 
$3 million annually 
• Data security breaches 
 
 
$3 million annually 
• Electromagnetic fields 
 
 
$3 million annually 
• Limited contamination 
                        $3 million annually 
• Land use/special risk litigation 
 
$1 million annually 
• Activities in outside organizations           $100,000 annually 
 
Failure to supply utilities applies to the failure to supply water, electricity, gas, 
or steam service. It also applies to damages arising out of the failure to supply 
phone and internet or other electronic data transmission services. 
 
Data security breach coverage carries a $250,000 annual aggregate/sublimit 
(part of and not in addition to the $3 million data security breach aggregate) 
for Payment Card Industry (PCI) fines and penalties and data security breach 
regulatory fines and penalties resulting from a data security breach claim. 
 
Limited contamination includes the sudden and accidental release of 
pollutants; herbicide and pesticide applications; sewer ruptures, overflows, 
and backups; lead and asbestos claims; mold claims; organic pathogen claims; 
hostile fire claims; and excavation and dredging claims. Excavation and 
dredging claims are subject to an annual $250,000 sublimit. These limits 
apply to both damages and defense costs. 
See Section III.J, Land use 
and special risk litigation. 
 
Land Use Incentive 
Program. 
Land use litigation coverage is provided on a sliding scale percentage basis, 
which is based on participation in LMCIT’s land use incentive. Coverage 
applies to both damages and litigation costs. 
 
2. 
Statutory liability limits  
Minn. Stat. § 466.04. 
The statutory municipal tort cap is limited to a maximum of $500,000 per 
claimant and $1.5 million per occurrence.  
RELEVANT LINKS: 
League of Minnesota Cities Information Memo:  
 
2/13/2017  
LMCIT Liability Coverage Guide 
 
Page 6 
 
These limits apply whether the claim is against the city, against the individual 
officer or employee, or against both. The LMCIT liability coverage provides a 
standard limit of $2 million per occurrence.  
See Summary of LMCIT 
Liability Coverage Options 
and the effects of choosing 
the various coverage 
structure options. 
At the city’s coverage renewal each year, it must decide whether to waive or 
not waive the statutory limits. There is no right or wrong answer on this point. 
It’s a discretionary question of city policy that each city council needs to 
decide for itself. 
 
a. 
Waiving the statutory limit 
 
Members who choose to waive the statutory limits are waiving the protection 
of the statutory limits, up to the amount of coverage the city has. Someone 
with a claim against a city that has waived the statutory limits would be able 
to recover up to the LMCIT standard limit of $2 million, rather than the 
statutory limit of $500,000 per claimant. Because the waiver increases the 
exposure, the premium is a few percentage points higher for coverage under 
the waiver option. 
 
A city may choose to pay more in premium for the waiver option because the 
statutory liability limit only comes into play in a case where the city is in fact 
liable and the injured party’s actual proven damages are greater than the 
statutory limit. Some cities as a matter of public policy may want to have 
more assets available to compensate their citizens for injuries caused by the 
city’s negligence. Waiving the statutory liability limits is a way to do that. 
 
There is no increase in risk if the city waives the statutory liability limits. In 
other words, there is no risk for the city to end up with liability if LMCIT 
doesn’t cover it. The LMCIT waiver form specifically says the city is waiving 
the statutory tort caps only to the extent of the city’s coverage. That’s not to 
say there is no risk the city’s liability could exceed its coverage limits. There 
are certain situations in which this could happen, but the waiver doesn’t 
increase that risk. 
See Section II.D.3, 
Purchasing higher liability 
limits. 
In those cases where the city waives the statutory limit, but also purchases the 
LMCIT excess liability coverage, a claimant could potentially recover more. 
For example, if the city has $1 million of excess coverage and chooses to 
waive the statutory tort caps, the claimants (whether it’s one claimant or 
several) could then potentially recover up to $2.5 million in damages in a 
single occurrence. If the city carries higher excess coverage limits, the 
potential maximum recovery per occurrence is correspondingly higher.  
See Section II.D.3, 
Purchasing higher liability 
limits. 
Carrying LMCIT’s excess coverage under the waiver option is a way to 
address an issue that some cities find troubling, and that’s: the case where 
many people are injured in a single occurrence caused by city negligence. An 
example is if a city vehicle negligently ran into a school bus full of children 
causing multiple serious injuries. 
RELEVANT LINKS: 
League of Minnesota Cities Information Memo:  
 
2/13/2017  
LMCIT Liability Coverage Guide 
 
Page 7 
 
The statutory limit of $1.5 million divided 50 ways may not go far in 
compensating those injuries. Excess coverage under the waiver option makes 
more funds available to compensate the victims in this kind of situation. 
See Section II.D.3, 
Purchasing higher liability 
limits. 
The cost of the excess liability coverage is about 25 percent greater if the city 
waives the statutory tort caps. The cost difference is proportionally greater 
than the cost difference at the primary level because for a city that carries 
excess coverage, waiving the statutory tort caps increases both the per 
claimant exposure and the per occurrence exposure. 
 
b. 
Not waiving the statutory limit  
 
 
 
See Section II.D.3.a, 
Statutory limits may not 
apply.   
For cities who choose not to waive the statutory limits, the city’s liability is 
limited by the statute to no more than $500,000 per claimant and $1.5 million 
per occurrence. LMCIT’s higher coverage limits would only come into play 
on those types of claims that aren’t covered by the statutory limit. 
 
3. 
Purchasing higher liability limits 
 
LMCIT makes available the option of carrying higher coverage limits than the 
basic limit of $2 million per occurrence. This coverage, called excess liability 
coverage, is available in $1 million increments up to a maximum of $5 
million.  
 
There are several different reasons why cities may consider carrying LMCIT’s 
excess liability coverage.  
 
a. 
Statutory limits may not apply 
Minn. Stat. § 3.736. 
 
The statutory tort caps either do not or may not apply to several types of 
claims. Some examples include:  
 
• Claims under federal civil rights laws. These include Section 1983, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, and so on.  
• Claims for tort liability the city has assumed by contract. This occurs 
when a city agrees in a contract to defend and indemnify a private party. 
• Claims for actions in another state. This might occur in border cities that 
have mutual aid agreements with adjoining states or when a city official 
attends a national conference or goes to Washington to lobby. 
• Claims based on liquor sales. This mostly affects cities with municipal 
liquor stores, but it could also arise in connection with beer sales at a fire 
relief association fundraiser, for example. 
• Claims based on a “taking” theory. Suits challenging land use regulations 
frequently include an “inverse condemnation” claim, alleging the 
regulation amounts to a “taking” of the property.

Item Description: 
Reclassification of Full-time Lead Liquor Store Clerk 
Position from Grade 4 to Grade 5. 
 
Reviewed By: Clay Wilfahrt, City Administrator 
 
Reviewed By: Personnel Committee 
 
 
ACTION REQUESTED 
By approving this item on the Consent Agenda, Council would be approving the reclassification of the Full-
time Lead Liquor Store Clerk position from a grade 4 to a grade 5 on the City of Big Lake’s pay scale. 
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
During the budget process staff always reviews the pay grades with communities of the same size to verify 
that the City’s pay scale is still in-line with the market.  Currently staff reviewed the Full-time Lead Liquor 
Store Clerk position prior to posting and determined that the current City’s pay scale for this position is 
below the market.  Staff scored the position based on the Class Evaluation System that was provided by 
Springsted and is used for the biennial pay equity reporting that the City must do for the State. The scoring 
indicated that this position should in fact be at a grade higher.  By moving this position to the correct grade 
the pay will be more in line with the current market rate and will be beneficial for the current replacement 
of this position.  The current pay range for this position is $13.41 to $16.99; with the reclassification to grade 
5 the pay range would be $14.21 to $18.01. 
 
 
FINANCIAL IMPACT 
No impact on 2020 Budget, future budgets could see an increase in personnel expenditures

Section 1 – Introduction 
1.1 
Introduction 
Hazard mitigation is defined as any sustained action to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to human life 
and property from hazards. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has made reducing 
hazards one of its primary goals; hazard mitigation planning and the subsequent implementation of 
resulting projects, measures, and policies is a primary mechanism in achieving FEMA’s goal.  
From 1980-2018, the cost of damages due to natural disasters in the U.S. has exceeded $1.6 trillion.  
2017 was a record year with $306 billion in damage (NOAA, n.d.). While the costliest disasters may 
occur in the coastal states, in 2018, wildfires, hailstorms, drought, and tornadoes caused many billion-
dollar disasters across the nation.  
Hazard mitigation planning and preparedness will be the most effective instrument to diminish losses 
by reducing the impact of disasters upon people and property. Although mitigation efforts will not 
eliminate all disasters, each county shall endeavor to be as prepared as possible for a disaster.  
The Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan (MHMP) is a requirement of the Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 
2000 (DMA 2000). The development of a local government plan is required in order to maintain 
eligibility for federal hazard mitigation grant funding programs. In order for communities to be eligible 
for future mitigation funds, they must adopt an MHMP.  
Researchers at the National Institute of Building Sciences looked at the results of 23 years of federally 
funded mitigation grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. 
Economic Development Administration (EDA) and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) and found mitigation funding can save the nation $6 in future disaster costs, for 
every $1 spent on hazard mitigation (National Institute of Building Sciences, 2017). 
Sherburne County is vulnerable to a variety of potential natural disasters, which threaten the loss of life 
and property in the county. Hazards such as tornadoes, flooding, wildfires, blizzards, straight-line 
winds, ice storms and droughts have the potential for inflicting vast economic loss and personal 
hardship. In 2013, Minnesota had some of the highest weather-related disaster claims in the country 
(MN Environmental Quality Board, 2014).       
This Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan represents the efforts of Sherburne County and its local governments 
to fulfill the responsibility for hazard mitigation planning. The intent of the plan is to reduce the actual 
threat of specific hazards by limiting the impact of damages and losses. 
1.1.1 Scope 
The Sherburne County Emergency Management Director and U-Spatial@UMD have combined efforts 
to update the 2013 Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan. U-Spatial@UMD contracted with 
Hundrieser Consulting LLC for additional emergency management planning expertise and facilitation. 
Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, 2020 
Page | 9 
This Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan evaluates and ranks the major natural hazards affecting Sherburne 
County as determined by frequency of event, economic impact, deaths and injuries. Mitigation 
recommendations are based on input from state and local agencies, public input and national best 
practices. 
U-Spatial@UMD performed the hazard risk assessment for 1% annual chance floods using the FEMA
Hazus GIS tool. The Minnesota Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) office has
determined that Hazus should play a critical role in Minnesota’s risk assessments.
This is a multi-jurisdictional plan that covers Sherburne County, including the cities of Becker, Big Lake, 
Clear Lake, Elk River and Zimmerman, as well as the townships of Baldwin, Becker, Big Lake, Blue Hill, 
Clear Lake, Haven, Livonia, Orrock, Palmer and Santiago. The plan additionally covers the portions of 
the cities of St. Cloud and Princeton that are located within Sherburne County. These cities have 
adopted the Sherburne County plan as well as the primary county in which they reside (Stearns and 
Mille Lacs). The Sherburne County risks and mitigation activities identified in this plan also incorporate 
the concerns and needs of school districts and other agencies participating in this plan.  
Members from each of these jurisdictions actively participated in the planning process by attending 
workgroup meetings, providing information, suggesting mitigation strategies and reviewing the plan 
document. Appendix K – Local Mitigation Survey Report includes jurisdictionally-specific input. The 
information in these forms was used to help identify mitigation actions for local implementation (see 
also Section 2.2). Each jurisdiction will adopt the plan by resolution after approval by FEMA. County and 
local city resolutions will be added by Sherburne County after final approval by FEMA, in Appendix D in 
the back of the plan.  
Sherburne County has specified the following goals for this Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan update: 

Include more recent data documenting the critical infrastructure and hazards faced by
Sherburne County.

Reformat and reorganize the plan to reflect definitions of hazards as expressed in the 2014
State of Minnesota Multi-Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Plan.

Reflect current hazard mitigation priorities in Sherburne County.
1.1.2 Hazard Mitigation Definition 
Hazard mitigation may be defined as any action taken to eliminate or reduce the long-term risk to 
human life and property from natural hazards. Following are examples of hazard mitigation measures 
that fall within one of five types of mitigation strategies: 

Planning – Development of mitigation standards, regulations, policies, and programs.

Structure and Infrastructure Projects – Structural retrofits, property acquisition, local flood
reduction projects, and safe room construction.

Natural Systems Protection – Sediment and erosion control, stream corridor restoration, forest
and vegetative management, floodplain and stream restoration.
Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, 2020 
Page | 10 

Education and Awareness Programs – Outreach programs, hazard awareness campaigns, real
estate disclosure, and promotion of family/personal emergency preparedness.

Mitigation Preparedness & Response Support – Emergency planning and services such as
warning siren systems, CodeRED, and installing generators for critical facilities.
1.1.3 Benefits of Mitigation Planning 
The benefits of hazard mitigation planning include the following: 

Saving lives, protecting the health of the public, and reducing injuries

Preventing or reducing property damage

Reducing economic losses

Minimizing social dislocation and stress

Reducing agricultural losses

Maintaining critical facilities in functioning order

Protecting infrastructure from damage

Protecting mental health

Reducing legal liability of government and public officials
1.2 
State Administration of Mitigation Grants
FEMA currently has three mitigation grant programs that are administered by the State of Minnesota: 
the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program (PDM), and the 
Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program. The HMGP, PDM and FMA programs are administered 
through the state of Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Division of Homeland Security and 
Emergency Management. All applicants must have or be covered under an approved Hazard Mitigation 
Plan. Eligible applicants include state and local governments; certain private non-profit organizations or 
institutions; and tribal communities.

Jurisdictional representatives participating on the steering committee were contacted throughout the 
plan update process to help facilitate local participation and provide feedback on the hazards of 
concern to their community. Information was used to develop local mitigation actions which they 
would seek to implement upon plan adoption (see Section 5.3.2 and Appendix G Mitigation Actions by 
Jurisdiction). 
2.2 
Review of Existing Plans, Capabilities & Vulnerabilities 
Sherburne County and its local communities utilized a variety of planning documents to direct 
community development. These documents include a Comprehensive/Master Plan, Emergency 
Operations Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, Stormwater Management Plan, Transportation Plan, 
etc. (see Appendix J for a full listing of plans and programs in place in Sherburne County). The planning 
process also incorporated the existing natural hazard mitigation elements from previous planning 
efforts. In addition, the 2019 Minnesota All-Hazard Mitigation Plan was consulted.  
In the development of the Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, U-Spatial@UMD 
consultants reviewed and incorporated a variety of planning documents that direct community 
development and influence land use decisions for the county and its jurisdictions. In addition, U-
Spatial@UMD consultants worked closely with the Sherburne County Emergency Management 
Director, other key county staff, and local city officials to collect specific feedback on local mitigation 
capabilities and vulnerabilities that either support or hinder the ability to mitigate against natural 
hazards at the county and local level. Following is a summary of the assessment tools used to gather 
information on local capabilities and vulnerabilities during the planning process: 
Capabilities Assessment (hazard specific) – In this assessment, detailed information was collected on 
current Plans and Programs in Place and Program Gaps or Deficiencies that currently exist to mitigate 
destruction caused by each natural hazard addressed in the plan. This information was used to inform 
where there were current mechanisms in place to incorporate or implement mitigation measures (i.e., 
existing programs, plans or policies) and where there were areas that needed to be addressed. Section 
4.3 Hazard Profiles identifies current gaps and deficiencies for mitigation and Section 5.1.3 Plans and 
Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, 2020 
Page | 13 
Programs in Place to Address Natural Hazards describes the mitigation capabilities that are in place to 
support mitigation. 
Local Mitigation Surveys – As part of Sherburne County’s 2020 Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan update, 
participating jurisdictions and key county personnel were asked to fill out a two-part “Local Mitigation 
Survey” (LMS) form. Part A: “Past Events & Vulnerability Assessment” collected detailed information 
from each jurisdiction on the following: 1) Severe weather or disaster events & impacts that have 
occurred within the last five years; 2) Actions taken within the last five years that have helped 
reduce local vulnerabilities to future disaster events; 3) Any changes within the last five years that 
have increased local vulnerabilities to future disaster events; and 4) Any concerns or specific ideas for 
mitigation projects to help reduce or eliminate risk resulting from future severe weather or disaster 
events. Part B: “Local Mitigation Capabilities Assessment” collected detailed information on each 
jurisdiction’s capabilities in place to help support mitigation in the community, including: 1) Plans, 
authorities, or policies; 2) Staff (organizational capacity); 3) Programs; and 4) Funding or other 
resources. Information was further collected on what program gaps or deficiencies exist that are a 
barrier to accomplishing mitigation in the community. 
Information from the LMS forms was used to inform Section 4, Risk Assessment and the development 
of local-level mitigation actions (see Appendix G: Mitigation Actions by Jurisdiction). 
2.3 
Planning Process Timeline and Steps 
In order to update the 2013 Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, U-Spatial@UMD 
consultants worked in coordination with the Sherburne County Emergency Management Director and 
members of the steering committee. The updated plan includes not only new data documenting the 
types of hazards faced by Sherburne County residents and emergency planning officials, but also new 
thinking about how to best address these hazards. 
2.3.1 Sherburne County Stakeholder Coordination 
On January 3, 2019, U-Spatial@UMD hosted a kickoff meeting online that was attended by the 
Sherburne County Emergency Management Director. The webinar included a project overview, U-
Spatial@UMD background, the roles and responsibilities of the Emergency Management Director, 
contents of the Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, planning process and projected timeline (see Appendix E 
for webinar slides).  
On January 3, 2019, Sherburne County issued a news release inviting public feedback and participation 
for the Sherburne County MHMP update (for complete documentation, see Appendix F: Public Outreach 
& Engagement Documentation).  
A steering committee meeting took place on May 31, 2019, at the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office in 
Elk River, which included the Sherburne County MHMP steering committee and members of the U-
Spatial@UMD planning team. The steering committee was provided with an overview of the purpose, 
process and timeline for the Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan update, as well as the role 
Sherburne County Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, 2020 
Page | 14 
and responsibilities of steering committee members. Appendix E provides documentation of steering 
committee meeting summaries, including participant sign-in sheets and presentation slides.   
Steering committee members were engaged in providing feedback on plans and programs in place as 
they relate to hazards facing the county, and they discussed potential mitigation actions to be added to 
the plan. This information was used to inform the development of mitigation strategies in the updated 
plan. 
On December 17, 2019, members of the steering committee convened again with the U-Spatial@UMD 
planning team to conduct a review of the risk assessment presented in the plan and discussion of the 
draft mitigation action charts developed for Sherburne County and each of the city jurisdictions 
participating in the plan. See Appendix E for a full meeting summary.  
In order to provide opportunity for public input, Sherburne County issued a second new release on 
January 13, 2020, inviting public review and feedback on the draft plan. The news release provided 
information on where the plan could be viewed and comments submitted. U-Spatial@UMD hosted a 
webpage to post the full draft Sherburne County MHMP, including excerpts of the Sherburne County 
Master Mitigation Action Chart, each of the jurisdictional mitigation action charts, and an electronic 
feedback form.  
Appendix F provides documentation of the public outreach for feedback on the draft plan by Sherburne 
County and jurisdictions. The public feedback period for the draft plan was open from January 13, 2020, 
to January 27, 2020, for a total of 15 days.

ACTION REQUESTED 
Motion to Approve the Construction Proposal submitted by Ken Geroux Construction dated June 1, 2020 
for the replacement of siding at the Big Lake City Hall facility. 
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
In January 2020, Council approved the replacement of the windows and employee entrance doors at City 
Hall.  This project has begun and during the installation of the windows some structural deficiencies were 
noticed.  These deficiencies need to be addressed and are as follows: 
 
• A large amount of the siding, predominately on the south side, is failing.  Several locations are rotten, 
cracked and deformed. 
o This allows exterior moisture, which can lead to damage of the structural components of the 
building. 
• There is no exterior moisture barrier installed on the building, meaning the siding is the only barrier 
that is protecting the wall sheathing. With the siding failing there is no secondary protection to the 
structure. 
• The fiber sheathing under the windows has failed and needs to be replaced.   
• There is substantial air movement between the interior and exterior through the wall cavity under 
the windows. 
• Possibility that the insulation is also failing under the windows. 
  
 Ken Geroux Construction is recommending that all existing cedar planks and trim be removed, to inspect 
exterior sheathing and visible structure.  Mr. Geroux is also recommending the following: 
• Replace sheathing under windows as required 
• Install flashing over all openings 
• Install adhesive window wrap 
• Install Tyvek House wrap with taped seams 
• Install cladding to transitions as needed 
• Install Certinteed Monogram 0.46 vinyl siding in a Natural Clay color to match with the bricks and 
other building 
 
Staff is also asking Mr. Geroux to include in the proposal replacing the Southside entrance, by the senior 
center, weather-strip the main door and remove the window in the Council Chambers.  Staff believes that it 
would be in the City’s best interest to reside the entire building at this time instead of attempting repairs in 
limited areas as well as updating the entrances doors and removing the window in the Council Chambers.  
 
AGENDA ITEM 
Big Lake City Council 
 
 
FINANCIAL IMPACT 
The cost of the siding replacement and doors will be taken out of the CIP Funds 199 from prior year funds 
that were allocated for City Hall improvements.  Although staff is unable to quantify the savings on energy 
cost, staff does believe that the City will see a savings.  The proposal that has been received is $39,462.33. 
 
ALTERNATIVES 
Do not look at doing any of the improvements at this time and try to put back on old siding.

Item Description: 
Agreement for AIS watercraft inspection services with the 
Sherburne Soil and Water Conservation District  
Reviewed By: Clay Wilfahrt, City Administrator 
 
Reviewed By: Deb Wegeleben, Finance Director  
 
 
ACTION REQUESTED 
Motion to approve entering into an agreement with Sherburne County Soil and Water Conservation 
District to provide 632 hours of watercraft inspection at Lakeside Park boat launch in 2020. 
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) inspections have been taking place at Lakeside Park for several years under 
the direction of the Sherburne Soil and Water Conservation District.  The City of Big Lake, the Big Lake 
Community Lake Association (BLCLA) and Sherburne Soil and Water Conservation District (SSWCD) had 
planned to provide inspection using a combination of Level 1 inspectors and volunteers to provide an 
inspection and education program to assist in preventing AIS from entering Big Lake and Lake Mitchell.  Due 
to COVID-19, the DNR has suspended certifying AIS volunteers and have not indicated that they will resume 
any time soon.  Thus, the City and BLCLA can’t provide trained personnel (volunteers) to perform inspections.  
AIS inspection allocated by the SSWCD is limited and will conclude mid-June.  
 
At the last Council work session, Council concurred with Staff’s preference to provide a presence using part-
time seasonal employees to perform a Park survey and provide some AIS outreach. Using part-time seasonal 
employees at a lower hourly rate provided more presence throughout the summer but without inspection 
capability.  Since the Workshop, BLCLA expressed strong support for Level 1 inspection rather than a 
presence and they offered to provide some cost share coverage by WaterGuards, LLC.  I have been closely 
monitoring WaterGuards, LLC and interacting with the on-site AIS inspectors over the last few weeks.  I have 
become confident that they will deliver services as promised. 
 
 Staff has had several discussions and a meeting with BLCLA representatives.  This has resulted in:  
• Understanding that BLCLA desires higher level of inspection than the preferred option as discussed at 
last Council workshop. 
• BLCLA is committed to 252 hours of Level 1 inspection and will reimburse the City for 252 hours.  
• City Staff recommending contribution of 380 hours of Level 1 inspection (within our budget). 
• A combined 632 hours provides coverage Wednesday through Sunday (mid-June through Labor Day). 
• Saturdays are expected to be the busiest day and will have a double shift. 
• Due to weather, some hours will likely be saved and could be applied toward September weekends after 
Labor Day. 
• Staff found significant value that AIS inspections through SSWCD will benefit the Lakes.   
 
AGENDA ITEM 
Big Lake City Council 
The attached agreement is the same agreement from 2018 and 2019 with revisions to hours and costs.  The 
2018 agreement had been reviewed by the City Attorney.  If it moves forward, the AIS inspector 
performance will be monitored by Staff and BLCLA closely this summer.   
  
FINANCIAL IMPACT 
The agreement is for $12,008 and the City’s portion is $7,220 and is within budget.  After this year, the 
remaining funds from the Michelob Celebrate Your Lakes Grant will be used up.   The BLCLA will provide 
reimbursement of $4,788 as part of a forthcoming agreement. 
 
ALTERNATIVES 
The following alternatives presented to Council are subject to adjustment based on Council discussion.   
1. Direct staff to bring forth agreement with SSWCD for AIS inspection services. 
2. Direct staff to have part-time seasonal employees provide a presence without inspection capabilities. 
 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION 
The BLCLA has provided a significant contribution towards AIS inspections.  Their contribution has changed 
Staff’s previous position regarding the preferred alternate.  The City’s costs for Alternate 1 are only slightly 
more than Alternate 2, but gain a Level 1 inspector protecting the Lakes over the same duration of the 
summer.  Staff recommends Alternate 1. 
 
ATTACHMENTS

Adjustment of temporary wage change for Non-Exempt liquor 
store staff.  
 
Reviewed By: Clay Wilfahrt, City Administrator 
 
Reviewed By: Deb Wegeleben, Finance Director 
 
 
ACTION REQUESTED 
A motion to approve an adjustment to the temporary pay increase from $4.00 per hour to $2.00 per hour 
for all Non-Exempt Liquor Store Staff effective June 11, 2020. 
 
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
Covid-19 has had a major impact on the operations and staff of Lake Liquors.  Current staff has been 
outstanding with their flexibility and commitment to the City of Big Lake and our customers.   
 
Beginning Monday, June 8th we will be expanding our hours of operation from 11am to 7pm on Monday 
through Saturday to 10am to 8pm Monday through Saturday.  Sunday hours will remain unchanged at 11am 
to 4pm.  This will increase our hours of operation by 12 hours per week.  This is similar to what some 
operations are proposing.  The goal is to increase customer service while reducing the intensity of business 
during store hours.  Lake Liquors continues to face a staffing challenge, but the filling of the full-time clerk 
position will assist in this matter. 
 
While there continues to be many unknowns, staff believes that the opening of bars and restaurants will 
have a financial impact at Lake Liquors.  Staff is looking for the most efficient, productive, and customer 
effective hours of operation.  Staff will continue to evaluate as changes in customer needs, staffing, and the 
cost of doing business occur. 
 
Staff is requesting that the temporary wage increase be adjusted from $4.00 per hour to $2.00 per hour 
because we are still operating under reduced hours and the hazard still exists.  It would address some of the 
payroll concerns while offering some continued support for non-exempt staff during these difficult times.  
 
 
FINANCIAL IMPACT 
During our current model we are open for 53 business hours per week. The new model will be at 65 business 
hours per week.  The pre-covid model was at 83 business hours per week.   
 
53 hours per week at $4.00 per hour equals a $212.00 increase.  65 hours per week at $2.00 per hour equals 
$130.00 increase.  This adjustment should show a net reduction in payroll expenses. 
 
 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM 
Big Lake City Council 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION 
Staff recommends an adjustment of the temporary hourly increase from $4.00 per hour to $2.00 per hour 
for all Non-Exempt Liquor Store Staff effective June 11, 2020.
