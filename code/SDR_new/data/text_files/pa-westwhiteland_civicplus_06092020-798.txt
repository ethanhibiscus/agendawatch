Notes:
1. Recommended coverage is 20lbs per acre.
2. Seed mix can be purchased from ERNST SEEDS at (800) 873-3321
or email at sales@ernstseed.com. Alternative suppliers / seed mixes
shall be approved by landscape architect before purchase.
3. Hand seeding is recommended and should take place between
April 1st and May 15th  or between September 1st and October 15th.
4. Immediately prior to seeding the soil is to be prepared so as to be
free of large clods, evenly smooth, and level.  A shallow tilling to a
depth of 2 inches is acceptable to break up soils in which the surface
has become crusted.
5. Planting areas shall be soaked to maintain a consistent level of
moisture for at least four (4) to six (6) weeks after seeding.
6. After hand seeding, each area is to be rolled to push the seeds
into firm contact with the soil and firm the seedbed. A firm seedbed is
critical to proper seedling growth.  Do not roll the site when the soil is
wet. Wait until the soil is drier to avoid compaction.  Alternatively a
cultipaker could be used to ensure soil to seed contact. If seeding in
the fall, this step is not required as the cumulative effect of rain and
snow with numerous freeze/thaw cycles will provide the necessary
soil to seed contact.
7. The seeding is to be mulched with North American Green S-150 BN
(biodegradable erosion blanket) and secured with Bio-stakes
(biodegradable anchors).
