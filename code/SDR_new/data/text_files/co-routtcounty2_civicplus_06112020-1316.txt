ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS 
 
1. Approval of Minutes – February 13, 2019

written. Robin seconded the motion.  The motion carried unanimously. 
 
II. 
PUBLIC COMMENT 
There was no public comment. 
 
III.   
COMMENTS FROM BOARD MEMBERS 
David thanked Kevin and Stacie for all their efforts in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
 
IV. 
NEW BUSINESS 
 
1. Budget Presentations (KSBS & YVRA)  
2 
Kevin and Stacie confirmed that their budgets would be presented to the YVAC for 
approval at the August 13th meeting. Larry suggested that they should be submitted prior 
to that, even if in draft form, to the Finance Committee to allow time for review and 
questions. Stacie said that a draft of the KSBS budget would be available for review and 
discussion in June or July. Kevin said that the YVRA budget would not available until 
later, after the initial review by the County. Both Stacie and Kevin will work with the 
Finance Committee prior to submitting their budgets to the YVAC. 
 
2. CDOT Aeronautics’ EIS Methodology  
Randy reviewed the direct and indirect contributions to the local economy by visitors to 
the Yampa Valley that make up the figures cited in the CDOT calculation of the impact 
of the airports on the economy. He said that an average visitor coming by car spends 
approximately $1300 during a 6-day trip. An air traveler spends $4200 on the same 
length stay. The direct impact of the airport includes airport employees, airport services 
and equipment, etc. The indirect impact includes hotels, restaurants, retail, etc. Randy 
explained the multiplier effect created as the dollars brought in by tourists circulate 
through the economy. Following discussion, it was decided that the CDOT numbers are 
legitimate, and should be used in the presentations. In response to a request from David, 
Randy said he would prepare a brief statement explaining the calculation. 
 
3. COVID-19/Airport, Capital, Infrastructure Update - YVRA  
Kevin stated that the drop off in passengers that occurred when the ski area closed cut 
about two weeks off the normal 16-week direct flight season. He estimated that this 
would result in a 10% - 13% reduction in revenue for the year. Kevin said that COVID-
19 also precipitated the demise of Trans States, which had been operating the Denver 
(UA) flights. Sky West is now providing the Denver service, which has been reduced to 
one flight per day. Kevin said that ridership is minimal. He said that airports are 
considered critical infrastructure, and so will remain open. He said that 10 – 16 
employees continue to work at the airport while maintaining social distancing. Masks are 
worn if multiple employees are working in the same room.  
 
Kevin said that the revenue projections for YVRA assume that there will be no 
passengers through the end of June, with 50% load factors for the remainder of the year. 
These projections will be revised as circumstances change. He noted that from December 
through the first half of March had been very good. Kevin said that they are currently 
planning for a full direct flight schedule beginning in December. He said that YVRA is in 
line for financial assistance through the CARES Act. 
 
Sonja asked whether incoming passengers were being asked to quarantine upon arrival. 
Doug offered that no quarantine regulations are in place. Added, that it  
would be difficult to enforce. He said that there is also a concern regarding second 
homeowners. Did not know if they would allowed to use their properties. He offered that 
public messaging might help. Following discussion, Kevin agreed to post signs with self-
isolation recommendations for arriving passengers, and said that he would raise the topic 
at the next EOC meeting. He said that both YVRA restaurants are open, with limited 
access, for carry-out only.  
 
Kevin said that the terminal expansion and renovation project is moving forward, with 
work to begin in just over a week. He described the additional holding room and ticketing 
area being constructed for Southwest, and the automatic sliding door vestibules being 
3 
installed to help mitigate the temperature in the terminal. He said the project is scheduled 
to be complete by October 31st. Kevin said that all other capital projects are being 
reviewed in light of revenue shortfalls and would be presented to the BCC soon. He noted 
that the $1.5 million dollar supplemental grant will ensure a positive bottom line for 
2020, even with the loss of revenue. Kevin said that the contractor hired to do the 
terminal project would comply with distancing guidelines and wellness checks. He said 
that the crews would be relatively small, and would be sequenced. 
 
David asked about the situational awareness display equipment. Kevin reported that the 
initial bid came in at $250,000, which was unacceptable. Robin asked if additional phone 
charging stations would be installed, particularly in the arrivals area. Kevin said that that 
is not in the plan, but that the new gate will have better access for charging and more 
chargers will be added to the other gates.  
 
David asked about changes to the ramp operations caused by the move of Atlantic to its 
new FBO. Kevin said that there were some issues at first, but that the problems were 
addressed. 
 
4. COVID-19/Airport, Capital, Infrastructure Update – KSBS 
Stacie reported on the recent economic, staffing and facilities challenges at KSBS. She 
said that the FBO was closed for a day for disinfection, and now has a cleaning contract 
in place. She reported that one employee was infected and another had recently travelled, 
so both were out for 14 days, and a third employee, who is over 60, is not working. Stacie 
said that she and one other person ran the airport by themselves for two weeks. 
 
Stacie said that most of the traffic is currently medical, with some local and training 
flights. She said that she would also put up signs with recommendations for those coming 
in from elsewhere. Stacie said that it would be difficult to project the impact of COVID-
19 on KSBS revenue, but that she has cut $40,000 from her budget through reductions in 
staff hours and pay, deferring the fuel canopy move and the purchase of a snowblower. 
All meetings and travel have also been cancelled. 
 
Stacie said that the planned runway painting project is scheduled for the end of May, to 
be paid for with a CDOT grant. This project will take one day. The crack filling will be 
done by a local vendor, and will also take one day. 
 
In response to a question from David, Stacie said that Honey Stinger had moved into the 
Airport Office Building on April 1st and is sub-leasing to Smartwool through July 1st. She 
said that the lease is very similar to the lease held by Smartwool, and that Smartwool had 
paid back the loans taken out for remodeling the facility. 
 
5. VOR Equipment/Service Update 
Stacie said that the emails and letters seemed to have helped, and that SBS had been 
removed from the list of VORs to be de-commissioned. 
 
6. Air Service Update 
Janet reviewed the process through which visitors left town when the ski area closed and 
flights cancelled. She said that she expects the total seat capacity for the season to be 
about 14% below forecast, with 11% fewer than expected passengers. The revenue 
guarantee program will be unaffected. Janet said she is trying to maintain the connections 
4 
with the airline partners, and is assuming that the full schedule of direct flights, including 
the new Southwest flight, will resume next winter.  
 
7. Atlantic Aviation 
Pat reported that all employees are still working, but that activity has been very low. He 
said that the FBO is disinfected three time per day and after visitors. Pat said that Atlantic 
is still planning on finishing up the site work in May, but that much remain uncertain. He 
said he would also agree to post signs for arriving passengers and crews. 
 
8. Go Alpine 
Betty reported that Go Alpine is still open, but ridership is way down. She described the 
measures being taken to maintain social distancing and protect drivers and passengers. 
Kevin commended Go Alpine for contracting to provide medical transports, if needed. 
 
9. American Airlines 
Perry said that American plans to run very lean through the end of the year, but 
acknowledged that the situation remains fluid. 
 
 
V.   
REPORTS FROM YVAC COMMITTEES 
 
1. Community Outreach and Education 
David said that he would update the presentation to include the new CDOT economic 
impact data, with an explanation of the change in numbers. 
 
2. Marketing and Planning 
Janet suggested that this committee could be combined with the Outreach committee. 
Robin agreed that the committee structure needs to be revisited to ensure that the 
committees are meaningful. David asked all members to consider how the committees 
could be reorganized in preparation for a discussion of the issue in June. 
 
3. Infrastructure and Finance 
David said that the committee would meet with Stacie and Kevin over the summer to 
review the airport budgets.

 The Airport Manager continues to exercise the Airport Contingency Plan for COVID19.  
The FBO continues to operate from 7 am to 5pm, 365 days a year and the Airport 
remains open 24/7 as required by FAA and CDOT.  The FBO has been operating with 
limited service and will open to the public again on June 8th, with COVID19 mitigations 
in place.  The FBO will be the first City building to re-open to the public.  Airport/FBO 
employees continue to work a 36- hour work week due to City budget cuts.   
 The Airport runway and ramp were painted on May 18th with a grant from CDOT.  
Ginger Scott, City Grant Writer, wrote the grant request and Chris Leary, the Airport 
Senior Maintenance Technician, oversaw the entire project.  The tenants and users have 
commented on how nice it is.  See photo on the cover.

 The rental of the B-6 small transient hangar yielded the FBO $3,025.00 in the first 
quarter of the year.   
 The Civil Air Patrol from the Rocky Mountain Metro Squadron, in the Denver metro 
area, delivered PPE for Casey’s Pond (see photo below). 
 
 
 Aircraft continue to return to KSBS as more businesses re-open in Steamboat Springs.  
See photo below. 
 
Events 
 
 The Airport Manager attended a Zoom Yampa Valley Airport Commission (YVAC) 
meeting.  She provided updates on Airport and FBO operations during COVID19 and the 
status of upcoming CIP, including City budget cuts, the delay in the design of moving the 
fuel parking structure, and crack repair and painting of the runway and ramp that will 
move forward this spring.   
 The Colorado Pilot’s Association (CPA) still plans to conduct a Fly-In to KSBS on July 
11-12th for the Balloon Festival (if it occurs).  The Airport is preparing for 10-20 
airplanes to arrive that weekend.

Airport Manager Initiatives 
 KSBS was notified that the Airport will be receiving a $30K grant through the Cares Act 
for Airports.  The City Grants Writer has completed the application and it will be 
submitted this week.  
 The Airport Manager worked with the Master Plan consultants to develop Minimum 
Standards and Rules and Regulations for the Airport.  These documents have been 
socialized with the tenants, users, and commercial aeronautical operators at the Airport. 
They are currently being reviewed by the Legal Department and management for 
adoption.   
 The Airport Manager continues to have discussions with the District Chief and Aviation 
Unit Chief to implement a Land Use Agreement (LUA) for a Class 3 (Mobile) Single 
Engine Air Tanker (SEAT) base at the airport.  This LUA would support up to six aircraft 
during fire season and would begin this summer.    
 The Airport continues to have a problem with enough hangars to accommodate pilots and 
aircraft that want to be based at KSBS.  The hangar wait list currently totals 22, with 
Cirrus and large Piper aircraft in most need of hangar space.  She is also working with the 
FAA and Master Plan consultants to designate some land for developers to build new 
airport hangars that is in coordination with the update to the Airport Master Plan.  A 
Category Exclusion (CATEX) for the hangar, fuel truck parking, parking lot, and north 
helicopter development areas is currently being reviewed by the FAA.  This will allow 
the Airport to open land for bid for hangar development once the Master Plan is 
completed.   
 The Airport Manager is working with Master Plan consultants in researching options for 
the hangars that have ground leases with reversion clauses that expire within the next ten 
years.  The precedent set for these hangars should also apply to those hangars with future 
expiration dates.  The Airport Manager will provide City Staff and City Council some 
options for consideration. This topic was introduced to Tenants and Users of the Airport 
during a meeting on February 12th and the Airport Manger continues to keep everyone 
updated.
