Regular Meeting - Developer 
 
Presentation: 
The LandDesign Project Team, Mark Kime and Mason Greeson, presented to Council Members the Potter 
Road - Single Family Development to be built by Stanley Martin Homes.   The project, located off of 
Potter Road, encompasses 41.31 acres and plans for 113 lots.  Elevations and site plans were included in 
the presentation. The presentation is attached as part of the record. 
 
Council’s Comments are as follows: 
Council Member Morse asked why the Development Team is requesting for this project to be annexed 
into Indian Trail and not staying with the County.  Mr. Greeson stated they require more density.  Council 
Member Morse expressed concerns about their being too many homes and stated the lots need to be larger 
as the surrounding areas have approximately one-acre lots.  He noted moving from R40 to SF5 is a large 
jump.   
 
Council Member Barber inquired as to the number of entrances.  Mr. Greeson stated there are two main 
entrances and a third to an existing adjoining neighborhood.  Council Member Barber asked if this 
neighborhood was partnered with surrounding neighborhoods, and if it had a club house or any amenities.  
Mr. Greeson stated it was not associated with surrounding communities and does not offer any amenities.  
 
Mayor Alvarez asked if the Town of Weddington had been approached for annexation; Mr. Greeson 
stated they had not.  
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 10
Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre asked about their efforts to acquire surrounding properties.  Mr. Greeson 
responded they are negotiating for the large triangular piece but do not have an agreement at this time.  
Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre also stated 8,000 sf lots are too small, equaling less than ¼ acre.  The size 
needs to be in line with the vision of the Town.  
 
Mayor Alvarez stated comments would be returned to the project’s Development Team by the Town 
Manager.

10  NEW BUSINESS 
a. Pay off Crooked Creek Park Debt 
Mr. Jim Wojtowicz recommended for the Town to pay off the Installment Loan for the Crooked Creek 
Park.    The balanced owed on the loan is $315,625 which includes the principal balance of $312,500 plus 
$3,125 in a 1% pre-payment penalty.  The Town will save approximately $8,000 over the next two years 
in interest.   
MOTION was made by Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre to satisfy the loan this year and was unanimously 
approved.  
b. Proposed FY20-21 Budget Presentation  
Mr. Allen reviewed with Council the changes to the budget following the Budget Workshop.  He stated 
that despite the COVID-19 Crisis, the Town would end the year in sound financial condition.  He stated 
the pandemic has affected the proposed FY20-21 Budget resulting in a reduction in sales tax projections 
and hiring freeze leaving the General Fund flat.    Currently, there are five open positions; unused funding 
for these positions will help fill the gap in lost sales tax revenue.  Mr. Allen reported while there were 
changes in some positions, there were no new net positions.  He reported the largest increase in the FY20-
21 Budget from last year is in the UCSO Contract.   
 
Mr. Allen reported the Powell Bill Fund is up 5% from the previous year, and the Stormwater Fund is 
presenting as doubled.  He explained that some of the stormwater work budgeted for this year was not 
spent and those funds have rolled over to the FY20-21 fiscal year.  Once these projects are completed and 
the funds expended, there will still be a substantial balance in the Stormwater Fund.  
 
The Budget Hearing is scheduled for June 9, 2020.  Mr. Allen informed Council Members they can make 
changes after the hearing.   The proposed FY20-21 Budget will be considered for adoption on June 23, 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 12
2020.  The public was encouraged to send comments or participate in the meeting on June 9.  Comments 
received will be read at either the June 9 meeting or the June 23 meeting.  
 
Council Member Morse affirmed that Council could make changes following the June 9 meeting but does 
not foresee making any changes.   Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre stated the summary of changes was helpful 
and commended Mr. Allen for his work.    Overall, Council Members felt they had a lot of input during 
the budgeting process. 
c. Internal Staff Summer Camp  
Hayden Kramer, Parks & Rec Manager, informed Council of the Town’s desire to hold a Summer Camp 
for internal staff only.  He stated there are six staff members and eleven children being considered.  Mr. 
Kramer noted this request is different from the summer camps held in previous years.  He stated this year 
the offering would be by staff only, no consultants or contract relations will be involved, and run for nine 
consecutive weeks.  Mr. Kramer noted that child-care may be an obstacle, and this plan will allow for 
staff to return to work and do their jobs.  Camp-in-a-Box can be also offered to citizens and delivered via 
pick-up or other safe method.  Mr. Kramer reported that there are other municipalities who are providing 
this benefit to their employees. 
 
Council Member Morse asked how it benefitted the community.  Mr. Kramer stated childcare is an issue.  
and this benefit could help prevent employees from being required to take FMLA leave to care for their 
children. Council Member Morse stated he is uncomfortable in denying the public this opportunity; He 
is in the “no” Camp. 
 
Council Member Head stated he is in favor of anything that will support the staff and allow them to return 
to work.  He and Council Member Howe expressed concerns about liabilities and Council Member Head 
asked Attorney Wolter if there were any liabilities in what is asked.  Attorney Wolter stated the citizens 
would be required to sign a liability waiver, and for the employees, this is a new benefit and she is not 
concerned about it being a liability to the Town.   
 
Council Member Barber stated this is proactive and is in favor of supporting staff.  
 
Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre stated he understands the need for the public but is willing to have this benefit 
for staff.   
 
Mayor Alvarez was also in favor of the idea. 
Council Members were in CONSENSUS to ask Attorney Wolter to draft an agreement to be presented 
at the June 9, 2020 meeting.  
d. 
Future Council Meeting - Meeting Style 
Mr. Allen requested to hear Council’s preference to either hold Council Meetings in person or continue 
to hold them virtually during the month of June, 2020.   
 
Council Members were in agreement to remain cautious and announced the meetings would continue to 
be held on June 9 and June 23 virtually at 6:30 p.m.  Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre wanted to ensure the 
public has ample opportunity to speak to Council at these meetings and requested for Ms. Queen to ensure 
the meeting were sufficiently advertised.   
 
Ms. Queen requested to address Council and noted that new legislation does not allow for Council to vote 
for at least 24-hours following a public hearing.   Attorney Wolter advised Council Members to open and 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 13
close the FY20-21 Budget Hearing on June 9, 2020, and then continue to receive comments and vote on 
the proposed FY20-21 Budget at the June 23, 2020 meeting.   Council was in agreement.   
 
MOTION was made by Council Member Barber to hold the Town Council Regular Meetings for June 
on June 9, 2020 and also on June 23, 2020 virtually at 6:30 p.m. and was unanimously approved.  
11.   DISCUSSION ITEMS 
a. 
Report on Ownership of Improvements for the Sheriff’s Office 
Attorney Wolter informed Council that there is not a lease on the rental of the property at 130 Blythe 
Drive for the Sheriff’s Department.  She stated she is in the process of creating a simple lease that will 
align with the duration that is consistent with the UCSO Service Agreement and that will also show 
ownership rights.  The fence will be Town Property, and the Shed, which is being constructed at the cost 
of the UCSO, will remain their property to do with as they wish.  Attorney Wolter stated it is likely they 
will leave the shed when they vacate the property.   
b. 
Roadway Abandonment Request  
Mr. Huntsinger informed Council Members that the owner of several parcels of land is requesting 
Council’s feedback on the owner’s interest in having a roadway/alley closed in the Rosemary Park 
Subdivision.   Mr. Huntsinger stated the property was established in the early 80s, was never developed, 
has small lots, septic issues, and requires two lots for building.  The owner has plans for the area but 
wanted to see if Council had any opposition to closing this small roadway.  Council Members reviewed 
drawings of the area and did not make any opposing comments.   Mr. Huntsinger stated he would follow 
up on the details but does not see a problem in this request.  He also noted there were other roads closed 
in the same area, and the area would be difficult to develop.      
 
Council Member Morse asked if this was the same area where a trucking company previously sought to 
rezone property; it was.  Mr. Huntsinger stated there is no water or sewer, and the County does not have 
a CIP plan for this area. 
c. 
Chestnut Parkway - Phase 3 Update  
Mr. Huntsinger stated the Town is ready to move forward with pursuing a contract with a right of way 
(ROW) acquisition firm for Phase 3 of Chestnut Parkway and wanted to know Council’s preference on 
moving forward.   He explained that NCDOT is holding off on ROW acquisitions as well as all activities 
for the U-5808 Chestnut Connector.   Council Members were in agreement that this roadway is part of 
the Town’s long-range plans and agreed to move forward with pursing a ROW acquisition firm for Phase 
III. 
Council Members were in CONSENSUS to move forward with the Right of Way Acquisition for Chestnut 
Parkway, Phase III.  
 
d. 
Old Monroe Road Status 
Council Member Morse requested clarification on the $1M paid and the $4M expected to be paid in $1M 
increments beginning in FY21-22 to NCDOT for the ROW acquisitions regarding the Old Monroe Road  
widening project and if the project was being delayed.  Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre stated he was clear in 
the e-mail send to Council Members that the Monroe Road Project is one of the projects being delayed 
(and Chestnut Parkway) by NCDOT for the next 12 months as a result of anticipated funding shortfalls 
in excess of $300M+.   NCDOT has instructed that in the next few months, CRTPO Members will receive 
an update as to the funding and if the Monroe Road ROW acquisition will commence; At this time, there  
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 14
are no certainties.   Council Member Morse asked if NCDOT”s suspension of the ROW acquisition 
equates to suspending future payments to NCDOT.  Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre stated this was not brought 
up for discussion among the CRTPO Members.  However, after speaking with Neil Burke, CRTPO, this 
is something Council will need to discuss.   
 
Council Member Morse stated he had reviewed the contract with NCDOT and did not see any protections 
for the Town regarding the Town not making payments when NCDOT does not deliver ROW 
acquisitions.  He asked if the Town was at risk.  Mr. Huntsinger stated the contract states under Item 11: 
Additional Provisions, that the Agreement is dependent upon the department having the funding.  
Attorney Wolter stated this is accurate and noted that while she has not read the agreement recently, if 
the project is not moving forward, the Town will not make the payments.  She advised she would give 
legal advice in Closed Session when and if needed, but for now, the Town has a year to monitor the 
situation.   
 
In response to Council Member Morse, 50% of the first $1M payment to NCDOT was paid from the Debt 
Service Capital Reserve Account and the other half was paid from the $10M Bond.  Of the $10M Bond, 
$500,000 was pulled down a few years back for use, but was never used.   Mayor Pro Tem McIntyre 
stated the Town has been paying on the $500,000 for a while.  Currently, $322,000 in principal is owed 
on the initial $500,000.  Attorney Wolter reminded Council Members that the $10M bond will expire on 
November 2021, and cannot be extended.   
12.   MANAGER’S UPDATE 
Mr. Allen discussed the Town’s ongoing preparations and efforts regarding COVID-19.  He informed 
Council that the State entered Phase II last Friday.  As a result, the Town has opened amenities that are 
conforming.  Late Today, Mr. Allen stated he and staff will discuss next steps to bring Town Staff back 
to work in the office.  Plans are to phase in staff and open Town Hall June 1.  The Town is observing 
other local municipalities and the County and is taking safety precautions.  
13.   COUNCIL COMMENTS 
Council Members made general closing comments.

15.   ADJOURN

There shall be two tiers for single-family developed properties based on the amounts of impervious 
surfaces of single-family properties as shown in the following table. 
 
 
 
 
 
2. For other developed residential land, the monthly stormwater service charges shall be one ERC per 
each dwelling unit.  This category includes townhouses, apartments, condominiums and other multi-
unit residential developments. 
 
Tier 
Residential Rate 
Tier 1: ≤ 2,060 sq. ft. 
$4.43 per parcel per month 
Tier 2: > 2,060 sq. ft. 
$5.30 per parcel per month 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 51
3. For all other developed properties, the monthly stormwater service charge on developed land is 
calculated by dividing the total impervious surface area of the property by one (1) ERU, rounded to 
the nearest tenth, multiplied by the established monthly ERU rate (as shown below): 
 
 
 
 
4. The following exemptions from stormwater management service charges are allowed if requests for 
exemptions authorized under subsections (4) and (5) are made in writing to the Town Manager or 
his designee and document the application of the exemption.  The Town Manager may approve or 
reject the request in whole or in part. 
 
i. Undeveloped land 
 
ii. Improved public transportation ways, including public streets, roads, greenways and trails, 
airport taxiways and runways and internal roads within public facilities which have been 
conveyed to the North Carolina Department of Transportation or Town of Indian Trail and which 
are used by the general public for motor vehicle transportation. 
 
iii. Railroad tracks. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings or other developed land shall 
not be exempted from stormwater management service charges. 
 
iv. Developed land with less than four hundred (400) square feet of impervious surface area. 
 
v. Cemeteries, excluding buildings located on cemetery property greater or equal to four hundred 
(400) square feet of impervious surface area.  Churches with attached graveyards shall not be 
included in this exemption. 
Section 60.10 - Billing Method, Responsible Parties, Collection 
 
A. The Stormwater Utility Fee shall be billed on an annual basis and shall be due and payable within the 
time and manner prescribed by law for Town ad valorem taxes (NCGS 105-360).  The Town of Indian 
Trail Tax Collector shall bill and collect the annual Stormwater Fee established herein in the same 
manner as Town taxes are collected and shall include the Stormwater Fee as one (1) or more line items 
on the tax bills mailed to each owner of the property subject to the Stormwater Fee. 
 
B. The property owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater service charge for property 
for which the party billed has not paid the stormwater management service charge. 
 
C. Stormwater utility fees shall be past due after January 5th each calendar year.  Said past due amounts 
shall bear the same rate of interest as unpaid past due property tax.  Unpaid past due stormwater utility 
bills shall become a lien against the real property and may be collected by civil action in the nature of 
foreclosure in the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for Union County, North Carolina.  
In any legal action for collection of past due unpaid stormwater utility bills, the attorney’s fees for the 
Town shall be taxed against the customer or consumer as a part of the judgment. 
ERU 
Non-Residential Rate 
ERU = 2,060 sq. ft. of impervious area

for the person pursuing an adjustment shall be made by refund of the amount affected. 
 
B. Credits 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 53
1. The Town may provide a system of credits to reduce stormwater service charges for properties on 
which stormwater control measures substantially mitigate the peak discharge or runoff pollution 
flowing from such properties or substantially decrease the Town’s cost of maintaining the stormwater 
management system.  The Town Manager or his designee will develop written policies to implement 
the credit system and codify said policies.  No credit will be authorized until the Town Council 
approves written policies to implement the system of credits; a copy of the approved policies shall 
be on file with the Town Clerk.  The Town’s policies may make credits retroactive to the date 
stormwater management service charges were initiated but not to exceed one (1) year.  Any bill 
charges requiring adjustments must be applied through the utility billing system.  But no credit will 
be granted for more than one (1) past year.  Nothing shall prevent the Town Council from modifying 
the adopted system of credits and such modifications may apply to holders of existing credits. 
 
2. Each credit allowed against the stormwater management service charge is conditioned on the 
continuing proper operation, maintenance and functioning of the stormwater control measure as 
designed; credited stormwater control measures must comply with all applicable laws, ordinance and 
regulations, and credits may be rescinded for noncompliance with these standards. 
 
3. Each credit for which a customer applies shall be subject to review and approval by the Director of 
Engineering or his designee.  The Director of Engineering may approve or reject any application for 
a credit in whole or in part. 
 
4. Credits shall only be applied to developed lands containing the credited stormwater control measure.  
For developments with common property containing credited stormwater control measures such as 
townhouse developments, cluster unit developments or condominiums, each dwelling unit shall be 
eligible for its equal pro rata share of the credit unless other arrangements for billing the stormwater 
service charge are made. 
 
Section 60.12 - Limitations of Responsibility 
 
A. The Town shall be responsible only for the portions of the drainage system that are in Town-maintained 
street rights-of-way and permanent storm drainage easements conveyed to and accepted by the Town.  
Repairs and improvements to the drainage system shall be in accordance with established standards, 
policies and schedules. 
 
B. The Town’s acquisition of storm drainage easements and/or the construction or repair by the Town of 
drainage facilities does not constitute a warranty against stormwater hazards, including, but not limited 
to, flooding, erosion or standing water.

Mowing on NCDOT Rights of Way   
                    
 
 
Council Member Barber requested that this issue be placed on the agenda for Council discussion and 
consideration.   As you are aware, NCDOT typically only mows its rights of way 5 times per year.   Because 
of the financial crisis they are facing, they have currently suspended mowing as one of the cost saving 
measures they have taken.   They originally advised they would resume mowing in July, but this is not a 
certainty.  
The Town has received complaints about some of the DOT streets in town, and the high grass along the 
roads and sidewalks.   As you might expect, most citizens do not know which streets are the responsibility 
of the Town, and which streets are the responsibility of DOT.   Mr. Barber had inquired if the Town could step 
in and do this since DOT is not performing this work.   The short answer is yes, the Town can do this if the 
Town Council elects to do so.   Adam has advised me that the Town used to mow three NCDOT roads within 
the Town limits- Indian Trail Road, Unionville-Indian Trail Road, and Rogers Road.   This was discontinued 
two or three years ago by the previous town manager.   
This is a policy matter, and town staff will implement any decision you make regarding this.   I would 
recommend that if you elect to take over this additional responsibility that you permit us to fill one of the two 
frozen positions in the Public Works Department.   The Department has a full workload, and filling this 
position would enable our staff to take on this mowing.

Stormwater/Flooding Issues  
                    
 
As you are aware, this area received very heavy amounts of rainfall between May 18 and May 29.   Rainfall 
totals for this period were approximately 11 inches, with over 3 inches of rain falling between May 27 and 
May 28.   This resulted in widespread flooding in many neighborhoods within the Town.   Adam McLamb and 
Todd Huntsinger have looked at many of these areas, and the Engineering Department has prepared a 
spreadsheet showing these areas.   Public Works and Engineering have already begun to make an initial 
assessment of these areas to see what course of action may be required.    
Some of these areas may just need repairs to the existing stormwater infrastructure, while others will need 
more detailed engineering studies to see how these problems can be ameliorated.   As you know, the Town 
has an existing list of needed stormwater projects, most of which are smaller projects that are typically 
completed in house.  Because of staff size, Adam and I have discussed that the Town may want to consider 
budgeting more funds for contract projects so that these can be completed earlier.   Not counting the Indian 
Trail Park and First Avenue Phase I projects, the proposed budget for FY 20-21 has an appropriation of 
$275,000 for contract stormwater projects.   It’s possible that after any new projects are added to the list, and 
the list is prioritized the Town may identify additional projects that need to be completed in a shorter period 
of time.   If that turns out to be the case, then budget amendment can be approved that would provide more 
funding utilizing fund balance in the Stormwater Fund. 
Fortunately, the Town does have good reserves in this fund, and you collect approximately $1.5 million in 
stormwater fees annually.   However, we have been seeing extreme weather patterns for a number of years, 
and I would anticipate that these extreme conditions will continue, thus necessitating continuing 
investments in stormwater projects.

TOWN OF INDIAN TRAIL 
STORMWATER SERVICE REQUEST 
SUMMARY REPORT 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
This report is to provide Town Council a summarization of all the stormwater service requests that staff 
received during the recent tropic storm event (Bertha) during the period of May 18th – May 31st.  Between 
that time, the Town experience repetitive storm events.  If you take in account the full two weeks of rainfall 
it equates to just over a 50-year storm, or a 2% probability of that much rainfall over a 10-day period in any 
given year.  Due to the frequency of these storms, the soils in Town had saturated to a point where no 
infiltration was occurring which caused some property owners to witness creek beds over flowing and some 
others to see over several inches of surface water flowing across their properties.  The following rainfall 
data was gathered by the Town’s digital rain gauge located at Town Hall:

Due to this unusual demand for services, Engineering was directed to write up a summary of the requests 
and to provide an evaluation on how to move forward in helping our citizens.  The following pages provide a 
brief description of each request and staff’s recommendation on possible solutions.  A visual image of the 
areas in question is also provided.  
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 63
FORBISHIRE DRIVE (Drainage Ditch Behind Brookhaven lots) 
A creek exists along the back of lots adjacent to Forbishire Drive in the Brookhaven subdivision.  The creek 
meanders between HOA common open space and citizen’s properties.  The creek was cleared of trees and 
other potential obstacles that could cause stormwater to back up as part of the Town’s yearly storm water 
maintenance contract just recently. The cleanup included removal of fallen trees and debris.  Unfortunately, 
the consecutive days of rains the Town has recently received call about additional trees falling into the 
creek. 
The creek behind the homes was channel cleaned 4 to 5 years ago to address stormwater complaints. No 
service requests have been received by the Town since this work was completed. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  The fallen trees will be removed, and the channel will be inspected by staff to see if any 
further remediation efforts are warranted.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 64
SOUTH CATAWBA CIRCLE (Cul-De-Sac Flooding) 
The Town received one report regarding flooding in the South Catawba Circle cul-de-sac.  ITPW has been 
working on cleaning and regrading roadway ditches throughout this subdivision for the past few months. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  Public works had already plan to create a better drainage ditch from the cul-de-sac to the 
creek that runs along the back of the properties.  Public works believes that when work is completed it will 
alleviate the issue. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 65
POPLAR GLEN DRIVE  
Flooding is occurring behind the properties on the north side of Poplar Glen Drive. There is currently a 
drainage ditch in place to divert stormwater to the floodplain that runs through the subdivision. The drainage 
ditch has barely contained the stormwater it receives over the past few years and has become significantly 
worse during the previous storms. This drainage ditch was cleaned out last year, but due to lack of 
elevations, could not be deepened to handle more volume.  The Town has recently received several 
complaints regarding this area and several reports of stormwater reaching sheds, garages, and foundations. 
There are also two roadway drainage pipes along Poplar Glen drive that releases runoff behind 5130 Poplar 
Glen Dr. and have caused severe flood concerns for the property owner. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  The Town is pursuing a proposal from our on-call stormwater firm to conduct a drainage 
analysis to gather data about the amount of storm water passing through this community. This will allow the 
Town to determine if the drainage swales are adequately sized and/or if it’s just downstream issues that 
need to be addressed by other agencies.  
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 66
GROVER MOORE PLACE (INDIAN TRAIL PARK SUBDIVISION) 
Flooding is occurring in the backyards of several properties due to Brandon Oaks lots being at a higher 
elevation than theirs. 
These lots will always experience drainage coming off Brandon Oaks lots. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  The Town has a stormwater project in place to help assist with the flows coming off 
Brandon Oaks’ street right-of-way and upstream properties outside Indian Trail Park Subdivision.  This 
project will rechannelize the existing flow patterns that occur in three locations, but it will not alleviate every 
single backyard drainage problem along Grover Moore Place that some homeowners may or may not be 
experiencing during high rain volumes. 
       
 
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 67
FIRST AVENUE 
Severe flooding has been on going throughout the roadway. Front and backyards of several properties 
receive significant stormwater during rainfall events. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  The Town has a funded stormwater project to help alleviate this flooding.  
       
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 68
OAKSTONE SUBDIVISION 
A single property owner at the end of Oakstone Drive has reached out to the Town to request assistance to 
repair a creek that runs behind the property and causes flooding in the backyard. The creek is located on 
the property plat and is also labeled as a creek on the USGS map.  
The same property owner requested this about two years ago. The Town believed that because this creek is 
on the USGS there was a strong possibility it may be a jurisdictional wetland. The Town therefore hired a 
consultant to determine if this was a wetland. It was found that this creek is categorically a wetland. It was 
decided not to pursue this due to the overall cost (permitting, mitigation, construction, etc.), and the fact that 
the homeowner isn’t experiencing any structural flooding. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  Town will continue to monitor creek annually which is what the homeowner was told two 
years ago.  
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 69
ELK WAY (DEERSTYNE SUBDIVISION) 
There is a drainage inlet box between 3703 and 3701 Elk Way that isn’t capturing all the runoff in an 
efficient manner. The offsite runoff is considered private water. 
A similar request was submitted to the Town in March 2019.  Staff visited the site then and informed the 
homeowners there was not anything the Town could do to repair the private storm line. Staff did talk with the 
upstream property owner and he seemed willing to assist, but the citizen who made the request decided not 
to follow thru.  There is currently insufficient space between the homes and the drain inlet to construct a 
storm swale to adequately convey runoff to the drain inlet.   
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  For homeowners to discuss solution with upstream property owner.  A swale or berm on 
the upstream private property to divert flow is a possible solution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 70
KEOWEE CIRCLE 
Owner states stormwater pipes were repaired back in 2018 throughout the community. Since that time water 
has been ponding between four to six inches within the drainage ditch that runs between 128 Keowee Circle 
and 130 Keowee Circle up to four to six inches. Storm water is flooding beneath the house and sheds. 
The Town did clean out the roadway storm pipes, but the pipe that causing the flooding was installed by the 
previous homeowner.  The drainage ditch that conveys the road runoff between the houses was piped in 
and now the pipe is clogged up. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  The Town could remove the pipe and reestablish ditch but would have to get a sign off 
from the property owner for liability purposes.  The Town has no way of knowing how the pipe was installed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 71
PROVIDENCE HILLS DRIVE 
A creek runs under Providence Hills Drive adjacent to homeowners. The two homeowners living adjacent to 
the Creek have raised concerns with the Town. One is worried the creek is eroding their property. Another 
one noticed that when a cleaning crew came to clear the creek the crew left the debris in place and is 
concerned that the debris can clog culvert during the next storm. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  Public Works is getting the debris that was left unintentionally, and creek channel will be 
monitored. 
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 72
RED BARN TRAIL 
Twelve Mile Creek flows near their property. The owner says that the creek is severely flooding due to 
recently cleared area for recently installed power poles. He also noticed an intermittent creek behind his 
house that separates his property from the new Courtyard at Chestnut development (Town of Stallings) has 
also been overflowing. The creek behind his house appears to be connected to the same creek that is being 
reported from Brookhaven. 
Most, if not all the area in question is in the floodplain.  
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  TBD

SECREST SHORT CUT (adjacent to Arbor Glens Subdivision) 
The pipe culvert crossing’s inlet along Secrest Shortcut and the perpendicular creek upstream from it, is 
clogged up with beaver dams. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  Staff is working on getting a company out there to relocate them

UNION GROVE SUBDIVISION (near Faith Church Road) 
A pipe culvert just outside of the Union Grove Subdivision crossing Unionville Indian Trail Road is always 
flooding during rain events. The caller believes the drain may be clogged with debris and has reported the 
drain is often covered in debris. 
This is a known area in Town along NCDOT right-of-way.  Staff will continue to monitor and clean debris 
when it can.   
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  NCDOT upsize the existing culvert crossing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-9-20 Agenda Package   Page 75
COTTAGE CREEK ROAD 
Backyard and neighbor's yard floods regularly since construction has increased on HWY 74. Shed and tools 
in shed have been damaged. Mentions a storm water drain not being dug deep enough. 
 
 
 
Possible Solution:  There is none.  The property owner’s entire backyard is in the floodplain/floodway. 
 
 
 
ADDITIONAL STORMWATER SERVICE REQUESTS 
The Town did receive other requests that were determined by staff to be minor in nature and 
will either be taking care of by Town forces or will be designated as “Does Not Qualify” (DNQ) 
and the owner will be notified as to that determination.  The following is a list of these minor 
request: 
 
1) 418 Carlisle Drive 
2) 8109 Lighthouse Way 
3) 1015 Potomac Road 
4) 3037 Proverbs Court 
5) 2301 Chestnut Lane 
6) 1014 Council Fire Circle 
7) 6407 Howey Bottoms

Old Monroe Road ROW Acquisition  
                    
 
During the May 26 meeting of Town Council there was considerable discussion surrounding the financial 
crisis that has enveloped NCDOT, and the cost cutting measures they have instituted.   Among these is the 
temporary suspension of right of way acquisition for future roadway projects, which has affected the Old 
Monroe Road and Chestnut Parkway Phase II projects.   I suspect that we will get more clarity in the next few 
months regarding DOT’s situation, and for how long this acquisition will be delayed.   
However, one issue that came up was how the Town planned to fund its $5 million share of the ROW 
acquisition.   As you recall, we paid $1 million in April, with half coming from the Debt Service/Capital 
Reserve Fund, and half coming from the $10 million bond authorization.  The next payment is not due until 
July 2021, with no payment required in FY 20-21.    
The decision on how to pay for the remaining $4 million is not one that needs to be made immediately, but 
will need to be made prior to November 2021, when the bond authorization expires.  In order to start the 
conversation regarding how the Town should pay this remaining cost, Jim Wojtowicz has prepared the 
enclosed memo providing three suggested options to consider.   These range from drawing the entire 
amount from the bond authorization to paying the entire cost out of the Town’s operating funds.    
I definitely would not recommend paying the entire amount out of operating funds because I think this would 
limit your flexibility in carrying out smaller (non bond) capital projects that may arise in the next few years.  It 
may make sense, however, to consider paying this part from bond proceeds and part from operating funds 
since this would decrease the amount of interest that you will pay.  If there are other capital projects you 
may want to consider then you may want to draw down the entire amount from the authorization. 
However, I do not recommend that you make any decision on this at the present time, but would suggest you 
revisit this issue during budget discussions next spring.
