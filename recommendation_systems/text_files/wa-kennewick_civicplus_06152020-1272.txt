PUBLIC HEARINGS 
 
 
Vice Chairman Morris opened the public hearing at 6:35 p.m. for Change of Zone (COZ) 
#20-01 proposing to change the zoning district approximately 4.19 acres located 
at 2652 W. 15th Ave from Residential, Manufactured Home (RMH) to Residential, 
High Density (RH).  Applicant is William McKay, 3516 W. 46th Ave, Kennewick, WA 
99337. Owner is Udderly Williams, LLC, 3616 W. 46th Ave, Kennewick, WA 99337. 
 
Mr. Muai said prior to giving report, the Planning Department received an email comment letter 
(entered into record as Exhibit 6. There was a brief pause while the Planning Commissioners 
read the email).  Mr. Muai gave a brief overview of the staff report, and presented a Power Point 
of the staff report; Mr. Muai said there is an approved mini-storage unit for this site, it is currently 
legal non-conforming.  The phases will need to be built-out one right after the other to avoid 
expiration of the existing SPA.  Staff recommends that the Planning Commission concur with 
March 2, 2020 Planning Commission Meeting 
Page 2 of 5 
the Findings and Conditions of the staff report COZ 20-01, and recommend to City Council 
approval of the request. 
 
Planning Commission questions: Was the site plan approval permit that is going to expire 
soon to build mini-storages; if the rezone isn’t approved, will they be prohibited from building the 
mini-storages. 
 
Testimony of Applicant/Applicant’s Representative:  
 
Will McKay 
3516 W 46th Avenue  
Kennewick 99337 
 
Here today representing my father; he owns 27th Avenue mini storage; he is trying to 
accomplish this zone change because the phases can take 5-30 years for build-out, there are 
six phases in project. 
 
Testimony in favor: None 
 
Testimony neutral or against:   
 
Tom Wilson 
1634 S. Dennis Pl. 
Kennewick 99337 
 
The hearing notice only showed up at 1 of 32 houses; have nothing against storage units, why 
is weird stuff in this zoning district, instead of having something that actually talks about x 
amount of years to build; don’t want apartments or people walking through neighborhood, wants 
storage units; why doesn’t code say something plain about storage units, hope he doesn’t build 
apartments. 
 
Timara Morley 
1308 S. Conway St 
Kennewick 99337 
 
It was my email that you received, didn’t understand what was being reviewed; concerned about 
how long construction happening right next door; land cleared mostly vegetation and multiple 
tumble weeds, concerned about how long phases to last and what measures to ensure about 
dust, etc. 
 
Jeff Hoener 
1606 S. Dennis St. 
Kennewick 99337 
 
President of Canyon Pines Homeowners Association; echo Ms. Morley, Conway and other turns 
can be tight with traffic, not interested in high density multi-family there, streets cannot handle it; 
thought this was settled in August of 2019, in favor of mini-storages, plan on using the built out 
mini-storage, not in favor of multi-family residential. 
 
Staff final comments:  Clarify that construction dust control is Benton Clean Air Agency, and 
developers must take measures for dust control, watering, hydro-seed, etc.  Those plans are 
March 2, 2020 Planning Commission Meeting 
Page 3 of 5 
required during construction permit. The high level zoning code is that written that way because 
otherwise we would have to create a zone for every separate use, for everything, it’s too much, 
most things are consolidated into certain zones; The applicant has grandfathered application; in 
order to change the zoning had to change the land use designation, some jurisdictions combine 
those together, trying to match what was done in October to be consistent with comprehensive 
plan.

2020 Comprehensive Plan Amendment Docket Review 
 
STAFF REPORT 
2020 Comprehensive Plan Amendment Docket Review 
Staff Contact: Steve Donovan, AICP 
To:  Planning Commission 
Date:  June 15, 2020 
 
BACKGROUND 
Annually the City opens up the Comprehensive Plan for modification amendments (Land Use) as provided for by 
the Washington State Planning Laws. Amendment requests can be made by the public at large as well as the 
City.  The major purpose is to keep the Comprehensive Plan current and up to date, by reviewing and adopting 
“proper amendments” designed to implement the City of Kennewick’s Comprehensive Plan. 
 
The City accepts amendment applications from March 1st through May 1st each year.  Once the applications have 
been received the Planning Commission will make a recommendation to the City Council who will then make a 
legislative judgment as to whether they will review, defer (set aside for future review) or reject them prior to 
starting a formal review process. 
 
The Washington State Growth Management Act specifies that the City’s annual review is permissive and the 
Council has the right to choose whether or not to initiate a review process for specific proposals as submitted. 
The basic reason why the Council has the right to select or reject requests is by law the legislative bodies  of 
each City or County in the State of Washington are responsible for keeping their plans up to date while 
maintaining the integrity of the Comprehensive Plan. 
 
This means that annually, the City Council must use its legislative judgment as stewards of the City of 
Kennewick’s Comprehensive Plan to determine whether to act on specific amendment requests put before 
them.  
 
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING AMENDMENTS 
In order to make a recommendation on amendment application requests, the following criteria outlined in the 
Kennewick Municipal Code 4.12.110 has been established and should be considered. 
  
1. Timing of the requested amendment is appropriate and Council will have sufficient information to make 
an informed decision; 
2. The City will be able to conduct sufficient analysis, develop policy and related development regulations; 
3. The requested amendment has not been recently rejected by Council; 
4. The amendment will further implement the intent of the City’s adopted Comprehensive Plan; and  
5. The amendment is not better addressed through another planning process such as a sub-area plan 
update. 
 
2020 AMENDMENT REQUESTS - To assist during your deliberations on the legislative amendment requests 
please find below basic information pertinent to each application. Also see attached a Comprehensive Plan Map 
which identifies the location of each requested amendment.

Additionally, it will help implement the following comp plan goals: Housing Goal 1: Support and develop a variety 
of housing types and densities to meet the diverse need of the population and Housing Goal 3: Promote 
affordable housing for all economic segments of the community. 
 
Is the amendment better addressed through another planning process such as a sub-area plan update? 
No. 
 
Staff Conclusions  
The proposed amendment will amend the land use designations of four parcels to be the same as residential 
properties to the east. The amendment is the first step in being able to provide additional residential properties 
for future growth. The proposed change has the potential of increasing the variety of housing types in the area.

AMENDMENT REQUEST – CPA 20-08: Comprehensive Plan amendment to change the land use designation of 
26.42 acres from INDUSTRIAL (I) to MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR). Address: 109 S Oak Street, 1721 E 
3rd Avenue and 50 S Verbena Street.

informed decision? 
There is no issue with the timing of this request.  There is sufficient information for Council to make an informed

develop any new policies or development regulations as a result of this request. 
 
Has the requested amendment been recently rejected by Council? 
No. 
 
Will the amendment further implement the intent of the City’s adopted Comprehensive Plan? 
No, in that the comprehensive plan identifies a shortage of Industrial land to fill Kennewick’s 20-year needs. This 
proposal increase that deficit. 
 
Is the amendment better addressed through another planning process such as a sub-area plan update? 
No. 
 
Staff Conclusions  
The site is in close proximity to the City of Kennewick’s Waste Water Treatment Facility and will be directly 
adjacent to a proposed waste drying facility. Neither of those uses are desirable to have next to residential 
properties. Attached to this report are comments from Kennewick Public Works Department, expressing 
concern with the proposal. Additionally, the removal of the site’s Industrial Land Use Designation will increase 
the deficit the City has for Industrial designated lands.

Subject: RE: Comp Plan Amendment
 
Greg,
 
Utility Services has reviewed the location of the proposed Comprehensive Plan Amendment
changing properties East of the Wastewater Treatment Plant from Industrial to Medium Density
Residential.  The subject properties are adjacent to City owned property reserved for future
expansions of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The City is currently working on a phased approach
to address odor concerns with the existing Wastewater Treatment Plant lagoon system.  Although
these plans will help address odors, future plant expansion to the east will likely increase noise to
these adjacent properties.  Rezoning to residential would be less compatible with existing use and
future expansion of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Importance: High
 
Good morning Cary:
 
As you know we are starting to process our annual comprehensive plan amendments; as
we discussed on the phone last week we have a request to change land currently zoned
Industrial to Medium Density Residential in order to locate a manufactured home park
(aerial attached). The property in question is currently owned by the Port of Kennewick and
is located immediately east of the City’s Waste Water Treatment plant. I’m requesting a
response from the Public Works perspective and the long-term significance of locating
more residential uses at this location. If you would be able to provide something by the end
of next week (5/22) it would be greatly appreciated.
 
Planning staff’s recommendation will be not to place this request on the docket for
processing. Please let me know if you have questions or need additional information.
 
Thanks,
Greg.
