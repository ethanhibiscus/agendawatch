SUMMARY OF REQUEST (GENERAL DESCRiPTiON, FINANCING, OTHER OPERATIONAL IMPACT, POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES)
Staff requests the Board of Public works amend the contract with DLZ to include engineering se^/jces
for the water main on Memorial Drive between Weber & Peterson Roads (Phase IV), and amend the
agreement with DLZ accordingly.
This section of water main, not part of the Channel Crossing engineering, is necessary to connect the
Channel Crossing into the Regional Water System. The engineering work necessary includes final
design and construction engineering. Previously, the Water Policy Board hired J&A (now DLZ) to
perform design work on this section in conjunction with Laketon Township's sewer project; therefore,
most of the design work is complete. The County could "bid" this additional work but since DLZ has
already completed much of the design, other firms would not be financially competitive.
Coordination of Phase IV with Phase III is critical and best accomplished by using the same engineer,
DLZ.
Section 7(c), page 16 of the Amended and Restated Muskegon County Regional Water System
Management Contract states, HAff plans and specifications for the expansions, extensions,
improvements and changes to the System shall be prepared by engineers selected by or acceptable
to the System Policy Board..." The Regional Water System Policy Board approved this amendment
at its June 3, 2020 meeting.
Attached is the proposal from DLZ to perform engineering services for Phase IV for $71 ,900. Staff
requests the Board of Public Works approve amendment #2 to the contract with DLZ to include
Phase IV engineering services.
SUGGESTED MOTION (STATE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD APPEAR IN THE MINUTES)
Move to amend the contract with DLZ to include engineering services for Phase IV of the Channel
Crossing project for a not-to-exceed cost of $71,900 and authorize the Chair to sign amendment #2.

Re: Proposal for Professional Engineering Services for Muskegon County Regional Water System
Memorial Drive from Weber Road to Peterson Road
Dear: Mr. Farrar:
DLZ is pleased to submit this proposal for professional engineering and surveying services to the Muskegon
County Department of Public Works (COUNTY) in connection with proposed water system improvements along
Memoria! Drive from Weber Road to Peterson Road.
BACKGROUND
DLZ's understanding of the project is based on discussions with COUNTY staff; Laketon Township staff and
historical work in the area. The scope of the project consists of construction of approximately 2/600 lineal feet
of water main by open cut methods along Memorial Drive from a connection point at Weber Road and
extending to Peterson Road. The proposed water main segment would be part of the Muskegon Channel
Crossing project that is being constructed to provide a redundant feed from the City of Muskegon Water
Filtration Plant to the COUNTY Northside Regional Water System.
The proposed water main will be designed in accordance with the Recommended Standards for Water Works
(Ten States Standards), the COUNTY Regional Water System Standard Specifications and applicable Michigan
Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy (EGLE) requirements.
SCOPE OF SERVICES
The water main improvements will generally consist of the construction of approximately 2,600 lineal feet of
water main and appurtenances within the Memorial Drive right-of-way from near Weber Road to Peterson
Road. It is anticipated construction of the water main improvements will commence in Spring 2021. The
following agreement between DLZ and the COUNTY is separate and distinct from any other agreement
between DLZ and the COUNTY.
DESIGN ENGINEERING SERVICES
•
 DLZ will meet with COUNTY staff to verify the scope of the project and to gather input on the proposed
water main extension. The sizing of the proposed water main extension wi![ generally follow preliminary
COUNTY Master Planning, EGLE criteria, zoning and industry standards.

SUMMARY OF REQUEST (GENERAL DESCRIPTION, FINANCING, OTHER OPERATIONAL IMPACT, POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES)
Last month the Board voted to reject the one proposal that resulted from RFP 20-2380, Futures
Commodity Brokerage for Corn and Soybean Hedging, because the transaction fees of the firm that
submitted the proposal were 68% higher than the fees of our current brokerage firm, R.J. O'Brien.
For many years, the Wastewater Department had used the brokerage firm Morgan Stanley for
hedging. When Morgan Stanley divested itself of all government accounts in 2019, the Department
out of necessity had to quickly find a replacement vendor and ended up selecting R.J. O'Brien. The
initial plan was to use R.J. O'Brien for one year and then formally solicit proposals to find a firm with
which we would establish a longer-term contract. The one year cost was less than $3,500, therefore
not requiring the need for additional quotes. Now, having used RJ. O'Brien for one year and having
rejected the one proposal from RFP 20-2380 on the basis of cost, the Department now requests the
Board's permission to continue to use R.J. O'Brien for an additional year before establishing a
longer-term contract with a brokerage firm through another formal RFP solicitation.
SUGGESTED MOTION (STATE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD APPEAR IN THE MINUTES)
Move to authorize the Wastewater Department to continue using R.J. O'Brien for one year for
hedging corn and soybeans.

SUMMARY OF REQUEST (GENERAL DESCRIPTION, FINANCING, OTHER OPERATIONAL IMPACT, POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES)
The Wastewater Department requests permission to replace two articulated tractors (6 years old) in
our Agricultural Equipment Rollover Program through Sourcewell, which offers a 24% discount
compared to a 23% discount through MIDeaI.
The tractors are both John Deere model 9520RX priced at $510,956.36 each. in the Agricultural
Equipment Rollover Program, new equipment is purchased with the trade-in of the corresponding old
equipment. The trade-in value of our articulated tractors is estimated to be $178,000 per tractor
based on the expected machine hours at the end of summer when the purchase will be made. The
estimated cost of the tractors with traded-in is therefore $332,956.36 each. However, it's possible
that the tractors could bring in a higher price if sold. Therefore the Department requests permission to
either trade in or sell the used tractors, depending on which option yieids the greater value.
The articulated tractors will be paid for with Wastewater reserve funds and added to the Department's
revised 2020 capital budget.

SUMMARY OF REQUEST (GENERAL DESCRIPTION, FINANCING, OTHER OPERATIONAL IMPACT, POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES)
Quotes were received by the County Procurement Office on May 29,2020, for RFQ 20-2387, Natural
Gas Line Installation, for extending natural gas service from the Wastewater grain center to farm
headquarters. (The quote summary is attached.) The low quote was provided by Miller Pipeline for
$33,565.43. Based on our current prices for natural gas and propane, we estimate the annual
savings from switching to natural gas from propane to be $2,977. The project should pay for itself in
11 years. The Wastewater Department recommends accepting the low quote of $33,565.43 from
Miller Pipeline for the installation of the natural gas line. The project will be paid for from Wastewater
reserve funds and added to the revised FY2020 budget.
SUGGESTED MOTION (STATE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD APPEAR IN THE MINUTES)
Move to accept the low quote from Miller Pipeline for RFQ 20-2387, Natural Gas Line InstaHation, at

SUMMARY OF REQUEST (GENERAL DESCRIPTION, FINANCING, OTHER OPERATIONAL IMPACT, POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES) 
 
The Wastewater Department currently funds two positions with Class WF100, Electrician/WW, pay 
grade WW-00110 ($21.39 - $27.34). We also employ one position with Class WF230, Master 
Electrician/Wastewater, pay grade WW-00130 ($24.45 - $31.29). 
 
When the position Master Electrician/Wastewater becomes vacant, the Department requests to 
make the following changes: 
 
1. Eliminate Class WF230, Master Electrician/Wastewater.   
 
2.  
 
 
 
 
 
These changes will better enable the Department to retain electricians by paying a fair wage to any 
that obtain a master electrician license. By implementing these changes, the savings to the 2021 
Wastewater budget is estimated to be $55,500.      
 
 
SUGGESTED MOTION (STATE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD APPEAR IN THE MINUTES) 
 
Move to defund position W23001, Master Electrician/Wastewater, and to implement the policy of 
promoting employees in Class WF100, Electrician/Wastewater, from pay grade WW-00110 ($21.39 - 
$27.34) to pay grade WW-00130 ($24.45 - $31.29), upon their showing proof of having obtained a 
master electrician license and upon approval by the Department Director, with both of these actions 
taking place upon the retirement of the person currently in the Master Electrician/Wastewater 
position.

The Michigan's Adventure and Evanston Ave. tanks
had their annual cathodic protection system inspections
and everything looked good. DPW received quotes on
washing the Quarterline ground storage tank this
summer.
The design consultant completed evaluation of two
alternates of the best route to proceed north of the
channel thru Muskegon State Park.
Staff continues working with Michigan's Adventure and
their consultants on design plans and EGLE permit

GENERAL ACTIVIES:
Staff continues addressing building needs during the
COVID-19 shutdown. A!l mechanics continue to work
during the closure. Daily walkthroughs in the buildings
are scheduled to look for roof leaks or other problems.

Staff prepared the HOJ/Jail and South Campus areas
for the protest on May 31. Trash cans, ashtrays,
removable signs & bases, picnic tables, etc. were
moved inside or relocated as much as practicable the
morning of May 31. Fortunately, not a single incident of
damage to County property was observed the morning
of June 1. Everything was put back to normal within a
few hours.
Since inmate labor is not available during the COVID-19
shutdown, FM's only groundskeeper, Josh Belinger, did
a great job in May keeping up with grass cutting. All the
rainfall makes it grow too well!

WASTEWATER MONTHLY REPORT
MAY, 2020
^^< IC^t
The Wastewater Department exists to improve the public health of Muskegon County citizens by receiving pollut"
ed wastewater, cleaning it up, and returning it the environment for reuse and enjoyment. We recognize the
weight of our responsibility as stewards both of the environment and of our system infrastructure which enables
us to do our job. Our goal is to offer our service to the people of Muskegon County at the best possible rate
without compromising our stewardships.

FINANCIAL REPORT
Christine IVIorris /Administrative Analyst
APRIL FINANCIAL REPORT
Operating expenses for the first seven months of
the 2020 fiscal year are $7,837/327, or 50% of the
FY2020 budget. Revenues for the same period are
$10,959,392, or 56% of the budget.
FARM REPORT
Ted Costigan / Farm Manager
THE 2020 GROWING SEASON
We had another cold and rainy month in May. Soil
temperatures should be above 50 degrees when
figuring whether it's time to plant or not. This
year's soil temperatures were in the low 40s late
into May. The nighttime temperatures were
unseasonably cool and sometimes freezing. To top
it off, we had multiple rain events that dropped
considerable amounts of water on us and left: us
with saturated soils. Needless to say/ planting was
delayed until conditions were more favorable. We
hope to have planting wrapped up in the first
week of June.The warm temperatures that finally
showed up over Memorial Day weekend have
helped the newly planted fields to germinate
quickly and catch up.
irrigation started on May 4th for the season.
Thankfully we started two weeks earlier than the
last few seasons/ as we received the heavy
rainfalls/ and our lagoons are very full. We will
aggressively run water to try to catch up and get
our lagoon levels back to normal. The three new
irrigation rigs have been installed/ and are
operational. That project wasn't completed as
early as planned due to delays associated with the
Covid-19 outbreak.

SCADA UPGRADE
Kennedy Industries has completed switching over
all but five of our thirteen sewage lift stations to
the new SCADA system. At present they are
waiting on some hardware, the production of
which was slowed up by the COVID-19 shutdown.
During this hiatus they are going back to the
stations that they've already switched over and
working out a few of the bugs.
Anita Friend / Laboratory Supervisor
LABORATORY RENOVATION
Skye Contracting continues to work on a few small
punch list items to complete the lab remodel. One
of these items was the installation of a new
separate exhaust fan for the ICP. Prior to the
installation of the separate exhaust fan, the
exhaust for the ICP was tied into the larger lab
HVAC system. The air flow of the lab HVAC system
is constantly self-adjusting to maintain adequate
flow for the fume hoods. The ICP (which is our
shortened name for the Inductively Coupled
Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer) requires a
stable exhaust flow in order to function properly.
The fluctuating exhaust flow that it experienced
when it was connected to the larger lab HVAC
system caused problems with the instrument's
sensitivity. Now that it's been put on its own
separate exhaust system/ I am happy to report
that the sensitivity has been restored and the
instrument is working great! It's churning out
metals data (i.e., for lead, cadmium, chromium,
etc.) with its usual low detection limits.

SWANSON ROAD IMPROVEMENTS
May began with Jackson-Merkey continuing to
remove unsuitable subgrade material from the
Swanson Road road bed. Later this month they
began adding sand to the road bed and then
aggregate. Paving is expected to begin the first week
of June.
STATISTICAL COMPARISONS
Dave Johnson / Director
FLOWS AND LAGOON LEVELS
The average daily wastewater flow (Fig. 1) received
at the WWTP in May was 20.0 MGD, 18% higher
than the same period last year. (This flow is
indicative of the large rain events that occurred at
the end of April and in mid-May. These rains
contributed to the already high groundwater table
and lake levels. Much l&i, i.e./ Inflow & Infiltration/
has resulted from them.) Hauled waste flow for May
(Fig. 2) was 4.6 MG, 29% lower than the same period
last year. The volume of water in the storage
lagoons (Fig. 3) near the end of May was 4/802 MG,
4.8% higher than it was at this time last year.
