AGENDA SUMMARY REPORT 
 
To: 
 
 
Honorable Mayor and Council Members 
From:  
James Lance, City Attorney 
 
Agenda Title: DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE ADOPTION OF URGENCY ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING 
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE MENDOCINO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH 
OFFICER’S ORDERS PERTAINING TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC 
Type: 
 Presentation 
 Consent 
 Regular Agenda  
 Public Hearing   
 Urgent   Time: 30 MIN 
 
Summary of Request:  The Mendocino County Health Officer, Dr. Noemi Doohan, declared a local 
health emergency on March 4, 2020. The County Health Officer issued a Recommended Shelter- in-
Place Order on March 16, 2020, a Mandatory Shelter-in-Place Order on March 18, 2020, a Revised 
Mandatory Shelter-in-Place Order on March 24, 2020, a Revised Mandatory Shelter-in-Place Order on 
April 24, 2020, and a Revised Mandatory Shelter-in-Place Order dated May 8, 2020 (collectively referred 
to as “Orders”). The Orders require all persons in the County to shelter in place, except to perform 
Essential Activities and operate Essential Businesses, as defined in the Orders. Reports of violations of 
the Orders continue to be received throughout the County, including the City of Willit. 
 
The Mendocino County Board of Supervisors approved an Administrative Penalty Ordinance at its March 
31, 2020 meeting and the City of Ukiah City of Fort Bragg followed suit and approved similar ordinances. 
The ordinances provide that any violation of the COVID-19 related  Health  Officer’s  Orders  is  also  a  
violation  of  a  local  Ordinance  and  therefore allows Code Enforcement to impose administrative 
penalties to any person or business failing to comply with the Orders after receiving notice of non-
compliance. 
 
On May 27, 2020 staff presented the City Council with a proposed ordinance with similar provisions as 
the Ukiah, Ft. Bragg and Mendocino County ordinances. One notable difference is that the proposed City 
of Willits ordinance specifically addresses the issue of Non-Permitted Mass Gatherings. The City Council 
did not adopt the Ordinance and instead table the matter to its next council meeting and directed staff to 
make certain revisions. A revised ordinance, in both clean and marked up form, is presented for City 
Council’s consideration.    
 An Ordinance establishing administrative penalties for violating the Shelter-in-Place Orders merely 
provides the City another tool, if it becomes necessary, and allows the City’s actions to be consistent 
with the County’s policies and practices. 
The revised Ordinance limits the definition of Enforcement Officer to the City Manager, or her designee, 
any peace officer with jurisdiction in the City of Willits and anyone identified by resolution of the City 
Council. 
Urgency Ordinances 
Urgency Ordinances that are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or 
safety, must contain a declaration of the facts constituting the urgency, and 
must be passed by a four-fifths vote of the City Council per Government Code Section 36937. Urgency 
Ordinances go into effect immediately upon adoption per California Government Code Section 36934.  
The proposed Ordinance contains the required findings. 
 
Recommended Action:  City Council upon review may waive the reading of the Ordinance and adopt by 
title only an Urgency Ordinance of the City of Willits establishing  administrative  penalties  for violations 
of the Mendocino County Public Health Officer’s Orders pertaining to 
the 
COVID-19 Pandemic. 
 
Alternative(s):  The City Council may choose to decline to adopt the Urgency Ordinance and/or provide 
other direction to staff. 
Fiscal Impact:   
Although there is no expectation that it will be necessary to levy penalties, any fees collected would partially 
help offset the costs of enforcing the Shelter-in-Place Orders. Costs to enforce the Shelter-in-Place 
Orders are expected to exceed any penalties collected and such efforts will be funded from the General 
Fund.

PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE 
COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER’S COVID-19 
PANDEMIC ORDERS
 
 
 
URGENCY ORDINANCE  
NO. ___-2020 
 
 
 
 
 
WHEREAS, on March 4, 2020, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in 
California due to the threat of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”); and 
 
WHEREAS, on March 4, 2020, the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors and 
Department of Public Health declared a public health emergency in Mendocino County 
due to COVID-19; and  
 
WHEREAS, on March 18, 2020, the Willits City Manager, acting as the Director of 
Emergency Services, declared a local emergency due to COVID-19, which was ratified by 
the City Council at its March 25, 2020 City Council meeting; and 
 
WHEREAS, on March 18, 2020, the Mendocino County Health Official issued a 
Shelter-in-Place Order that prohibits all public and private gatherings of any number of 
people occurring outside a household or living unit except for the limited purposes expressly 
permitted in the Order.  Such Order has subsequently been revised and remains in effect;  
and 
 
WHEREAS, on March 19, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-33-20 
which orders California Residents to stay at home except for certain critical activities. Due 
to directives from federal, state, and local health officers, residents have been advised to 
avoid public gatherings and stay at home to prevent the spread of this disease; and 
 
WHEREAS, on March 31, 2020, the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors adopted 
an urgency ordinance adopting administrative penalties for violations of the County Health 
Officer’s Orders pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic; and  
 
WHEREAS, on April 1, 2020, the City of Ukiah City Council adopted an urgency 
ordinance adopting administrative penalties for violations of the County Health Officer’s 
Orders pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
WHEREAS, on May 11, 2020, the City of Fort Bragg adopted an urgency ordinance 
adopting administrative penalties for violations of the County Health Officer’s Orders 
pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic; and. 
 
2 
 
WHEREAS, under the Governor’s May 25, 2020 guidelines places of worship can reopen 
pending approval from their county public health officials, on the condition that they limit attendance 
to 25% of the building or area’s capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees — whichever is lower. The 
guidelines recite that even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational 
setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a relatively higher risk for 
widespread transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and may result in increased rates of infection, 
hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities 
such as singing and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through six feet of physical 
distancing.  
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Willits City Council ordains as follows: 
Section 1. 
Legislative Findings and Purpose.  The City Council hereby finds as follows: 
 
1. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and Governor Newsom’s state of emergency 
proclamation, on March 12, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20, ordering 
residents to heed any order by local public health Officers, “including but not limited to the 
imposition of social distancing measures, to control the spread of COVID-19.” 
 
2. A violation of the Governor’s Executive Order N-25-20 is a misdemeanor pursuant to 
California Government Code § 8665. 
 
3. A violation of the County Health Officer’s orders made to control the spread of COVID-19, 
including but not limited to the Shelter-in-Place Order that was issued on March 24, 2020, is a 
violation of the Governor’s Executive Order N-25-20. 
 
4. California Health and Safety Code §§ 120275 and 120295 make it a misdemeanor to violate 
certain sections of the Health and Safety Code, including those requiring individuals to comply 
with health orders to facilitate isolation, such as the County Health Officer’s Shelter-in-Place 
Order. 
 
5. Violations of the orders of the County Health Officer related to the control of the spread of 
COVID-19 presents an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety in that they 
increase the likelihood that the COVID-19 virus will spread throughout the County and City in a 
manner that may overwhelm their health care systems and may lead to injury and death that 
might otherwise be substantially reduced through adherence to the orders of the County 
Health Officer. 
 
6. The immediate enforcement of the orders of the County Health Officer is necessary for the 
effective implementation of such orders for the purpose of controlling the spread of COVID-19 
in Mendocino County and the City of Willits. 
 
7. California Government Code § 53069.4 provides authority to the City Council of the City of 
Willits to set administrative penalties for violation of any ordinance enacted by the City Council. 
 
3 
 
8. In order to address the immediate threat to the public peace, health, safety and welfare, this 
Ordinance helps to ensure that the orders of the County Health Officer, issued for the purpose 
of controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus, are followed by providing an administrative 
enforcement mechanism as an alternative to the mechanisms already available. 
 
9. Issuance of administrative penalties provides a significant deterrent to violating the County 
Health Officer’s orders respecting COVID-19, will help promote social distancing through a 
process designed to minimize person-to-person contact. 
 
10. This alternative enforcement mechanism is also designed to provide some relief to law 
enforcement, to enable additional City staff to assist with enforcing the County Health Officer’s 
orders, and to enhance the City’s ability to control the spread of COVID-19. 
 
11. Pursuant to California Government Code § 53069.4, the City Council elects to create an 
administrative penalty and hearing process for the purpose of enforcing the orders of the 
County Health Officer that are issued for the purpose of controlling the spread of the COVID-
19 virus. 
 
12. The potential damage caused by a violation of an order of the County Health Officer 
demands a penalty so as to provide an effective and significant deterrent to violating such 
orders. 
 
13. For violations of the orders of the County Health Officer involving predatory profiteering in a 
declared local emergency, the administrative penalties must be substantial enough to deter 
such practices. 
 
Section 2.  Applicability. 
This ordinance applies from May 27June 10, 2020, until the County Health Officer’s Shelter–in-
Place and the California Governor’s stay at home orders expire or are lifted within the 
incorporated City limits or such additional period of time as declared by City Council resolution. 
 
Section 3.  Authority. 
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the general police power of the City under Cal. Const. 
Art XI § 7 to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, the local emergency declared 
by the City Manager on March 18, 2020 pursuant to Government Code Section 8630 and the

E. If the Responsible Party has not abated, or otherwise repeats the same violation as stated

Council, that does not to exceed $10,000.00;   
 
6

Section 11.  Service Procedures. 
An Administrative Citation may be served on the Responsible Party as follows: 
 
A. Personal service: Personal service may be accomplished without violating the COVID-19 
Orders by setting the Citation documents down near the Responsible Party and stating, in a 
voice loud enough to be heard by the Responsible Party, that the documents are for the 
Responsible Party, if the Responsible Party subsequently either picks up the documents or 
makes an indication that they understand that the documents are intended for them; or 
 
B. Posting and Mailing: Posting and mailing requires both of the following: 
 
1. Posting the Citation on any real property within the City in which the City has 
knowledge that the Responsible Party has a legal interest, or at the location at which 
the violation occurred; posting shall be placed in a position that is likely to catch the 
7 
 
attention of a person entering the property, including but not limited to a front door, gate, 
or near a mailbox; and 
 
2. Mailing the Citation by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address that the 
citation was posted, or to any other mailing address of the Responsible Party that is

least as effective at reaching the Responsible Party, including but not limited to an 
address provided by a Responsible Party in a request for appeal of a Citation; or 
 
C. By Mail: Service by mail may be accomplished by sending the Citation by first class mail, to 
the location that the violation occurred, or to any other mailing address of the Responsible 
Party that is known to the City if the City reasonably believes that such mailing address will be 
at least as effective at reaching the Responsible Party, including but not limited to an address 
provided by a Responsible Party in a request for appeal of a Citation. 
 
D. Service shall be complete at the time of personal service, or forty-eight (48) hours after 
posting and mailing, or five days after service by mail alone. 
 
Section 12.  Procedure to Appeal an Administrative Citation. 
A.  Any recipient of a Citation who is identified as a Responsible Party may contest that he or 
she was responsible for violating the COVID-19 Order as cited by appealing the citation to the 
City. 
 
B. To appeal the Citation, the recipient must give notice to the City within ten (10) days from 
the date of service of the Citation that they are appealing the Citation. The notice to the City 
may be made by providing a document, in writing, which may be transmitted electronically to 
the City Manager at sgsierra@cityofwillits.org bearing the title, “Appeal of Administrative 
Citation,” containing the following: 
 
1. The name, address and phone number of the appellant; and 
 
2. Sufficient information to identify the Citation; and 
 
3. The grounds on which the Citation is being contested; and 
 
4. All information, including copies of any exhibits, that supports the grounds for 
appealing the Citation. 
 
C. Upon receipt of a timely requested appeal, the City will present the matter to the County 
Health Officer, City Manager, or their designee, so that they can make an initial determination 
about whether the appellant violated a COVID-19 Order as stated in the citation being

Section 18.  Urgency Ordinance. 
This Ordinance is hereby declared to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the 
public peace, health, and safety and will take effect and be in force upon its adoption by a four-
fifths (4/5) vote of the members of the Willits City Council. The facts constituting the urgency 
are as follows: 
 
10 
 
1. On March 4, 2020, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in California due to the 
threat of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). On March 18, 2020, the City's Director of 
Emergency Services declared a local emergency due to COVID-19, which was ratified by the 
City Council at its March 25, 2020 Special City Council meeting. Due to directives from federal, 
state, and local health officers, residents have been advised to avoid public gatherings and 
stay at home to prevent the spread of this disease. 
 
2. On March 16, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20. The order mandates 
that residents heed any order by local public health officers, “including but not limited to the 
imposition of social distancing measures, to control the spread of COVID-19.” 
 
3. On March 18, 2020, the Health Officer of the County of Mendocino issued a shelter in place 
order, the violation of which is punishable as a misdemeanor. The Health Officer has since 
issued revisions to that original order, including those dated April 24, 2020 and May 8, 2020 
and May 21, 2020. 
 
4. The purpose of these restrictions on travel and shelter in place orders is to inhibit and 
reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus to protect the health of the City, Mendocino 
County, the State of California and the entire country. 
 
5. Violations of the orders of the County Health Officer related to the control of the spread of 
COVID-19 present an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety in that they 
increase the likelihood that the COVID-19 virus will spread throughout the County and City in a 
manner that may overwhelm our health care systems and may lead to injury and death that 
might otherwise be substantially reduced through adherence to the orders of the County 
Health Officer. 
 
6. The immediate enforcement of the orders of the County Health Officer is necessary for the 
effective implementation of such orders for the purpose of controlling the spread of COVID-19 
in Mendocino County and the City of Willits. 
 
7. It would substantially defeat the purpose of the temporary administrative enforcement 
mechanism for orders of the County Health Officer provided by this Ordinance and endanger 
the health of the community, if the effective date of this Ordinance were delayed to permit 
introduction at one City Council meeting, adoption at a second meeting and a referendum 
period of 30 days following adoption of the Ordinance. 
 
 
Section 19. CEQA Compliance.   
The adoption of this Ordinance is not subject to CEQA pursuant to Sections 15060(c)(2) and 
15061(b)(3) of the State CEQA Guidelines, because it will not result in a direct or reasonably 
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment and because there is no possibility 
that it may have a significant effect on the environment. 
Section 20. Severability. 
   
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance is for any reason held 
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not 
11 
 
affect the validity of the remaining portions of the Ordinance.  The City Council of the City of 
Willits hereby declares that it would have passed this Ordinance and each section, subsection, 
sentence, clause and phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that one or more sections, 
subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases may be held invalid or unconstitutional. 
 
 
The foregoing Urgency Ordinance was introduced by Councilmember 
___________ and adopted at a regular meeting of the City Council of the City of Willits 
held on May 27June 10, 2020 by the following vote: 
 
AYES: 
 
NOES: 
None.  
ABSENT: 
None. 
ABSTAIN: 
None. 
RECUSE: 
None.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Willits City Council ordains as follows: 
Section 1. 
Legislative Findings and Purpose.  The City Council hereby finds as follows: 
 
1. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and Governor Newsom’s state of emergency 
proclamation, on March 12, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20, ordering 
residents to heed any order by local public health Officers, “including but not limited to the 
imposition of social distancing measures, to control the spread of COVID-19.” 
 
2. A violation of the Governor’s Executive Order N-25-20 is a misdemeanor pursuant to 
California Government Code § 8665. 
 
3. A violation of the County Health Officer’s orders made to control the spread of COVID-19, 
including but not limited to the Shelter-in-Place Order that was issued on March 24, 2020, is a 
violation of the Governor’s Executive Order N-25-20. 
 
4. California Health and Safety Code §§ 120275 and 120295 make it a misdemeanor to violate 
certain sections of the Health and Safety Code, including those requiring individuals to comply 
with health orders to facilitate isolation, such as the County Health Officer’s Shelter-in-Place 
Order. 
 
5. Violations of the orders of the County Health Officer related to the control of the spread of 
COVID-19 presents an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety in that they 
increase the likelihood that the COVID-19 virus will spread throughout the County and City in a 
manner that may overwhelm their health care systems and may lead to injury and death that 
might otherwise be substantially reduced through adherence to the orders of the County 
Health Officer. 
 
6. The immediate enforcement of the orders of the County Health Officer is necessary for the 
effective implementation of such orders for the purpose of controlling the spread of COVID-19 
in Mendocino County and the City of Willits. 
 
7. California Government Code § 53069.4 provides authority to the City Council of the City of 
Willits to set administrative penalties for violation of any ordinance enacted by the City Council. 
 
8. In order to address the immediate threat to the public peace, health, safety and welfare, this 
Ordinance helps to ensure that the orders of the County Health Officer, issued for the purpose 
of controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus, are followed by providing an administrative 
enforcement mechanism as an alternative to the mechanisms already available. 
 
9. Issuance of administrative penalties provides a significant deterrent to violating the County 
Health Officer’s orders respecting COVID-19, will help promote social distancing through a 
process designed to minimize person-to-person contact. 
3 
 
 
10. This alternative enforcement mechanism is also designed to provide some relief to law 
enforcement, to enable additional City staff to assist with enforcing the County Health Officer’s 
orders, and to enhance the City’s ability to control the spread of COVID-19. 
 
11. Pursuant to California Government Code § 53069.4, the City Council elects to create an 
administrative penalty and hearing process for the purpose of enforcing the orders of the 
County Health Officer that are issued for the purpose of controlling the spread of the COVID-
19 virus. 
 
12. The potential damage caused by a violation of an order of the County Health Officer 
demands a penalty so as to provide an effective and significant deterrent to violating such 
orders. 
 
13. For violations of the orders of the County Health Officer involving predatory profiteering in a 
declared local emergency, the administrative penalties must be substantial enough to deter 
such practices. 
 
Section 2.  Applicability. 
This ordinance applies from June 10, 2020, until the County Health Officer’s Shelter–in-Place 
and the California Governor’s stay at home orders expire or are lifted within the incorporated 
City limits or such additional period of time as declared by City Council resolution. 
 
Section 3.  Authority. 
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the general police power of the City under Cal. Const. 
Art XI § 7 to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, the local emergency declared 
by the City Manager on March 18, 2020 pursuant to Government Code Section 8630 and the 
Governor's Executive Order N-25-20.

the limitations imposed by the County Health Officer.

later comes into existence, which is issued for the purpose of controlling the spread of the

issued by the Governor of California on March 12, 2020.

All COVID-19 Orders are hereby incorporated into this Ordinance as the law of the City of

Section 7.  Violation and Enforcement. 
A. A violation of a COVID-19 Order shall be a misdemeanor, a public nuisance, and a violation

or criminal in nature. As such, the provisions of this Ordinance may be utilized alone or in 
conjunction with any other remedy at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, temporary 
restraining order and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief. Election to employ one or more 
proceedings provided by this Ordinance shall be at the sole discretion of the City and shall be 
without prejudice to the City choosing to also proceed simultaneously or subsequently by 
pursuing different enforcement proceedings or remedies with respect to the same violation. 
 
Section 9.  Issuance of Notice or Citation; Penalty Amounts. 
A. Each and every day a violation of a COVID-19 Order exists constitutes a separate and 
distinct offense. One or more citations may be issued for each day the violation continues. 
 
5

D. When an Enforcement Officer discovers, or otherwise determines that a violation of a 
COVID-19 Order occurred, such Enforcement Officer may issue a Notice of Violation to the 
Responsible Party that provides twenty-four (24) hours to abate the violation. The decision to 
issue a Notice of Violation rather than a Citation is at the discretion of the Enforcement Officer. 
 
E. If the Responsible Party has not abated, or otherwise repeats the same violation as stated 
in the Notice of Violation, after the passage of twenty-four (24) hours from the service of the 
Notice of Violation, the Enforcement Officer may then issue an Administrative Citation that 
imposes a civil penalty. 
 
F.  With the exception of a violation involving a Non-Compliant Mass Gathering, the civil

as determined by the Enforcement Offer, and as subsequently ratified or adjusted by the City 
Council, that does not exceed $10,000.00;   
 
H. The administrative penalty becomes effective and due immediately upon issuance of the 
Citation. The Responsible Party has ninety (90) days from the date of service of the Citation to 
pay the penalty in the absence of a timely submitted request for an administrative hearing to

Section 11.  Service Procedures. 
An Administrative Citation may be served on the Responsible Party as follows:

Orders by setting the Citation documents down near the Responsible Party and stating, in a

makes an indication that they understand that the documents are intended for them; or 
 
B. Posting and Mailing: Posting and mailing requires both of the following:

reviewing any or all of the associated documents presented by the appellant or the City;

3. If the County Health Officer, City Manager, or designee, determines that a violation 
did not occur, the City will withdraw its citation along with the associated penalty; 
 
4. If the County Health Officer, City Manager, or designee, determines that a violation 
occurred, the City will give notice to the appellant, pursuant to Section 9, of the 
determination along with instructions on how to continue pursuing their appeal, if 
desired. 
 
8 
 
D. If appellant does not submit a timely request to the City for a hearing by a Hearing Officer

Manager, or designee, such determination shall become the final administrative order. 
 
E. If the appellant wishes to have a hearing after determination by the County Health Officer, 
City Manager, or designee, the appellant must provide written notice to the City within ten (10) 
days of service of the notice of the County Health Officer, City Manager, or designee’s

consider all relevant evidence, objections or protests, and shall receive testimony from the 
Responsible Party, witnesses, City staff, and interested persons relative to such violation of a 
COVID-19 order. The hearing may be continued from time to time. The Hearing Officer may 
request additional information from the parties prior to issuing a written decision. The failure of 
any appellant of an Administrative Citation to appear at the scheduled hearing shall constitute 
a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. 
 
Section 14.  Administrative Order. 
A. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall determine whether the 
Responsible Party violated a COVID-19 Order as specified in the Citation being contested, and 
shall state the reasons for that decision in a written order.

otherwise adjusted by the Hearing Officer, shall be immediately due and payable to the City 
upon service of the notice of determination.

dismissed, and the Citation will be deemed withdrawn by the City.

with the timelines and provisions as set forth in California Government Code § 53069.4.

not timely paid, including but not limited to a civil action for collection of civil penalties.

shall be given or served on the Responsible Party in accordance with the provisions of this 
Ordinance. 
 
B. If a notice is required by this Ordinance, including but not limited to a notice of Citation, and 
the notice is properly given or served pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance, the failure to 
receive such notice shall not affect the validity of proceedings conducted pursuant to his 
Ordinance. 
 
Section 18.  Urgency Ordinance. 
This Ordinance is hereby declared to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the 
public peace, health, and safety and will take effect and be in force upon its adoption by a four-
fifths (4/5) vote of the members of the Willits City Council. The facts constituting the urgency 
are as follows: 
 
1. On March 4, 2020, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in California due to the 
threat of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). On March 18, 2020, the City's Director of 
Emergency Services declared a local emergency due to COVID-19, which was ratified by the 
City Council at its March 25, 2020 Special City Council meeting. Due to directives from federal, 
state, and local health officers, residents have been advised to avoid public gatherings and 
stay at home to prevent the spread of this disease. 
 
2. On March 16, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20. The order mandates 
that residents heed any order by local public health officers, “including but not limited to the 
imposition of social distancing measures, to control the spread of COVID-19.” 
 
10 
 
3. On March 18, 2020, the Health Officer of the County of Mendocino issued a shelter in place 
order, the violation of which is punishable as a misdemeanor. The Health Officer has since 
issued revisions to that original order, including those dated April 24, 2020 and May 8, 2020 
and May 21, 2020. 
 
4. The purpose of these restrictions on travel and shelter in place orders is to inhibit and 
reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus to protect the health of the City, Mendocino 
County, the State of California and the entire country. 
 
5. Violations of the orders of the County Health Officer related to the control of the spread of 
COVID-19 present an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety in that they 
increase the likelihood that the COVID-19 virus will spread throughout the County and City in a 
manner that may overwhelm our health care systems and may lead to injury and death that 
might otherwise be substantially reduced through adherence to the orders of the County 
Health Officer. 
 
6. The immediate enforcement of the orders of the County Health Officer is necessary for the 
effective implementation of such orders for the purpose of controlling the spread of COVID-19 
in Mendocino County and the City of Willits. 
 
7. It would substantially defeat the purpose of the temporary administrative enforcement 
mechanism for orders of the County Health Officer provided by this Ordinance and endanger 
the health of the community, if the effective date of this Ordinance were delayed to permit 
introduction at one City Council meeting, adoption at a second meeting and a referendum 
period of 30 days following adoption of the Ordinance. 
 
 
Section 19. CEQA Compliance.   
The adoption of this Ordinance is not subject to CEQA pursuant to Sections 15060(c)(2) and 
15061(b)(3) of the State CEQA Guidelines, because it will not result in a direct or reasonably 
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment and because there is no possibility 
that it may have a significant effect on the environment. 
Section 20. Severability. 
   
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance is for any reason held 
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not 
affect the validity of the remaining portions of the Ordinance.  The City Council of the City of 
Willits hereby declares that it would have passed this Ordinance and each section, subsection, 
sentence, clause and phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that one or more sections, 
subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases may be held invalid or unconstitutional.

Agenda Title: INTRODUCTION AND ADOPTION OF AN URGENCY ORDINANCE MODIFYING 
CHAPTER 2.44 OF THE CITY CODE TO AUTHORIZE THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES 
TO WAIVE ZONING REQUIREMENTS OR STANDARDS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATIONS OF 
BUSINESSES AFFECTED BY THE  NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) 
Type: 
 Presentation   
 Consent   
 Regular Agenda   
 Public Hearing   
 Urgent   Time: 15 min. 
 
Summary of Request: The City Council will consider introducing and adopting an urgency ordinance 
(“Urgency Ordinance”) authorizing the City Manager as Director of Emergency Services to waive zoning 
requirements or standards to facilitate the operations of businesses affected by federal, state, and local 
emergency orders. Upon Council approval the Urgency Ordinance would go into effect immediately.  
 
Background:  In early 2020, the Covid-19 virus outbreak put unprecedented restraints on commercial 
activities across the State of California and beyond. While some businesses activities deemed essential 
were allowed to continue (generally) and others deemed low risk are gradually being able to resume 
activities with mitigations; certain business types such as retail and restaurants, which typically require high 
frequency social interaction, are anticipated to face constraints into the foreseeable future. In response, 
municipalities across the County are looking for options and opportunities to support these business 
operations, while they implement health safety requirements. 
 
The Mendocino County Health Officer, Dr. Noemi Doohan, declared a local health emergency on March 4, 
2020. The County Health Officer issued a Recommended Shelter-in-Place Order on March 16, 2020, and a 
Mandatory Shelter-in-Place Order on March 18, 2020, most recently revised on May 15, 2020. These 
County orders are part of a larger statewide stay-at-home order issued on March 19, 2020 by Governor 
Newsom. 
 
Modifications to the Shelter-in-Place Order are guided by health risk and will take a gradual phased 
approach that includes four stages, referred to as California’s Resilience Roadmap. We are now in Stage 
2.5, where retail, Hair Salons and Barbershops, Restaurants (limited dine-in), dental services, construction,  
manufacturing, office workplaces, limited personal services, outdoor museums, and childcare programs 
can open with modifications. 
 
It is anticipated that most businesses will need to adapt to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Specific modifications to adhere to the Shelter-in-Place Order and Social Distancing requirements will vary 
depending on guidance prepared for specific industries. Businesses that are not anticipated to reopen until 
Stage 3 or Stage 4 may need to reconsider their business model entirely in order to stay economically 
viable. 
 
Regulatory flexibility and streamlining of approval processes could support the implementation of creative 
adaptations of business operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adaptations will likely be industry 
specific, site specific, and differ depending on the proprietor’s approach. For example, restaurants allowed 
to reopen with less capacity may desire to move tables outdoors and request to waive parking 
requirements, or serve meals at an off-site location. Likewise, retail shops may wish to move products 
outdoors or request to waive the maximum sign allowance. 
 
Given these considerations, staff recommends adoption of an ordinance expanding the emergency powers 
of the City Manager, acting as the Director of Emergency Services, to allow for regulatory flexibility with 
expedited approval to promote the survival of local businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as 
during future local emergencies such as a Public Safety Power Shutoff event. 
 
Discussion: The proposed Urgency Ordinance (Attachments 1 & 2, redline and clean versions) authorizes 
the Director of Emergency Services to waive regulatory requirements and standards under the zoning 
provisions of the City Code to facilitate the survival of local businesses that are burdened by federal, state, 
and local emergency orders, provided that this waiver does not lead to the businesses engaging in uses 
that are not suitable and appropriate to the site considering what uses are otherwise allowed in the zoning 
district. The waiver is temporary and will end with the termination of the emergency at the local level.  The 
City may require operational changes or disallow uses based on verified complaints or other health/safety 
or applicable regulatory compliance issues.    
 
The Urgency Ordinance also establishes a procedure for requesting a waiver and appealing denial of that 
waiver. An interested business will submit a temporary zoning permit application, at no cost, directly to the 
Community Development Director. If the Director denies the waiver, the applicant must file an appeal of 
that decision within ten (10) days of the date of the decision. The City Manager will make a decision on the 
appeal within seventy-two (72) hours after the applicant files an appeal. The City Manager’s determination 
can be appealed the City Council whom will make a final decision on the appeal at the next regular or 
special meeting following the issuance of a decision from the City Manager. 
 
If this Urgency Ordinance is approved, staff will develop more detailed parameters to be incorporated in the 
temporary zoning permit requirements.  Any criteria applied will be designed to protect public health and 
safety and to minimize any impacts to the community from changes in business operations.   Staff will 
continue to work closely with businesses and the Willits Chamber of Commerce to ensure that 
implementation of these provisions are simple, streamlined and effective. 
 
 
Recommended Action:  Waive the reading of the Ordinance and adopt by title only an urgency ordinance 
enacting temporary zoning and development entitlement modifications to safely effectuate state and 
regional public health orders in conjunction with recovery and reopening efforts due to the novel 
coronavirus (COVID-19).   
Alternative(s):  The City Council may choose to decline to adopt the Urgency Ordinance and/or provide 
other direction to staff. 
Fiscal Impact:  There is no anticipated direct fiscal impact due to the adoption of this Urgency Ordinance. 
Adoption of the proposed Urgency Ordinance is anticipated to have a positive economic impact to the City 
of Willits by helping to sustain valuable local businesses and support the economic health of the community 
during this emergency.  
Personnel Impact:  Staff time will be required to review temporary zoning permit requests.   Actual staff 
time required will depend on the number and nature of requests received.   
Environmental Determination: This is not a project within the meaning of Section 15378 of the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines pursuant to Public Resource Code section 21080(b)(4) and 
the exception in CEQA Guidelines Section 15269(c).  CEQA Guidelines Section 15269(c) provides that 
projects that require specific actions necessary to mitigate an emergency are exempt from CEQA.

RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF WILLITS APPROVING URGENCY 
ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO WAIVE ZONING 
REQUIREMENTS AND/OR STANDARDS TO FACILITATE BUSINESS OPERATIONS AFFECTED BY

Services, declared a local emergency due to COVID-19, which was ratified by the City Council at its

WHEREAS, the easing of restrictions to health orders is anticipated and a return to business 
operations during COVID-19 will occur in a gradual four-stage phased approach following California’s 
Pandemic Resilience Roadmap; and 
 
WHEREAS, on May 4, 2020 Executive Order N-60-20 directed continued compliance with State

WHEREAS, the Mendocino County Health Officer has filed for attestation with the State of

WHEREAS, businesses will likely need to modify operations to adapt to Social Distancing

WHEREAS, to facilitate the return to business operations, this Urgency Ordinance would 
authorize the Director of Emergency Services or their designee to waive strict application of zoning 
standards and/or regulations to the extent that such waivers would not result in an increase in 
general intensity of use beyond that which is generally allowed; and 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Willits City Council ordains as follows: 
Section 1. Findings. The foregoing recitals are true and correct and are made a part of this ordinance. 
 
Section 2. Municipal Code Amendment. Title 2, Chapter 2.44, Section 2.44.100, subdivision F(7) is 
hereby added to the Willits Municipal Code to read as follows: 
 
2.44.100 POWERS AND DUTIES OF DIRECTOR.

June 10, 2020 
 
 
use beyond what is otherwise allowed, as applicable to the zoning district where the 
use is located.  Such waiver shall expire concurrently with the termination of the local 
emergency pursuant to Section 2.44.130 of this Code. 
 
i. 
A business seeking such a waiver shall provide a temporary zoning permit    
application directly to the Community Development Director. 
 
ii. Appeals of the Community Development Director’s decision as to whether to grant 
a waiver shall be considered by the City Manager.   An appeal must be filed with 
the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the date the decision was made. The City 
Manager shall make a decision with seventy-two (72) hours after the appeal is

waiver shall be filed with the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the date the decision 
was made. The City Council shall make a final decision on the appeal at the next 
regular or special meeting following the City Manager’s decision 
 
 
Section 3. Urgency Finding and Declaration. The City Council finds and declares there is an 
immediate threat to public health, safety and/or welfare and that this Ordinance is hereby declared to be 
necessary and will take effect immediately upon its adoption by a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the members of 
the Willits City Council. The facts constituting the urgency are as follows: 
 
1. On March 4, 2020, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in California due to the threat of 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). On March 17, 2020, the City's Director of Emergency 
Services declared a local emergency due to COVID-19, which was ratified by the City Council at its 
March 24, 2020 Special City Council meeting. Due to directives from federal, state, and local health 
officers, residents have been advised to avoid public gatherings and stay at home to prevent the spread 
of this disease. 
 
2. On March 18, 2020, the Mendocino County Health Official issued a Shelter-in-Place Order, which 
was revised on March 24, 2020, May 8, 2020, and May 15, 2020; and 
 
3. On May 4, 2020 the Governor issued Executive Order N-60-20 directing continued compliance with 
State Public Health Directives, and on May 7, 2020 the State Public Health Officer issued an order 
allowing all local health jurisdictions to begin gradual movement into Stage 2; and 
 
4. The City, County and State economies have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of 
nonessential businesses, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tourism industry in the City of 
Willits is particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts from closure of nonessential businesses and the 
ban on nonessential travel required by the public health orders; and 
5. The specific needs of individual businesses as they return to operations during the COVID-19 
pandemic in a gradual phased approach following California’s Pandemic Resilience Roadmap are an 
unknown. Businesses will likely need to modify operations to adapt to Social Distancing requirements, 
as well as to meet current market demands, and the City desires to be responsive, flexible, and 
accommodating to requests from our local business community, while maintaining the safety and 
wellbeing of the public; an 
 
6.  It would substantially defeat the purpose of this ordinance, if the effective date were delayed to permit 
introduction at one City Council meeting, adoption at a second meeting and a referendum period of 30 
days following adoption of the Ordinance. 
 
Section 19. CEQA Compliance.   
This is not a project within the meaning of Section 15378 of the California Environmental Quality Act 
Resolution No. 2020-__ 
 
June 10, 2020 
 
 
(CEQA) Guidelines pursuant to Public Resource Code section 21080(b)(4) and the exception in CEQA 
Guidelines Section 15269(c).  CEQA Guidelines Section 15269(c) provides that projects that require 
specific actions necessary to mitigate an emergency are exempt from CEQA. 
Section 20. Severability.    
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance is for any reason held by a court 
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the 
remaining portions of the Ordinance.  The City Council of the City of Willits hereby declares that it would 
have passed this Ordinance and each section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase thereof 
irrespective of the fact that one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases may be 
held invalid or unconstitutional. 
 
 
The above and foregoing Resolution was introduced by Councilmember       seconded by 
Councilmember      , and passed and adopted at a regular meeting of the City Council of the City of 
Willits, held on the 10th day of June, 2020, by the following vote:

8A. GENERAL DISCUSSION OF CITY BUSINESS AS IT RELATES TO THE COVID-19 PUBLIC HEATH 
CRISIS 
 
City Manager Garrabrant-Sierra commented that she has spoken with the County Health Officer 
who has expressed her frustration with how she is being criticized that her rules are stricter than 
what the governor is putting out. But her rules are no stricter than those of Governor Newsom. 
The newest SIP Order will be released tomorrow, Thursday, May 28th which will allow for Hair 
Salons and Barbershops to open for limited services with mandatory facial covering by both the 
patron and the stylist; and Places of Worship for limited capacity in person religious services. 
City Manager also asked about tanning bed businesses and nail salons, she was informed, they 
are not allowed to open at this time. The City will post the new SIP on their website and 
Facebook page. With such a small staff and no further resources we do not have the capability 
to translate the new information and the information provided to the city is changing so quickly 
that we cannot get this much information out to all 1,300 business in the Willits area in such a 
short amount of time. Thankfully West Company and Willits Chamber of Commerce also help 
with getting new information out to the businesses. City Manager Garrabrant-Sierra stated we 
are doing what the County and surrounding Cities are doing. Several businesses opened over 
the weekend and this was great to see. Further commenting that the above Urgency Ordinance 
is not aimed at business as much as mass gatherings, such as in-person political protest, which 
will also be included in the new SIP.  
 
The Country currently has 25 COVID-19 cases and feels with the expanded openings we will 
have more. The City Manager encouraged our community to be safe. 
   
Councilmember Kanne thanked the City Manager for her updates and for getting the message 
out to the community. She knows it hard to get this information out, to educate the community, 
and to stay on top of all the changes. Councilmember Kanne asked if we could get back to more 
city related information, not connected to COVID-19, bring the newsletter back would be much 
appreciated. City Manager Garrabrant-Sierra commented she would love to do this and will get 
departments to add a line or two about what’s going on in their worlds.

8B. VERBAL UPDATE REGARDING THE CITY’S CONTRACT WITH NCRM TO EXPLORE A 
CONSERVATION EASEMENT IN THE CITY’S WATERSHED 
North Coast Regional Management (NCRM) Vice President, Todd McMahon gave a brief 
update regarding the Watershed. This project was potentially putting an easement on the 
Watershed were they would bundle up the rights that exist on the easement along with the 
rights the City does not want to exercise and try to sell these rights to a conservation group to 
prevent future right of development. This project consists of five (5) phases, NCRM contracted 
with the City for two (2) of these phases which were to research high conservation values for 
interested conservation groups on the Watershed and to look at what the development rights 
that exist on the Watershed are. Both of these phases have been completed along with 
completing a permitting exercise and researching the zoning for what the allowable uses are. 
They are currently awaiting maps that will be added to the report to be shared with staff and City 
Council.  
 
They have found there are 25 parcels on the Watershed, three (3) different Zoning types and 
they all have different allowable uses, along with the ability to put one (1) residential 
development on each parcel. The City has the potential to sell 25 home sites on the property. 
The next step would be to reach out to conservation groups with the values the City is looking 
for, but due to the state we are all in with Covid, NCRM will be waiting until the economy 
improves. 
Councilmembers thanked Mr. McMahon for this update and knowing where the City stands at 
this time.  
 
Public Comment: None presented. 
 
8C. CITY MANAGER VERBAL REPORTS – NO ACTION 
City Manager Garrabrant-Sierra reported on the following: 
 
Skate Park Update – volunteers are stepping forward to help with overseeing the rules for 
opening the park. These community members are currently in background so that we may 
get the park open very soon. We are grateful these community members have stepped 
forward. 
 
We have completed two (2) days of COVID-19 testing. The more residents that come out 
to test the faster our community will open. The County will be offering testing this weekend 
at the Ukiah Fairgrounds. City Manager Garrabrant-Sierra encourages the community to 
get tested. 
 
Councilmember Strong informed the Council that she has been researching COVID-19 testing 
for our Wastewater System and has received information from Humboldt County about a private 
company that would do the test for about $1,200. Councilmember Strong states she has 
someone who would be willing to pay for the cost if the City would allow for this to be done. 
Therefore, Councilmember Strong is looking for direction from Council as to whether to 
agendaize this for further discussion or to allow City Manager Garrabrant-Sierra to move 
forward. It was agreed that the City Manager will move forward with speaking to Utilities 
Superintendent Scott Herman and contacting Councilmember Strong.

Agenda Title: APPROVE THE PURCHASE OF TWO UPGRADED STAINLESS STEEL FILTER

 Regular Agenda   
 Public Hearing   
 Urgent   Time: N/A 
Summary of Request:  In 2014 the Water Treatment Plant went through a whole plant upgrade, including 
adding a third Trident Filtration unit for redundancy.  These units were fully refurbished and came with new 
clarifier screens made of aluminum.  In May of 2019, one of screens was compromised to the point that it 
needed to be replaced with a new back up screen that was included in the plant upgrade.  Staff has noticed 
the other two Trident units’ screens are starting to see the same degradation as the one that was replaced.  
Staff is asking to replace these aluminum screens with stainless steel for better longevity.  The existing 
aluminum screens have been functional for approximately five years, while the stainless screens have an 
indefinite life span.  The stainless steel screens are meant to be permanent, but can occasionally need 
replacement depending on the character of the water and other factors.  Please see the attached quote in 
the amount of $36,175.57 from Fund 503-5033-4003-004 which was adopted in the FY 19/20 budget.  
This is not subject to the formal bid process because these filter screens are proprietary and not available 
from other vendors.     
Recommended Action:  Approve the request to purchase the upgraded stainless steel filter screens in the 
amount of $36,175.57 from Fund 503-5033-4003-004.  
Alternative(s):  Do not approve this request.  Staff will then need to purchase additional aluminum screens 
soon, and approximately every five years afterward.  
Fiscal Impact:  Sufficient funds are budgeted for the purchase of the stainless steel filter screens in Fund 
503-5033-4003-004.   
Personnel Impact:  Minimal staff time will be needed to install the screens.

Agenda Title:  ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION APPROVING AN AMENDMENT TO THE JOINT POWERS 
AGREEMENT OF THE MENDOCINO COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS TO ADD HOUSING MATTERS AS 
A SPECIFIC POWER 
Type: 
 Presentation   
 Consent   
 Regular Agenda   
 Public Hearing   
 Urgent   Time: 10 min 
Summary of Request:  On April 14, 2020, the City of Willits received a letter from the Mendocino Council 
of Governments (MCOG) requesting the City adopt a resolution amending the Joint Powers Agreement 
(JPA) with MCOG to add housing matters as a specific power within the JPA.   
In the 2019-20 Budget Act, Governor Gavin Newsom allocated $250 million for all regions, cities, and 
counties to do their part by prioritizing planning activities that accelerate housing production to meet 
identified needs of every community. With this allocation, the Department of Housing and Community 
Development established the Regional Early Action Planning Grant Program (REAP) with $125 million to 
regions. REAP provides one-time grant funding to regional governments and regional entities for planning 
activities that will accelerate housing production and facilitate compliance in implementing the sixth cycle of 
the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). 
Under this program, the Mendocino Council of Governments is eligible to receive a total of $383,245. 
Eligible activities include providing technical assistance, performing infrastructure planning, and conducting 
feasibility studies. Funds may also be sub allocated to cities and counties for these activities. MCOG’s Joint 
Powers Agreement (JPA) identifies specific duties for which MCOG is responsible. Although MCOG has 
always had RHNA responsibility, housing related planning is not an identified power within the JPA. 
Specific powers in the JPA include transportation planning, economic development planning, and “any 
other specific power, including regional planning in other functional areas besides transportation and 
economic development, which has been expressly authorized by Resolutions adopted by the respective 
bodies of each of the parties to this agreement.” 
On April 6, 2020, Mendocino Council of Governments (MCOG) board of directors unanimously agreed to 
amend the Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) to add a specific purpose to the powers of the Council related to 
planning for the production of housing in the region. Any amendments to the JPA require resolutions by the 
Cities of Fort Bragg, Point Arena, Willits and Ukiah and the County of Mendocino. 
Recommended Action: Staff recommends Council adopt the Resolution amending the Joint Powers 
Agreement (JPA) with MCOG to add housing matters as a specific power within the JPA. 
Alternative(s):  None recommended. 
Fiscal Impact:  Possible increased funding for planning grants through MCOG.

(REAP) grant program, which provides funding to regional agencies for planning activities 
related to housing production and implementation of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation; 
and 
 
WHEREAS, in order to utilize funding through the REAP grant program and to carry out 
responsibilities related to the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, it is proposed that the Joint 
Powers Agreement be amended to specify that the Joint Powers Agency has the authority to

amendments. 
 
3) All other terms and conditions set forth in MCOG’s Joint Powers Agreement of 1972 as 
amended in 1978, 1993, 1994 and 2008 shall remain in full force and effect.

underdeveloped areas; and,  
WHEREAS, by reason of this growth, governmental problems affecting incorporated and

the respective parties or other public entities in the County to initiate and complete a local 
project within their respective jurisdictions. It is understood, however, the recommendations

In the event of conflict amongst the members to the MCOG relative to specific issues, 
individual resolutions may be requested from each of the member agencies to be directed 
back to the MCOG for review and final action.

Dear Ms. Moorhead: 
Re: Proposed Amendment to MCOG 
Joint Powers Agreement 
On April 6, 2020, MCOG' 
s Board of 
Directors unanimously agreed to amend the Joint Powers 
Agreement (JP 
A) in order to add an additional specific purpose to the powers of 
the Council, that 
of 
''planning related to the production of 
housing in the region." The Board directed staff 
to 
circulate the enclosed amendment text, in the form of 
a sample resolution, to the five parties to 
MCOG' 
s Joint Powers Agreement, for approval by resolution of 
each of 
their legislative bodies. 
The JP 
A states as follows: 
10. This agreement may be amended at any time by the parties to the 
agreement. In order for such an amendment to take effect, it must be 
approved by Resolutions adopted by the respective legislative bodies of 
each of 
the parties to this agreement. 
We request that the City Council, as a party to MCOG's Joint Powers Agreement, consider this 
matter at the next available opportunity, according to your current agenda procedures. Time is of 
the essence, as certain State housing funds are available to MCOG on a limited schedule, once 
this amendment takes effect, that will benefit all of 
Mendocino County. 
I have enclosed our sample resolution with Exhibit A (JP 
A amendment) in electronic form, 
which has been reviewed and approved by the Council, for your use and reference. 
If 
there are any questions, you are welcome to contact me at 463-1859 or by email to 
orthj@dow-associates.com, or at the address on this letterhead. Thank you for your assis.
tance

AND CONDUCT FOR ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS  
Type: 
 Presentation  
 Consent  
 Regular Agenda 
 Public Hearing  
 Urgent   Time: 30 MIN 
Summary of Request:  Many, if not most, public agencies adopt a code of ethics to guide the conduct of 
their legislative bodies. Adopting a code serves to educate and remind a council members  how they are 
expected to interact with each other, with city staff, with the public and with other public agencies and to 
assure public confidence in the integrity of local government and its effective and fair operation.  
While state law prohibits municipal officers from engaging in certain conflicts of interest and unethical 
behavior, many local governments adopt their own ethics code that include additional restrictions. These 
policies cannot conflict with state law, but they can supplement it. Topics also typically include guidelines 
regarding the council-manager form of government; use of social media; and encouraging support of city 
staff and for council decisions.  
At the May 27, 2020 meeting the council members agreed to consider adopting a code of ethics. A 
comprehensive draft code of ethics based upon the code adopted by the City of Saratoga is attached for 
the council’s consideration and possible adoption.  
Recommended Action:  Move to adopt the attached draft Code of Ethics.  
Alternative(s):  Decline to adopt a code of ethics at this time or provide direction for revisions to the draft.  
Fiscal Impact:  None. 
Personnel Impact:  Adoption of the draft code of ethics will address council member interaction with City 
staff.

For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the Willits City 
Council or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 3 of 19 
Policy Purpose 
The Willits City Council has adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct for members of the City 
Council to assure public confidence in the integrity of local government and its effective and fair 
operation.  
A. ETHICS
The citizens and businesses of Willits are entitled to have fair, ethical and accountable local 
government which has earned the public’s full confidence for integrity. In keeping with the City of 
Willits's Commitment to Excellence, the effective functioning of democratic government 
therefore requires that: 

public officials, both elected and appointed, comply with both the letter and spirit of the laws
and policies affecting the operations of government;

public officials be independent, impartial and fair in their judgment and actions;

public office be used for the public good, not for personal gain; and

public deliberations and processes be conducted openly, unless legally confidential, in an
atmosphere of respect and civility.
To this end, the Willits City Council has adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct for members of the
City Council and of the City’s boards and commissions to assure public confidence in the 
integrity of local government and its effective and fair operation. The Ethics section of the City’s 
Code of Ethics and Conduct provides guidance on ethical issues and questions of right and wrong.    
1.
Act in the Public Interest. Recognizing that stewardship of the public interest must be their
primary concern, members will work for the common good of the people of Willits and not for
any private or personal interest, and they will assure fair and equal treatment of all persons,
claims and transactions coming before the Willits City Council, boards and commissions.
2.
Comply with both the spirit and the letter of the Law and City Policy. Members shall comply
with the laws of the nation, the State of California and the City of Willits in the
performance of their public duties. These laws include, but are not limited to: the United States
and California constitutions; laws pertaining to conflicts of interest, election campaigns,
financial disclosures, employer responsibilities, and open processes of government; and
City ordinances and policies.
3.
Conduct of Members. The professional and personal conduct of members must be above
reproach and avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Members shall refrain from abusive
conduct, personal charges or verbal attacks upon the character or motives of other members of
Council, boards and commissions, the staff or public.
4.
Respect for Process. Members shall perform their duties in accordance with the processes and
rules of order established by the City Council and board and commissions governing the
deliberation of public policy issues, meaningful involvement of the public, and implementation
of policy decisions of the City Council by City staff.
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the Willits City
Council or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 4 of 19 
5.
Conduct of Public Meetings. Members shall prepare themselves for public issues; listen
courteously and attentively to all public discussions before the body; and focus on the business
at hand. They shall refrain from interrupting other speakers; making personal comments not
germane to the business of the body; or otherwise interfering with the orderly conduct of
meetings.
6.
Decisions Based on Merit. Members shall base their decisions on the merits and substance of
the matter at hand, rather than on unrelated considerations.
7.
Communication. Members shall publicly disclose substantive information that is relevant to a
matter under consideration by the Council or boards and commissions, which they may have
received from sources outside of the public decision-making process.
8.
Conflict of Interest. In order to assure their independence and impartiality on behalf of the
common good, members shall not use their official positions to influence government
decisions in which they have a material financial interest, or where they have an organizational
responsibility or personal relationship which may give the appearance of a conflict of interest.
In accordance with the law, members shall disclose investments, interests in real property,
sources of income, and gifts; and they shall abstain from participating in deliberations and
decision-making where conflicts may exist.
9.
Gifts and Favors. Members shall not take any special advantage of services or opportunities for
personal gain, by virtue of their public office, that are not available to the public in general.
They shall refrain from accepting any gifts, favors or promises of future benefits which might
compromise their independence of judgment or action or give the appearance of being
compromised.
10. Confidential Information. Members shall respect the confidentiality of information concerning
the property, personnel or affairs of the City. They shall neither disclose confidential
information without proper legal authorization, nor use such information to advance their
personal, financial or other private interests.
11. Use of Public Resources. Members shall not use public resources not available to the public in
general, such as City staff time, equipment, supplies or facilities, for private gain or personal
purposes.
12. Representation of Private Interests. In keeping with their role as stewards of the public interest,
members of Council shall not appear on behalf of the private interests of third parties before
the Council or any board, commission or proceeding of the City, nor shall members of boards
and commissions appear before their own bodies or before the Council on behalf of the private
interests of third parties on matters related to the areas of service of their bodies.
13. Advocacy. Members shall represent the official policies or positions of the City Council, board
or commission to the best of their ability when designated as delegates for this purpose. When
presenting their individual opinions and positions, members shall explicitly state they do not
represent their body or the City of Willits, nor will they allow the inference that they do.
Councilmembers and board and commission members have the right to endorse candidates for 
all Council seats or other elected offices. It is inappropriate to mention or display endorsements 
during Council meetings, board/commission meetings, or other official City meetings. 
14. Policy Role of Members. Members shall respect and adhere to the council-manager structure
of Willits City government. In this structure, the City Council determines the policies of the
City with the advice, information and analysis provided by the public, boards and
commissions, and City staff. Members therefore shall not interfere with the administrative
functions of the City or the professional duties of City staff; nor shall they impair the
ability of staff to implement Council policy decisions.
15. Independence of boards and commissions. Because of the value of the independent advice of
boards and commissions to the public decision-making process, members of Council shall
refrain from using their position to unduly influence the deliberations or outcomes of board
and commission proceedings.
16. Positive Work Place Environment. Members shall support the maintenance of a positive and
constructive work place environment for City employees and for citizens and businesses
dealing with the City. Members shall recognize their special role in dealings with City
employees to in no way create the perception of inappropriate direction to staff.
B. CONDUCT
The Conduct section of the City’s Code of Ethics and Conduct is designed to describe the manner 
in which Councilmembers and board and commission members should treat one another, City 
staff, constituents, and others they come into contact with in representing the City of Willits.
The 
constant 
and 
consistent 
theme 
through 
all 
of 
the 
conduct 
guidelines 
is "respect." Councilmembers experience heavy workloads and tremendous stress in making 
decisions that could impact hundreds of lives. Despite these pressures, elected and appointed 
officials are called upon to exhibit appropriate behavior at all times. Demonstrating respect for 
each individual through words and actions is the touchstone that can help guide 
Councilmembers and board and commission members to do the right thing in even the most 
difficult situations.
1. Elected and Appointed Officials’ Conduct with One Another
"In life, courtesy and self-possession, and in the arts, style, are the sensible impressions of the free 
mind, for both arise out of a deliberate shaping of all things and from never being swept away, 
whatever the emotion, into confusion or dullness." 
 -- William Butler Yeats For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to 
any member of the  City Council or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council 
policy. 
Page 5 of 19 
Elected and appointed officials are composed of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds, 
personalities, values, opinions, and goals. Despite this diversity, all have chosen to serve in public 
office in order to preserve and protect the present and the future of the community. In all cases, this 
common goal should be acknowledged even though individuals may "agree to disagree" on 
contentious issues. 
1(a). In Public Meetings 
Practice civility and decorum in discussions and debate 
Difficult questions, tough challenges to a particular point of view, and criticism of ideas and 
information are legitimate elements of a free democracy in action. This does not allow, however, 
public officials to make belligerent, personal, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive, or 
disparaging comments. No shouting or physical actions that could be construed as threatening will 
be tolerated. 
Honor the role of the chair in maintaining order 
It is the responsibility of the chair to keep the comments of members on track during public 
meetings. Members should honor efforts by the chair to focus discussion on current agenda items. If 
there is disagreement about the agenda or the chair’s actions, those objections should be voiced 
politely and with reason, following procedures outlined in parliamentary procedure. 
Avoid personal comments that could offend other members 
If a member is personally offended by the remarks of another member, the offended member should 
make notes of the actual words used and call for a "point of personal privilege" that challenges the 
other member to justify or apologize for the language used. The chair will maintain control of this 
discussion. 
Demonstrate effective problem-solving approaches 
Members have a public stage to show how individuals with disparate points of view can find 
common ground and seek a compromise that benefits the community as a whole.  
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the  City Council 
or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 6 of 19 
1(b). In Private Encounters 
Continue respectful behavior in private and in social media of all kinds
The same level of respect and consideration of differing points of view that is deemed appropriate 
for public discussions should be maintained in private conversations and in social media.
Be aware of the insecurity of written notes, voicemail messages, and E-mail 
Technology allows words written or said without much forethought to be distributed wide and far. 
Would you feel comfortable to have this note faxed to others? How would you feel if this voicemail 
message were played on a speaker phone in a full office? What would happen if this E-mail 
message were forwarded to others? Written notes, voicemail messages and e-mail should be 
treated as potentially "public" communication. 
Even private conversations can have a public presence  
Elected and appointed officials are always on display – their actions, mannerisms, and language are 
monitored by people around them that they may not know. Lunch table conversations will be 
eavesdropped upon, parking lot debates will be watched, and casual comments between individuals 
before and after public meetings noted. 
2. Elected and Appointed Officials’ Conduct with City Staff
"Never let a problem become an excuse." 
-- Robert Schuller 
Governance of a City relies on the cooperative efforts of elected officials, who set policy, appointed 
officials who advise the elected, and City staff who implements and administers the Council’s 
policies. Therefore, every effort should be made to be cooperative and show mutual respect for the 
contributions made by each individual for the good of the community.  
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the  City Council 
or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy.

Page 8 of 19 
Treat all staff as professionals 
Clear, honest communication that respects the abilities, experience, and dignity of each individual is 
expected. Poor behavior towards staff is not acceptable. 
Member questions/inquiries to City staff 
1. General. Council and board/commission communications with City staff should be limited to 
normal City business hours unless the circumstances warrant otherwise. Responses to Council 
questions posed outside of normal business hours should be expected no earlier than the next 
business day.
2. Routine Requests for Information and Inquiries. Members may contact staff directly for 
information made readily available to the general public on a regular basis (e.g., “What are the 
pool’s hours of operation?” or “How does one reserve the community center?”). Under these 
circumstances staff shall treat the member no differently than they would the general 
public, and the member shall not use their elected status to secure preferential treatment. The 
city manager does not need to be advised of such contacts.
3. Non-Routine Requests for Readily Available Information. Members may also contact staff 
directly for easily retrievable information not routinely requested by the general public so long 
as it does not require staff to discuss the issue or express an opinion (e.g., “How many traffic 
lights are there in the City?” or “Under what circumstances does the City lower its flags to half 
mast?”).
4. Non-Routine Requests Requiring Special Effort. Any member request or inquiry that requires 
staff to compile information that is not readily available or easily retrievable and/or that requests 
staff to express an opinion (legal or otherwise) must be directed to the city manager, or to the 
city attorney, as appropriate (e.g., “How many Study Issues completed over the past five years 
have required 500 or more hours of staff time?”, or “What is the logic behind the City’s food 
truck ordinances affecting businesses along Main Street?”). The city manager (or city attorney 
as appropriate) shall be responsible for distributing such requests to his/her staff for follow-
up. Responses to such requests shall be copied to all Councilmembers (if originating 
from a Councilmember), relevant board or commission members (if originating from a 
board or commission member), the city manager, the city attorney as appropriate and affected 
department directors.
5. Meeting Requests. Any member request for a meeting with staff must be directed to the city 
manager or city attorney, as appropriate.
6. Public Safety Restrictions. Under certain circumstances, requests for information regarding 
operations or personnel of the Department of Public Safety may be legally restricted. Applicable 
statutes include: The Peace Officers’ Procedural Bill of Rights (California Government Code
Section 3300, et seq.), Confidentiality of Peace Officer Records (California Penal Code Section 
832.5-7), and a number of exceptions to the California Public Records Act, defined in 
Government Code Section 6254. Providing information in response to such requests could 
violate the law, and might also violate due process rights that have been defined for peace 
officers in the State of California. Accordingly, it shall be the policy of the City of Willits to
strictly comply with all applicable legal authorities governing the release of Department of 
Public Safety information and records.  
Do not disrupt City staff from their jobs 
Elected and appointed officials should not disrupt City staff while they are in meetings, on the 
phone, or engrossed in performing their job functions in order to have their individual needs met. 
Do not attend City staff meetings unless requested by staff – even if the elected or appointed official 
does not say anything, his or her presence implies support, shows partiality, intimidates staff, and 
hampers staff’s ability to do their job objectively.  
Never publicly criticize an individual employee 
Elected and appointed officials should never express concerns about the performance of a City 
employee in public, to the employee directly, or to the employee’s manager. This includes 
comments made on social media.  Comments about staff performance should only be made to
the city manager through private correspondence or conversation. Comments about staff in the 
office of the city attorney should be made directly to the city attorney. Appointed officials should 
make their comments regarding staff to the city manager or the Mayor. 
Do not get involved in administrative functions 
Elected and appointed officials must not attempt to influence City staff on the making of 
appointments, awarding of contracts, selecting of consultants, processing of development 
applications, or granting of City licenses and permits. There shall be no Council interference in 
administrative functions of staff members.
Check with City staff on correspondence before taking action 
Before sending correspondence, Councilmembers should check with City staff to see if an official 
City response has already been sent or is in progress. Board and commission members shall not 
send correspondence except as authorized under the City’s policies governing volunteers. 
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the  City Council 
or the City’s boards and commissions established by  City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 9 of 19 
Do not solicit political support from staff 
Elected and appointed officials should not solicit any type of political support (financial 
contributions, display of posters or lawn signs, name on support list, etc.) from City staff. City staff 
may, as private citizens with constitutional rights, support political candidates but all such activities 
must be done away from the workplace. 
3. Elected and Appointed Officials’ Conduct with the Public
"If a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it shows he is a citizen of the world, and that his 
heart is no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that joins to them." 
-- Francis Bacon 
3(a). In Public Meetings 
Making the public feel welcome is an important part of the democratic process. No signs of 
partiality, prejudice or disrespect should be evident on the part of individual members toward an 
individual participating in a public forum. Every effort should be made to be fair and impartial in 
listening to public testimony. 
Be welcoming to speakers and treat them with care and gentleness. While questions of clarification 
may be asked, the official’s primary role during public testimony is to listen. 
The way that Council treats people during public hearings can do a lot to make them relax or to 
push their emotions to a higher level of intensity.
Be fair and equitable in allocating public hearing time to individual speakers. 
The chair will determine and announce limits on speakers at the start of the public hearing process. 
Questions should not be asked for the express purpose of allowing one speaker to evade the 
time limit imposed on all others (e.g., “Was there something else you wanted to say?”). Generally, 
each speaker will be allocated three minutes with applicants. If many speakers are 
anticipated, the chair may shorten the time limit and/or ask speakers to limit themselves to new 
information and points of view not already covered by previous speakers.  
No speaker will be turned away unless he or she exhibits inappropriate behavior. Each speaker may 
only speak once during the public hearing unless the chair requests additional clarification later in 
the process. After the close of the public hearing, no more public testimony will be accepted unless 
the chair reopens the public hearing for a limited and specific purpose. 
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the  City Council 
or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 10 of 19 
Give the appearance of active listening 
It is disconcerting to speakers to have members not look at them when they are speaking. It is fine 
to look down at documents or to make notes, but reading for a long period of time or gazing around 
the room gives the appearance of disinterest. Be aware of facial expressions, especially those that 
could be interpreted as "smirking," disbelief, anger or boredom. 
Maintain an open mind 
Members of the public deserve an opportunity to influence the thinking of elected and appointed 
officials. To express an opinion or pass judgment prior to the close of a public hearing casts doubt 
on a member’s ability to conduct a fair review of the issue. This is particularly important when 
officials are serving in a quasi-judicial capacity. 
Ask for clarification, but avoid debate and argument with the public 
Only the chair – not individual members – can interrupt a speaker during a presentation. However, a 
member can ask the chair for a point of order if the speaker is off the topic or exhibiting behavior or 
language the member finds disturbing.  
If speakers become flustered or defensive by questions, it is the responsibility of the chair to calm 
and focus the speaker and to maintain the order and decorum of the meeting. Questions by members 
to the public testifying should seek to clarify or expand information. It is never appropriate to 
belligerently challenge or belittle the speaker. Members’ personal opinions or inclinations about 
upcoming votes should not be revealed until after the public hearing is closed. 
No personal attacks of any kind, under any circumstance 
Members should be aware that their body language and tone of voice, as well as the words they use, 
can appear to be intimidating or aggressive. 
Follow parliamentary procedure in conducting public meetings 
The city attorney serves as advisory parliamentarian for the City and is available to answer 
questions or interpret situations according to parliamentary procedures. The chair, subject to the 
appeal of the full Council or board/commission makes final rulings on parliamentary procedure. 
3(b). In Unofficial Settings 
Make no promises on behalf of the Council, board/commission or City 
Members will frequently be asked to explain a Council or board/commission action or to give their 
opinion about an issue as they meet and talk with constituents in the community. It is appropriate to 
give a brief overview of City policy and to refer to City staff for further information. It is 
inappropriate to overtly or implicitly promise Council or board/commission action, or to promise 
City staff will do something specific (fix a pothole, remove a library book, plant new flowers in the 
median, etc.). 
Make no personal comments about other members 
It is acceptable to publicly disagree about an issue, but it is unacceptable to make derogatory 
comments about other members, their opinions and actions. 
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the City Council 
or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 11 of 19 
Remember that Willits is a small town at heart
Members are constantly being observed by the community every day that they serve in office. Their 
behaviors and comments serve as models for proper deportment in the City of Willits. Honesty and
respect for the dignity of each individual should be reflected in every word and action taken by 
members, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is a serious and continuous responsibility. 
4. Council Conduct with Other Public Agencies
"Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest." 
-- Mark Twain 
Be clear about representing the City or personal interests 
When representing the City, the Councilmember must support and advocate the official City 
position on an issue, not a personal viewpoint. Outside of official board or commission meetings, 
board and commission members are not authorized to represent the City or their board or 
commission unless specifically designated by the Council or the board or commission to do so for a 
particular purpose.  
When representing another organization whose position is different from the City, the 
Councilmember should withdraw from voting on the issue if it significantly impacts or is 
detrimental to the City’s interest. Councilmembers should be clear about which organizations they 
represent and inform the Mayor and Council of their involvement. 
Correspondence also should be equally clear about representation 
City letterhead may be used when the Councilmember is representing the City and the City’s 
official position. A copy of official correspondence should be given to the City Clerk to be 
filed  as part of the permanent public record.  City letterhead should not be used for non-City 
business nor for correspondence representing a dissenting point of view from an official Council 
position.  
5. Council Conduct with Boards and Commissions
If attending a board or commission meeting, be careful to only express personal opinions 
Councilmembers may attend any board or commission meeting, which are always open to any 
member of the public. However, they should be sensitive to the way their participation especially if 
it is on behalf of an individual, business or developer -- could be viewed as unfairly affecting the 
process. Any public comments by a Councilmember at a board or commission meeting should be 
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the Willits City 
Council or the City’s boards and commissions established by  City Ordinance or Council policy.

clearly made as individual opinion and not a representation of the feelings of the entire City 
Council.  
Limit contact with board and commission members to questions of clarification 
It is inappropriate for a Councilmember to contact a board or commission member to lobby on 
behalf of an individual, business, or developer, and vice versa. It is acceptable for Councilmembers 
to contact board or commission members in order to clarify a position taken by the board or 
commission. 
Remember that boards and commissions serve the community, not individual Councilmembers 
The City Council appoints individuals to serve on boards and commissions, and it is the 
responsibility of boards and commissions to follow policy established by the Council. But board 
and commission members do not report to individual Councilmembers, nor should Councilmembers 
feel they have the power or right to threaten board and commission members with removal if they 
disagree about an issue. Appointment and re-appointment to a board or commission should be based 
on such criteria as expertise, ability to work with staff and the public, and commitment to fulfilling 
official duties. A board or commission appointment should not be used as a political "reward."  
Be respectful of diverse opinions 
A primary role of boards and commissions is to represent many points of view in the community 
and to provide the Council with advice based on a full spectrum of concerns and perspectives. 
Councilmembers may have a closer working relationship with some individuals serving on boards 
and commissions, but must be fair and respectful of all citizens serving on boards and commissions. 
Keep political support away from public forums  
Board and commission members may offer political support to a Councilmember, but not in a 
public forum while conducting official duties. Conversely, Councilmembers may support board and 
commission members who are running for office, but not in an official forum in their capacity as a 
Councilmember. 
6. Conduct with the Media
"Keep them well fed and never let them know that all you’ve got is a chair and a whip." 
-- Lion Tamer School 
Board and commission members are not authorized to represent the City outside of official 
board/commission meetings unless specifically authorized to do so.  
Councilmembers are frequently contacted by the media for background and quotes. 
The best advice for dealing with the media is to never go "off the record" 
Most members of the media represent the highest levels of journalistic integrity and ethics, and can 
be trusted to keep their word. But one bad experience can be catastrophic. Words that are not said 
cannot be quoted. 
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the Willits City
Council or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 13 of 19 
The Mayor is the official spokesperson for the City on City positions. 
The Mayor is the designated representative of the Council to present and speak on the official City 
position. If an individual Councilmember is contacted by the media, the Councilmember should be 
clear about whether their comments represent the official City position or a personal viewpoint. 
Choose words carefully and cautiously 
Comments taken out of context can cause problems. Be especially cautious about humor, sardonic 
asides, sarcasm, or word play. It is never appropriate to use personal slurs or swear words when 
talking with the media.  
C. SANCTIONS
"You cannot have a proud and chivalrous spirit if your conduct is mean and paltry; 
for whatever a man’s actions are, such must be his spirit." 
-- Demosthenes 
Model of Excellence 
City Councilmembers, Board and Commission Members, and Council appointees who do not sign 
the Model of Excellence (Appendix A) shall be ineligible for intergovernmental assignments or 
Council subcommittees.  
Ethics Training for Local Officials 
City Councilmembers, Board and Commission Members, and Council appointees who are out of 
compliance with State- or City-mandated requirements for ethics training shall not represent the 
City on intergovernmental assignments or Council sub-committees, and may be subject to 
sanctions.  
Public Disruption 
Members of the public who do not follow proper conduct after a warning in a public hearing may be 
barred from further testimony at that meeting or removed from the Council Chambers. 
Inappropriate Staff Behavior 
Councilmembers should refer to the city manager any City staff or to the city attorney any City 
Attorney’s staff who do not follow proper conduct in their dealings with Councilmembers, other 
City staff, or the public. These employees may be disciplined in accordance with standard City 
procedures for such actions. (Please refer to the section on Council Conduct with City Staff for 
more details on interaction with Staff.) 
Councilmembers Behavior and Conduct 
Compliance and Enforcement. The Willits Code of Ethics and Conduct expresses standards of 
ethical conduct expected for members of the City Council, boards and commissions. Members
themselves have the primary responsibility to assure that ethical standards are understood and met, 
and that the public can continue to have full confidence in the integrity of government. The chairs of 
boards and commissions and the Mayor and Council have the additional responsibility to 
For ease of reference in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the term “member” refers to any member of the Willits City 
Council or the City’s boards and commissions established by City Ordinance or Council policy. 
Page 14 of 19 
intervene when actions of members that appear to be in violation of the Code of Ethics and Conduct 
are brought to their attention.  
City Councilmembers who intentionally and repeatedly do not follow proper conduct may be 
reprimanded or formally censured by the Council, lose seniority or committee assignments 
(both within the City of Willits or with inter-government agencies) or have official travel
restricted. Serious infractions of the Code of Ethics or Code of Conduct could lead to other 
sanctions as deemed appropriate by Council. 
Councilmembers should point out to the offending Councilmember infractions of the Code of Ethics 
and Conduct. If the offenses continue, then the matter should be referred to the Mayor in private. If 
the Mayor is the individual whose actions are being challenged, then the matter should be referred 
to the Vice Mayor.  
It is the responsibility of the Mayor to initiate action if a Councilmember’s behavior may warrant 
sanction. If no action is taken by the Mayor, the alleged violation(s) can be brought up with the full 
Council in a public meeting.  
Board and Commission Members Behavior and Conduct 
Counseling, verbal reprimands and written warnings may be administered by the Mayor to board 
and commission members failing to comply with City policy. These lower levels of sanctions shall 
be kept private to the degree allowed by law. Copies of all written reprimands administered by the 
Mayor shall be distributed in memo format to the chair of the respective board or commission, the 
city clerk, the city attorney, the city manager, and the City Council. Written reprimands 
administered by the Mayor shall not be included in packets for public meetings and shall not be 
publicized except as required under the Public Records Act.   
The City Council may impose sanctions on board and commission members whose conduct does 
not comply with the City’s policies, up to and including removal from office. Any form of 
discipline imposed by Council shall be determined by a majority vote of at least a quorum of the 
Council at a noticed public meeting and such action shall be preceded by a Report to Council with 
supporting documentation. The Report to Council shall be distributed in accordance with normal 
procedures, including hard copies to numerous public facilities and posting online. Any Report to 
Council addressing alleged misconduct by a board or commission member shall be routed through 
the Office of the city attorney for review of whether any information is exempt from disclosure 
(subject to redaction) based on privacy interests authorized under the Public Records Act.  
When deemed warranted, the Mayor or majority of Council may call for an investigation of board 
or commission member conduct. Should the city manager or city attorney believe an investigation is 
warranted, they shall confer with the Mayor or Council. The Mayor or Council shall ask the city 
manager and/or the city attorney to investigate the allegation and report the findings. 
The results of any such investigation shall be provided to the full Council in the form of a Report to 
Council, and shall be placed on the agenda of a noticed public meeting as “Information Only”. Any 
such report shall be made public and distributed in accordance with normal procedures (i.e., hard 
copies to numerous public locations and posted online). Any report to Council addressing the

Council or the City’s boards and commissions established by tCity Ordinance or Council policy.

investigation of board and commission members shall be routed through the Office of the City 
Attorney for review of whether any information is exempt from disclosure (subject to redaction) 
based on privacy interests authorized under the Public Records Act. 
It shall be the Mayor and/or the Council’s responsibility to determine the next appropriate action. 
Any such action taken by Council (with the exception of “take no further action”) shall be 
conducted at a noticed public hearing. These actions include, but are not limited to: discussing and 
counseling the individual on the violations; placing the matter on a future public hearing agenda to 
consider sanctions; forming a Council ad hoc subcommittee to review the allegation, the 
investigation and its findings, as well as to recommend sanction options for Council consideration. 
The City Council also may remove members of boards and commissions from office. A
violation of this Code of Ethics and Conduct shall not be considered a basis for challenging the 
validity of a Council, board or commission decision.
