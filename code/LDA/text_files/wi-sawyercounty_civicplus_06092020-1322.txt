SAWYER COUNTY HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES BOARD BYLAWS 
 
ARTICLE 1:  Introduction  
The Sawyer County (“County”) Board of Supervisors (“County Board of Supervisors”) has the 
responsibility for the well-being, treatment and care of persons experiencing social, mental and 
physical disabilities, including but not limited to, health care, mental illness treatment, 
developmental disabilities services, income maintenance, extended supervision and parole 
services, alcohol and drug abuse services, services to children, youth and aging, family 
counseling, special education services, and manpower services. These services are provided 
through the Sawyer County Department of Health & Human Services (the “Department”) 
established by the County Board of Supervisors under Wis. Stat. § 46.23.  
ARTICLE II:  Authorization  
The Sawyer County Health & Human Services Board (the “Board”) was created and authorized

and is authorized to administer the powers and duties prescribed under Wis. Stat. § 46.23(5) and 
Wis. Stat. § 251.04.  It is the intent of the Board and the County Board of Supervisors that these 
Bylaws of the Sawyer County Health and Human Services Board Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) 
supplement the Board’s obligations and authority as set forth in Wis. Stat. Ch. 46, Wis. Stat. Ch.

Chair shall be members of the County Board of Supervisors.  The Board Chair

taxpayers who bear unmet costs. 
RESIDENTIAL: 
Completion of an admission and residential financial information form including income, 
assets and signature certifying all information provided is true and correct, will be 
required to determine monthly ability to pay. 
A redetermination of ability to pay shall be made at any time during the treatment or 
payment period that a significant change (increase or decrease) occurs in available 
income. 
Accounts receivable will review client eligibility no less than annually.  
A determination of no ability to pay does not dismiss client liability. 
If the client has no ability to pay at time of determination, collection activities will cease 
until a redetermination is warranted (no less than annually). 
The ability to pay dollar amount will be the required monthly payment. 
The monthly payment will be required until the outstanding client liability is satisfied or 
the ten (10) year statute of limitations from the date of service pursuant to Wis. Stat.     
§ 893.87 has been reached. 
A statement with total outstanding client liability will be provided to all clients 
regardless of their ability to pay. 
Services must be programmatically necessary, as determined by the provider.  If services 
deemed NOT PROGRAMMATICALLY NECESSARY are desired, the full cost for these 
services are the responsibility of the client at the time of service. 
All accounts must be kept current.  After ninety (90) days of non-payment and provision 
of three billing statements an account will be turned over to the Wisconsin Department 
of Health Services, Bureau of Fiscal Services for collection. 
The program director may recommend an adjustment to a client liability due to 
extenuating circumstances.  Any adjustments to a client’s ability to pay, as noted on 
their residential financial form, must be approved by the HHS director. 
Clients may request a review of their account balance and a potential reduction in their 
liability due to financial hardship.  The HHS director will approve or deny such requests 
as per DHS 1.06 (4).
