PUBLIC COMMENTS  
Tatum Stafford, Butler County Clerk, came before the Board to discuss re-opening plans for the 
Driver’s License office. Mrs. Stafford stated Q-Less Line Management is in the process of being 
installed and she hoped to open the office by Monday, June 15th. Mrs. Stafford also stated the 
office will only be accepting Butler County residents upon re-opening. Mrs. Stafford also 
informed the Board that yesterday, June 1, was the deadline to file to run for election.  
 
(00:04:19) 
ITEM #1 – WORK SESSION – COVID-19 UPDATE 
Jamie Downs, Butler County Health Department Director, came before the Board to give an 
update on the COVID-19 virus. Mrs. Downs stated Butler County has thirty-four positive cases 
and two probable cases at this time. One person is hospitalized currently and twenty-six have 
recovered. Mrs. Downs stated the testing rate is now 20.2, which is the state requirement. Mrs. 
Downs shared Dr. Norman’s concerns regarding COVID’s R-naught, which is the virus’s 
infection rate. Mrs. Downs stated one person can infect up to 5.87 people and the rate in Kansas 
is 0.87. Mrs. Downs stated Kansas is ranked #7 in the Nation for slowing down the spread of the 
virus and attributes that to people staying home and following the directives. Mrs. Downs stated 
she hopes Kansas continues to maintain social distancing so we can return to a new normal. Mrs. 
Downs stated within the last week Butler County has added six new positive cases and the Wal-
Mart testing site has tested sixty-two people so far. Mrs. Downs stated since March her staff has 
worked 1,636 hours, strictly on COVID, and 126 of those hours are overtime.  
 
Keri Korthals, Emergency Management Director, came before the Board to give an update on 
COVID-19. Ms. Korthals stated Governor Kelly vetoed House Bill 2702, which included the 
extension of the Emergency Declaration. Ms. Korthals stated a new declaration was issued and it 
did not require the act of the Legislature, although it only lasts for fifteen days and must be 
discussed again tomorrow by the Legislature to extend it, per statute. Ms. Korthals stated the Ad 
Astra re-opening plan went from an executive order to guidance. Ms. Korthals stated the new 
declaration does not invalidate any prior declarations.

Administrator Johnson discussed the difference between an “order” and a “declaration”. 
Administrator Johnson stated Butler County has no intention to put their own orders in place and 
will continue to follow State and Federal guidance. Administrator Johnson stated he was 
unaware the State was not going update the Ad Astra Plan and does not feel the State is giving 
much guidance right now. Administrator Johnson recommended extending the County’s 
Emergency Declaration with no orders and expressed the importance of the Emergency 
Declaration for Personal Protective Equipment and the CARES Act. The declaration also allows 
Counties to get support from the State for reimbursement.  
 
Jordan Buxton, El Dorado Chamber of Commerce Director, presented the Board with a copy of 
the re-opening poster for the City of El Dorado. Ms. Buxton stated she worked with Attorney 
Martin Pringle to prepare the document and it provides insight on the safety practices that El 
Dorado has taken.  Ms. Buxton stated the Chamber is working with El Dorado Inc. to help 
provide relief to small businesses who have been financially impacted by COVID-19.  
 
Commissioner Myers felt if the Board adopts a new declaration they would be taking a step 
backwards for Butler County. Commissioner Myers stated he feels the County should be in a 
situation where an end in sight is anticipated, and does not feel the declaration is justified any 
longer and it is not a proper mark of leadership. Commissioner Myers stated he is prepared to let 
the Declaration lapse because we are no longer experiencing an emergency. Commissioner 
Woydziak stated he understands Commissioner Myers concerns and suggested extending the 
Emergency Declaration for only one week.  
 
Commission Chairman Murphy motioned to extend the Emergency Declaration for one week.   
Commissioner Wheeler seconded the motion. Motion carried 4-1. Commissioner Myers 
opposed.  
 
(00:58:36)

buildings. Mr. Ingalls stated he would also like to price new guttering on the Community 
Corrections building as an alternate bid.

Board of County Commissioners Agenda Item Report
Agenda Item No. 2
Submitted by: Frank Williams
Submitting Department: Emergency Medical Services 
Meeting Date: June 9, 2020
SUBJECT
Ambulance Replacement Bid Opening
RECOMMENDATION
Recommend receiving and open sealed bids for the replacement of 2 EMS ambulances.  Direction EMS staff to review
and bring back recommendations.
ATTACHMENTS
BACKGROUND
The EMS Department utilizes ambulances as a primary tool to respond to 911  emergency requests, hospital to hospital
transfers and transporting of patients to hospitals.  To maintain a safe and efficient fleet of ambulances, EMS provides a
recommended Capital Improvement Plan each year for review to create a roadmap for ambulance replacement.  We
closely monitor the safety and mechanical health of each vehicle in our fleet maintenance program.  Our current
ambulance mileage, hours of use and years of service indicate the need to replace an ambulance each 9 months.  Our
goal is to maintain 7 ambulances, 5 front-line and 2 spares.  Current fleet = 5 front-line and 1 spare.  2019 ambulance
new ambulance, Type II van style, is scheduled to arrive in late July.
ANALYSIS
On 6/26/2020, the County Commissioners authorized EMS to solicit bids for 2 - Type III (Box Style) ambulances for
purchase considerations as allocated in the FY2020 approved CIP plan.   The deadline for sealed bid submission was
5:00 PM CDT on June 8.  These sealed bids have been provided for opening at today's meeting.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION
EMS Capital Improvement Plan has recently been reviewed and approved by the Board of County Commission, that
includes the replacement of 2 EMS Ambulances (Type III - Box Style) in the amount of $300,000.00 for FY2020 +
Insurance claim payment of $142,000.00 for a total of $442,000.00 allocated, if approved, for these purchases.

Submitting Department: Planning & Zoning 
Meeting Date: June 9, 2020
SUBJECT
Community Development Truck Bid Opening 
RECOMMENDATION
Consider receiving and accepting the bids for replacement of two (2) 1/2 ton trucks the Department of Community
Development
ATTACHMENTS

2020 Community Development Truck Bids.docx
BACKGROUND
The Office of Community  Development has for years taken advantage of used Trucks handed down from the Sheriff's
Department as our mode of transportation for the Building Inspectors. in 2019, working with the County Administrator,
we were able to Budget $64,000 for the purchase of 2 new replacement Trucks.  On May 19 the Board of County
Commission approved the request from our office to solicit Bids for the replacement of the Trucks.
ANALYSIS
In pursing Bids for the Trucks I didn't feel it was fair to solicit Bids through the State Contracts as that allows Bids from
outside Butler County. Since Butler County Taxpayers are paying for the Trucks and the local Dealers are paying Taxes
to the County I only solicited Bids from the 3 locals. 
Bids received were as follows:
Vendor                                       Make/Model                                                           Bid                   Total
Parks Motors                             2020 Dodge 1500 Classic ST Quad                $25,131/Truck       $50,262
Don Hattan                                2020 Ford F-150 Super Cab                             $29,500/Truck    $59,000
John K. Fisher(a)                       No Model Submitted                                          No Bid
          (a)  On May 27, 2020 @ 8:10AM I received a call from Tony Grunder that John K. Fisher would not be          
                submitting a Bid.
All Bids met the Specs as submitted.
Staffs recommendation is to approve the Bid submitted by Parks Motors in the Total Amount of $50,262 and direct the
Director to place the order for delivery.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION
The 2020 Budget has $64,000 in the CIP and those are the dollars that we will be using to pay for the 2 Trucks.
