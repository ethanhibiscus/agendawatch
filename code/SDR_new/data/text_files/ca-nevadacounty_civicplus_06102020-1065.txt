DESCRIPTION: A Tentative Parcel Map application (TPM19-0154) proposing to divide a 31.88-acre parcel 
zoned AG-PD into two parcels (11.01-acres and 20.87-acres in size). The northerly proposed parcel would 
take access from Oak Springs Road, at an existing access point, while the southerly proposed parcel would 
take access off of Indian Springs Road at an existing access point. Proposed Parcel 1 is developed with 
agricultural improvements as well as an existing guesthouse and septic system. Proposed Parcel 2 is developed 
with single-family residential improvements including an individual well and septic system. Minimum Useable 
Sewage Disposal Areas are delineated on both parcels, setting aside area for septic disposal and/or future repair. 
A shared agreement for both residences (with easement) for the one (1) existing well will be required, or a 
separate water source (wells) for each parcel may be provided. Building envelopes are delineated on both 
proposed parcels. The building envelope on proposed Parcel 1 would allow potential future single-family 
residence improvements.  The project includes the consideration of a Oak Management Plan (MGT20-0023) 
to minimize impacts to the protected resources on the parcel. The project also includes an Agricultural 
Management Plan (MGT20-0022) to minimize impacts to important farmlands.  APN: 051-410-012. 
RECOMMENDED ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION: Approve the Mitigated Negative 
Declaration (EIS20-0004) RECOMMENDED PROJECT ACTION: Approve the proposed Tentative Parcel
