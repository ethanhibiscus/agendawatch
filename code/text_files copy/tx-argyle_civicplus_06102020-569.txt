Project Updates: 
At the previous meeting (May 20, 2020), the EDC authorized staff to spend up to $750 over a 
period of six weeks to extend the Experience Argyle advertising campaign. 
 
Staff contacted businesses by phone to complete the email list as fully as possible. Businesses 
who did not participate in the first round of advertising were contacted again, along with those 
that were added to the list. In addition, staff contacted ETJ businesses to invite them to 
participate. 
 
Due to the phasing in of re-openings, staff changed the name of the campaign to just “Experience 
Argyle”, taking away the emphasis on “home”. Staff also created an animated video that more 
prominently featured logos of the participating businesses.
