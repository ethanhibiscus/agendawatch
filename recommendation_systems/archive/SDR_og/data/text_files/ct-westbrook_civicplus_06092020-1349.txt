MEMORANDUM
To:
Noel Bishop
From:
Duncan J. Forsyth
Date:
June 2, 2020
Re:
Use of Fireworks
Our File No. 06891.2
We have, at your request, researched the legality of possession and use of
fireworks in the State of Connecticut. Section 29-357(a) makes it illegal to sell,
use or explode any fireworks with the exception of sparklers or fountains of not
more than 100 grams of pyrotechnic mixture per item which are non-explosive
and non-aerial, provided such sparklers or fountains do not contain magnesium
and other limitations set forth in the statute.
Subsection (d) of the same statute states that any person who possesses or
uses illegal fireworks is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.
Based on the above, we believe it is appropriate for the town to give notice that
individuals who possess or use illegal fireworks will be subject to arrest as noted
above.
For your convenience, we have attached a copy of Section 29-357 with the
applicable provisions highlighted.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us

appointments and elections requiring in-person votes. EO 700 extended the deadlines for electing municipal and
regional government/ such that nominations shall be held on June 9/ 2020 and elections shall be held between June 27
and June 30, 2020. These nominating and election town meetings shall to the greatest extent possible be conducted
using remote means in accordance with the open meeting provisions of Executive Order No. 7B/ while also

graduated from Westbrook High School. I am an unaffiliated voter in the Town. 1 have a Bacchelor's degree in
Environmental Science and am currently the Sanitarian for the Town ofGuilford/so I feel I have the necessary
background to make informed decisions on the WPCA. I hope you and the Board ofSelectmen will give me the
opportunity to serve the town in this capacity.
Thank you for your consideration.
