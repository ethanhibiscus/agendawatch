1) CALL TO ORDER, ROLL CALL   
 
 
 
The meeting was called to order at 3:00 p.m. with the following members present: 
Josie Thompson (3/3), Todd Brown (3/3) and Sue Poltera (2/3). Dan Garber (2/3), 
was absent.  Planning Staff in attendance were Ryan Hvitløk, Director of Planning 
and Development; Jim Seitnater, Housing and Downtown Development; and 
Charlene Mosier, Planning Technician. 
 
2) APPROVAL OF MINUTES 
 
The minutes from March 3, 2020 were approved on a motion by Poltera, seconded 
by Brown, passed unanimously.   
 
3) ANNOUNCEMENTS 
 
a. Seitnater said the Chamber of Commerce has spoken with someone wanting to 
start a hydroponic business and possibly obtain a Land Bank property for this 
purpose.  Hydroponics is a way of growing plants in greenhouses. There are a 
couple of properties we have that may work for this.  The use would be considered 
a commercial or agricultural use.  The Land Bank Members were open to the idea 
of allowing this type of use on a Land Bank property.  They would also like additional 
information on the potential business.  
 
4) FINANCIAL REPORT  
  
The financial report was given by Brown.  The current balance is $11,113.27.  Motion 
by Poltera, seconded by Thompson to approve the financial report, passed 
unanimously.   
 
Brown said he has checked on waiving the cost for the Land Bank to file deeds and 
he will have more information at a future date.   
 
5) PROPERTY REPORT  
 
a. Bid Opening for 2020 Mowing Season 
 
  
Hvitløk said there are three bids: 
    
Warnken Enterprises   $390   
    
New Beginnings           $500 
    
Sisk Lawn Care            $331 
  
   All bidders are current on their taxes. 
2 
 
 
Warnken has mowed Land Bank lots in the past and does mowing for the Inspection 
Department.  Poltera said she would be willing to let Sisk try because he is the 
lowest bid.   
 
Thompson recommended going with Sisk, seconded by Brown, passed 
unanimously. 
 
6) OLD BUSINESS 
 
a. Application for Right of First Refusal – 19-LBP-05 – 214, 216, 218 West 6th Avenue 
 
Seitnater said City Attorney, Paul Brown, has reviewed the document. Thompson 
said the contract should have wording that allows the original applicant to walk 
away from the property if they do not develop it; however, they would not be 
refunded their payment. 
 
Seitnater said Daniel Smith is no longer interested in purchasing the lots at 539 and 
541 East Avenue A.  
 
Thompson will send a draft of amended wording to the Land Bank members 
tomorrow. 
 
Sue moved that we accept the Application for Right of Refusal letter with proposed 
amended changes, second by Brown, passed unanimously. 
              
7) NEW BUSINESS 
 
a.  Offer to buy – 20-LBP-02 – 712 South Maple or 824 East 7th Avenue (2nd choice) 
  
Seitnater explained the Hutchinson Land Bank acquired the lot located at 712 South 
Maple at the 2017 Reno County Tax Sale. The cost was $1,109 and this lot is the 
largest Land Bank property.  The Land Bank has invested $980 in mowing costs since 
2018.  This property is 118 feet wide and 149 feet deep.  The zoning is R-6. 
 
The second choice property at 824 East 7th Ave was recently acquired at the 2019 
Reno County Tax Sale and there have been no mowing charges to date.  This lot is 
48 feet wide and 140 feet deep.  The zoning is R-6. 
 
Nancy Moreno submitted an application to purchase the lot located at 712 South 
Maple to build a single-family house.  She has offered a price of $1,760.  She has 
also offered $640 for the lot at 824 East 7th Ave as a second choice. 
 
A single-family house is suitable for the R-6 Residential Infill District.  The location on 
Maple Street is highly visible on a street used to access Carey Park to the south and 
is adjacent to the Interfaith Housing Southern Pines development.  The proposal 
3 
 
would meet the Land Bank’s goals of strengthening and improving Hutchinson 
neighborhoods and returning a vacant lot back into productive use.  The applicant’s 
offer of $1,760 conforms with the Board’s purchasing policy. 
 
Staff recommends approval of application 20-LBP-02 to purchase the lot located at 
712 S Maple for $1,760 contingent on approved building plans and design review 
compatible to the Southern Pines development, or accept offer of $640 for the lot at 
824 East 7th as an alternate choice contingent on approved building plans and design 
compatible to the existing neighborhood. 
 
The Land Bank members would like some type of documentation showing what she 
would like to do and a timeline for completion prior to signing paperwork for sale of 
the lot.  They would be in favor of her developing either lot.  
 
b. Approval of Marketing and Director’s Insurance Policy Renewal 
  
 
 This is liability insurance for the Land Bank.  Motion by Thompson, seconded by 
Brown to renew the policy, passed unanimously.   
 
8) OTHER 
a. The next Land Bank Board of Trustees meeting is yet to be determined. 
b. The meeting was adjourned at 3:40 p.m.

since 2019,

PROPOSAL: 
An application to purchase the lot located at 539 East Avenue A was submitted by next door 
neighbor David C. Nafzinger in late April, 2020 (Exhibit 1). They intend to purchase the adjacent 
property at 539 East Avenue A for a side lot and has offered to purchase the property for $600.  
 
ANALYSIS: 
The proposed use is suitable for the R-6 Residential Infill District. The proposal would meet the 
Land Bank’s goals of strengthening and improving Hutchinson neighborhoods and returning a 
vacant lot back into productive use.  The applicant’s offer of $600 is below the Board’s 
purchasing policy on Pricing which states: 
 
The starting asking rate for all Land Bank property will be 50% of the 
market value ($1,300) of the property, as determined by the Reno 
County Appraiser. The Board may accept offers that are lower than 
the asking price rate by an amount of up to 10% 
 
RECOMMENDATION: 
Staff recommends denial of application (20-LBP-03) to purchase the lot located at 539 East 
Avenue E for $600 at this time in hopes of a higher future use for the property.  Or offer Mr. 
Nafzinger a higher counter offer.   It’s my thought that wiith the addition of the donated lot at 
541 East Avenue A to the East a more desirable outcome might be to hold out for a higher 
density in-fill build on the two properties in the future. 
 
NEXT STEPS: 
1. The applicant will be notified of the decision of the Land Bank Board of Directors. 
2. If the Board decides to approve the application, staff will begin to process transfer of 
ownership to the successful applicant. 
3. If a counteroffer is determined to be best strategy by the Land Bank the staff will work 
with guidance from Land Bank to enter into any further negotiations with Mr. Nafzinger.
