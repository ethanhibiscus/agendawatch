Special Density Allocation permit from Fairplains Church updated: Danny Long recused

Mr. Church explained that they received approval previously but have altered the plans and 
changed the impervious surface allowance to accommodate the update plans. The Church is also 
looking to do underground detention. He added they have reconfigured the entrances to be safer 
and done other slight modifications to the plans to meet all requirements. Otis Church asked 
about the underground detention. Justin Church explained NCDOT will accept the overflow 
from the proposed new underground detention system. Otis Church asked what the capacity was 
of the new stormwater system. Justin Church explained after the 1st inch of rainfall it will slowly 
release over a period of time to NCDOT’s stormwater system along Sparta Road. Ron Queen

updates will be brought to the board as they come available.

TOWN OF NORTH WILKESBORO 
PLANNING BOARD STAFF REPORT 
 
 
DATE OF HEARING: June 11th – 12th, 2020 
 
APPLICANT: Lucrecia Ramirez  & Ana Elizabeth Ramirez 
 
PROPERTY LOCATION: 1035 Mountain View Road 
 
PIN(s): 3960-80-4598 
 
Parcel ID #: 1200648 
 
ACREAGE: 1.14 Acres.  
 
REQUESTED ACTION:  Re-zone the 1.14 acre property from (R-10) Low Density to Rural 
Residential (R-20). 
 
DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL:  The property had a single wide manufactured home on the property 
and the owner was permitted to remove the existing manufactured home and replace it with a single 
wide manufactured home. Our Zoning Ordinance allows the replacement of manufactured homes if they 
are the same size and meet HUD standards.  Since the home was doubled in size it no longer can be 
considered a non-conforming structure.  Essentially the grandfathering of the structure and use on the 
property was lost and now must come into compliance with the current Zoning requirements for 
manufactured homes.  Currently R-20, Rural Residential is the only residential zoning district that would 
allow the installation of manufactured homes and does not regulate which size but does have installation 
conditions.  Those conditions include:  Article 11 Additional Conditions, 11.7-5 Manufactured home, 
Class A or Class B. (A) All homes shall be oriented to insure that the longer side is parallel, or as close 
as possible to the centerline of the public roadway, unless otherwise approved by the Zoning 
Administrator. (B) All homes shall have their entire perimeter enclosed from the ground to the bottom of 
the structure with material manufactured for this purpose in accordance with standards set by the State 
of North Carolina regulations for manufactured/mobile homes. Examples of commonly recognized 
building materials suitable for use as underpinning shall include, but not be limited to, the following 
list: brick masonry, concrete block masonry; natural or synthetic stone masonry; or vinyl. Assemblies, 
products and materials manufactured expressly for the purpose of underpinning shall be installed in 
accordance with the manufacturers’ specifications (C) The towing tongue shall be removed, under 
skirted or screened with shrubbery. Such shrubbery shall be of a height to insure a total visual barrier 
of the towing apparatus and maintained. 
   
SURROUNDING LAND USE AND ZONING: Surrounding land uses are primarily residential in the 
Town’s Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ). There is a mixture of R-20, Rural Residential and R-10, Low 
Density zoned properties with Sherwood Forest subdivision established in the vicinity.  The property 
 
2 
immediately behind this property is zoned R-20, Rural Residential within our ETJ therefore this 
rezoning would not be considered spot zoning.  
 
ACCESS: Access is provided off Mountain View Road.  There is currently a driveway off Mountain 
View Road.  
 
SEWER AND WATER: Town sewer is not available as this property is within the ETJ.  Mulberry 
Fairplains Water Association services the area for water.  The property has septic capabilities.   
  
REVIEW CRITERIA: In reviewing and making recommendations on proposed zoning map 
amendments, the Planning Board shall consider the Land Use Plan, Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map.   
 
In regards to the consistency of the proposed zoning with the Town of North Wilkesboro Comprehensive 
Plan: the future land use plan sees this property as medium density residential.  Existing land uses 
within the general vicinity of the subject property are residential: low and medium density.  All of the 
surrounding properties are within our ETJ.    
 
The Future Land Use Map excerpt from North Wilkesboro’s Comprehensive Plan below. 
 
 
 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION:  Staff recommends the property be zoned Rural Residential (R-20).  
 
Statement of consistency and reasonableness: (Must be within the motion)  
The proposed rezoning is or is not consistent with the North Wilkesboro 25 Year Comprehensive Plan 
and all other applicable plans, because it results in the potential development of a residentially zoned site 
to continue as residence but change to be more rural in nature. The Planning Commission considers an 
affirmative vote to be reasonable and in the public’s interest.

City permit allowed a total of 4 bedrooms on the property. We did not know of the zoning classifications so based on the
permit we had we placed a 3-bedroom mobile home on the lot. When we went for our building permit, the town said 
differently, that the lot is not zoned for this type of mobile home and only allows 2 bedrooms.
