CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) ADVISORY WARNING
STAY SAFE, STAY HEALTHY, STAY HOME
The Contra Costa County Health Department has ordered individuals in Contra Costa
County to “shelter in place”.  The California Department of Public Health issued its
“Mass Gatherings Guidance on Novel Coronavirus or COVID-19” followed by a
recommendation that certain gatherings in California be postponed or canceled.  The
Governor of the State of California issued Executive Order N-25-20 which, among other
things, orders that all California residents are to “. . . heed any orders and guidance of
state and local public health officials, including but not limited to the imposition of social
distancing measures, to control the spread of COVID-19” and pursuant to Executive
Order N-33-20 has ordered all individuals in California to stay home or at their place of
residence with very limited exceptions. That means residents must obey State, County,
and City of Concord rules and guidelines.
City of Concord Rules:  The City of Concord has declared a local state of emergency
due to COVID-19 and is closed to the public. This Concord Design Review Board
