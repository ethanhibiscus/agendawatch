7. 230TH AVENUE AND 55TH STREET INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS – 
KDOT AGREEMENT:  John Braun, Project Manager, stated in 2013, Ellis 
County applied for and was awarded Economic Development funding from 
Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) in the amount of $1.5M for 
improvements to the intersection of 230th Avenue and 55th Street just north of I-
70 Exit 157.  The proposed development of the Hays Truck Plaza Project 
prompted the annexation of property and right of way in the area of the Economic 
Development Project. In December 2019, the Ellis County Board of 
Commissioners requested that project sponsorship be transferred to the City of 
Hays.  Because KDOT funds are involved, it is necessary for the City of Hays to 
manage this project. The City’s role in this project is only management and 
oversight. 
 
At the May 14, 2020 City Commission Meeting, Tax Increment Financing 
(TIF), Community Improvement District (CID) creation, and a Development 
Agreement were approved in support of the truck plaza and the 230th Avenue 
and 55th Street Project. The Economic Development Project covered under the 
KDOT Agreement includes grading, pavement, curb and gutter, storm sewer, 
sidewalk, and pavement markings to improve 230th Avenue from just north of the 
westbound I-70 ramps to approximately 1300 feet north of the intersection with 
55th Street; and 55th Street from 230th Avenue to approximately 800 feet east. 
 
To formalize the responsibilities of both the City of Hays and the 
Department of Transportation, KDOT has provided an agreement to be executed 
by the Mayor and the Secretary of Transportation. Mr. Braun reviewed the key 
elements of the agreement.  
3
 
Construction is scheduled for 2021. The City of Hays has no monetary 
contribution to this project.  Any costs exceeding the $1.5M KDOT grant will be 
covered by D & J Land Development, LLC, under the Development Agreement. 
 
Mason Ruder moved, Sandy Jacobs seconded, to authorize the Mayor to 
enter Agreement No. 121-20, with the Kansas Department of Transportation for 
the 230th Avenue and 55th Street Project.  
 
Commissioner Mellick asked if the project would be completed in one 
construction season. Mr. Braun stated other projects in that area may overlap, 
but the KDOT project is to be completed in one year.

8. ORDINANCE TERMINATING THE HOME DEPOT TRANSPORTATION 
DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (TDD):  Kim Rupp, Director of Finance, stated the 
current Home Depot Transportation Development District includes Home Depot, 
IHOP, Hampton Inn, Town Place Suites by Marriott, and JT Travel Plaza.  A ¾% 
TDD sales tax in that district has been in place since April 1, 2005 garnering 
approximately $3.2M for Phase 1 and a portion of Phase 2 improvements in that 
area. The ¾% outperformed initial projections and therefore the 2004 TDD bonds 
financing the Phase 1 improvements were called early and completed in January 
2018 saving approximately $356,000 in interest costs. Most recently the 
Commission approved a portion of Phase 2 improvements which included 
extending East 41st Street past Home Depot to the Vineyard Park entrance. That 
project is now complete and the TDD sales tax collected since the payoff of the 
TDD bonds was sufficient to reimburse the capital projects fund for the 
improvements. Therefore, it is now time to terminate the Home Depot 
Transportation Development District thus ending the ¾% TDD sales tax by 
passage of an ordinance. He clarified that the TIF still remains. Those bonds are 
being paid by the City’s portion of the tax increment financing as well as a ½% of 
4
the City’s general fund sales tax in that district. Those bonds are scheduled to be 
paid out in 2024. 
 
Michael Berges moved, Ron Mellick seconded, to approve Ordinance No. 
3985 terminating the Home Depot Transportation Development District and TDD 
Sales Tax. 
 
Mayor Musil clarified that when this TDD sales tax is terminated the sales 
tax will go down in this district .75 cents, and will go up .50 cents when the 
County sales tax begins October 1, 2020.

9. NORTH VINE STREET CORRIDOR PROJECT – AUTHORIZING GENERAL 
OBLIGATION BOND FINANCING:  Kim Rupp, Director of Finance, stated as the 
North Vine Street Corridor Project gets underway, and due to the fact that 
expenditures up to this point have already occurred, it is necessary to authorize 
general obligation (GO) bond financing for these improvements by adopting a 
resolution.  
 
The main trafficway act K.S.A. 12-685 allows for financing certain main 
trafficway improvements with GO bonds using a two-step process. The first step 
involves designating the streets as main trafficways. The City has previously 
designated the subject streets within the City as main trafficways in the North 
Vine project.  The second step of the process involves adopting a resolution 
authorizing GO bond financing for the project. Pursuant to an agreement 
previously entered into between KDOT and the City, KDOT will administer 
construction of the project, and the City will provide a portion of the financing in 
the estimated amount of $7,111,000. The City plans to initially pay such costs 
with available funds from Capital Projects and will later be reimbursed with 
proceeds of GO bonds, which are expected to be issued in late 2020 or early 
2021. At such time, the Commission will consider an ordinance authorizing the 
5
issuance of the GO bonds. The debt service for that issue will come from the 
Transient Guest Tax. 
 
Ron Mellick moved, Michael Berges seconded, to approve Resolution No. 
2020-012 authorizing general obligation bond financing for the main trafficway 
projects.

11. COMMISSION INQUIRIES AND COMMENTS: Mayor Musil stated that he 
hopes the community will continue to support the businesses on North Vine 
Street as the North Vine Street Corridor Project construction begins.  
 
Vice-Mayor Jacobs agreed and she thanked John Braun, Project 
Manager, for everything he has done to keep the project going smoothly.  
 
Mayor Musil stated he appreciates the County Health Department relaxing 
some of the Covid-19 restrictions, and he believes the public will still do the right 
thing and follow the CDC guidelines.  
 
The meeting was adjourned at 7:20 p.m.

2020 Well Rehabilitation – Water Production – Award 
of Bid 
 
Person(s) Responsible: Jeff Crispin, Director of Water Resources 
 
 
 
Summary 
Staff solicited bids for the 2020 Well Rehabilitation Project to perform maintenance on 
specific production wells.  Bids were submitted by 5 contractors, with the lowest cost bid 
from Downey Drilling of Lexington, NE in the amount of $65,021.00.  Staff recommends 
awarding the bid and funding the cost out of the Projects Line Item in the Water 
Production and Distribution Budget. 
 
Background  
The CIP within the 2020 Budget includes $80,000.00 for a project to hire a professional 
well service company to inspect, evaluate, and perform maintenance on specific City 
owned production wells.  City staff performs routine maintenance on wells by acidizing 
the wells in an effort to improve performance.  This routine maintenance is performed 
until City Staff can no longer improve the performance of the well.  After attempts to 
improve performance are no longer working, it is required to hire a contractor for a more 
extensive procedure. 
 
A project form was completed as part of the 2019 and 2020 Budgets and will be repeated 
each year there after to complete professional maintenance on specific wells as needed.   
 
Total City Owned Wells

(S.W. of Hays) 
8 City  
 
(Hays) 
6 Remediation  
(Hays) 
5 Emergency  
(Hays) 
37 Total    
 
In 2019, 4 Smoky wells and 2 City wells were professionally rehabilitated by Layne 
Christensen at a cost of $67,230.  If awarded, Downey Drilling will rehabilitate 5 Smoky 
wells and 1 City well. 
 
Discussion 
Years of use cause the buildup of minerals to form on the screen at the bottom of the 
production wells.  This buildup reduces the amount of water that can be pumped to the 
8
surface.  Water Resources staff maintains the production of the wells by acidizing them.  
This process is not as extensive as a contractor’s method.  Rehabilitating wells extends 
the life of each well, reduces electricity, and the costs to produce water.   
 
The contractor will be required to pull the pumps for inspection and make repairs as 
needed.  A camera will be lowered into the well to inspect the screens at the bottom of 
the well.  High pressure jetting, chemical treatment, and mechanical methods will be used 
to clean the screens and mineral formations at the bottom of each well.  Once complete, 
the well will be performance tested and its efficiency compared to “like new”.   
 
Bids were opened on May 5, 2020 from 5 contractors listed below: 
 
Downey Drilling 
 
$65,021.00 
Layne Christensen 
 
$68,730.00 
Sargent Drilling 
 
$70,560.00 
Grosch Irrigation 
 
$71,730.00 
Clarke Well 
 
 
$97,236.00 
 
Downey Drilling of Lexington, NE submitted the lowest bid at $65,021.00.  Downey 
Drilling’s bid is below the budgeted number of $80,000.00.   
 
Legal Consideration 
There are no known legal obstacles to proceeding as recommended by City Staff. 
 
Financial Consideration 
This project was listed on the CIP within the 2020 budget in the amount of $80,000.00 to 
be funded out of the Projects Line Item in the Water Production and Distribution Budget.  
The total cost of the project is $65,021.00.  
 
Options 
The City Commission has the following options: 
1. Accept the low bid from Downey Drilling. 
2. Direct Staff to another option. 
3. Do nothing. 
 
Recommendation 
Staff recommends awarding the bid to Downey Drilling in the amount of $65,021.00. 
 
Action Requested 
Authorize the City Manager to execute a contract with Downey Drilling in the amount of 
$65,021.00 for the 2020 Well Rehabilitation Project to be funded from the Projects Line 
Item in the Water Production and Distribution Budget.

Exhibit A: Project Scope 
Project Description 
This project consists of hiring a professional well service company to inspect, 
evaluate, and perform maintenance on City production wells.  The contractor will pull 
the pumps for inspection and make repairs as needed.  A camera will be lowered into 
the well to inspect the screens at the bottom of the well.  Chemical treatment, and 
mechanical methods will be used to clear the screens and formations at the bottom of 
each well.  Once complete, the well will be performance tested and its efficiency 
compared to “like new”.  For example, a well that was performing at 80% is now 
performing at 97%. 
 
Wells to be completed in 2020: S-14, S20, C-28, S-21, S-22, and S-11.

Summary 
The Department of Water Resources is continuing its multi-year program to clean 
sanitary sewer mains to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the collection 
system.  Staff received 3 proposals for the 2020 program and recommends accepting the 
low bid to perform light cleaning and video inspection of 110,547 linear feet (21 miles) 
of sanitary sewer at the price of $94,614.25 from Pipe Detectives, with a budget authority 
not to exceed $130,000.  The 2020 program consists of performing the 2015 area again 
and continue the 5-year cleaning cycle.   
 
Background  
The Department of Water Resources has a goal of cleaning 20+ miles of line per year 
annually using a professional contractor.  Problems that can be caused by the lack of 
sewer cleaning include sewer backups, manhole overflows, public exposure to raw 
sewage, and regulatory fines.  
 
Video inspection has also been required as part of the cleaning contract. This helps to 
provide early detection of issues with infrastructure.  Previous CCTV inspections has 
produced records of abandonments (areas where a camera could not get through), cracks, 
holes and tree root issues. The video has been processed by I.T., the Department of Water 
Resources, and the Office of Project Management to create point repair and lining 
projects. City crews perform root removal and chemically treat lines on the problem areas 
notated on video.  The goal has been to create a baseline video of all sewer lines since the 
program started to maintain a record of this asset. Staff has been be able to go back and 
compare baseline with current conditions to see if flaws are changing and require 
additional repair. 
 
Discussion 
Staff sent RFP’s to 9 firms for contract sewer cleaning and CCTV inspection.  Staff 
opened 3 proposals from the following bidders, Mayer Specialty Service, LLC, Pro Pipe, 
and Pipe Detectives.  The proposals cover the cleaning and video inspection of 110,547 
linear feet (21 miles) of the City’s sewer line. 
36
The low bid for the sewer cleaning and video inspection contract was from Pipe 
Detectives with a bid of $94,614.25 for light cleaning of sanitary sewer lines.  Staff is 
recommending the proposal from Pipe Detectives for light cleaning of 110,547 linear feet 
at $94,614.25 to include video inspection.   
 
In addition to the approval for Pipe Detectives to perform light cleaning at $94,614.25, 
staff is requesting authority to spend up to $130,000.  The additional authority would 
cover medium and heavy cleaning where needed, protruding tap intrusion removal, root 
removal, and when needed; small, medium, and large patches.  The Capital Improvement 
Plan in the budget for this project lists this project at $150,000.  The request to spend up 
to $130,000 has been changed from $150,000 due to historical spending. 
 
If awarded the crew, equipment, and Superintendent would be mobilized from North 
Dakota.  Work would commence and continue until the project is complete.   
 
Four references were contacted and work by Pipe Detectives was found to be favorable.  
Each stated they would work with Pipe Detectives in the future.  Additional discussions 
were held with the company’s Project Manager and the General Manager.  Pipe 
Detectives typically performs work in the northern United States.  The climate up north 
does not allow for extended cleaning seasons and they are interested in performing work 
further south and the Kansas climate is ideal.  Staff is comfortable proceeding with Pipe 
Detectives.

a. ASTM F2561-16 is the standard practice for the rehabilitation of the 
main and its connection to a sewer service lateral using a one-piece 
main and lateral CIPP liner. 
b. This practice covers requirements and test methods for the 
reconstruction of a sewer service lateral pipe having an inner diameter 
of 3 to 12 in. (7.6 to 30.5 cm) and its connection to the main pipe 
having an inner diameter of 6 to 24 in. (15.2 to 61.0 cm) and up the 
lateral a maximum of 150 ft without excavation. The lateral pipe is 
accessed remotely from the main pipe and from a lateral access point. 
This will be accomplished by the installation of a resin impregnated 
one-piece main and lateral cured-in-place lining (MLCIPL) by means 
of air inflation and inversion. The MLCIPL is pressed against the host 
pipe by pressurizing a bladder and is held in place until the thermoset 
resins have cured. When cured, the MLCIPL shall be a continuous, 
one-piece, tight fitting, corrosion resistant lining extending over a 
predetermined length of the lateral pipe and the adjacent section of the 
main pipe, providing a verifiable non-leaking structural connection 
and seal.  The structural, one-piece connection lining extends over a 
12-inch minimum length section of the mainline and into the lateral for 
a predetermined length (6-inch minimum). 
 
1.5 
A daily log shall be maintained to record the location of the manholes and sewer 
lines, lengths of the lines cleaned, method of cleaning, lines sizes, identify type of 
cleaning (light, medium, or heavy), and type of debris removed. Observations are 
to be recorded on a cleaning report form provided by contractor. 
1.5.1 Contractor to update the Project Manager on the status of the project 
via email each Friday.  
1.6 
The purpose of this project is to complete the cleaning of all identified lines and 
restore each line segment to a minimum of 90% of its original carrying capacity.  
1.7 
The City requires television inspection data to be provided for import into Lucity, 
an asset management program. City will provide an export of a shape file 
including all lines, upstream and downstream manholes, ALT ID’s, streets, GIS 
ID’s, pipe sizes and pipe materials that are included in the project. 
 
2 
PLANS 
2.1 
The City will provide maps or prints for sewers to be cleaned that are highlighted 
to identify their inclusion for this project. 
2.2 
The City will provide reference numbers for all manholes on the maps or prints 
for the purpose of the Contractor referencing on cleaning reports. 
 
3 
SCHEDULING AND EXECUTION OF THE WORK 
3.1 
The project performance period will be continuous from the start of project. 
3.2 
The City will give the Contractor a notice to proceed after the Contractor has 
submitted satisfactory insurance documents specified in section 6 of this 
document. 
60
3.3 
The City and the Contractor will establish a schedule that identifies the project 
itinerary that is mutually beneficial to both parties and will allow completion of 
the work within the project performance period. 
3.4 
Prior to the sewer cleaning operation, the City and Contractor will agree on a 
sewer cleaning sequence.  In general, the sewer cleaning process will proceed 
from the upper ends of each sewer basin to the lower ends. 
3.5 
The Contractor will work in a continuous fashion once the project is started. 
3.6 
Reasonable allowances, as mutually agreed upon by both the City and the 
Contractor, for weather and other occurrences outside of either party’s control 
will be reason to deviate from schedule and/or extend the performance period.

Subject: 
Airport Fuel Road Overlay – Change Order 
 
Person(s) Responsible:  John Braun, Project Manager 
 
 
Summary 
Staff is requesting approval for an asphalt overlay to rehabilitate the Airport Fuel Road.  
The storm sewer, grading, and asphalt overlay of the road would be accomplished by a 
change order to an existing contract with APAC for similar work on General Custer Road.  
The $94,188.48 cost of the change order is 100% reimbursable from the FAA.   
 
Background  
The 2020 Street Maintenance Program included the Chip Seal of the Airport Fuel Road at 
a cost of $12,820.50 to be funded out of Special Highway. The 2020 Street Maintenance 
Program also included a project to install storm sewer improvements and asphalt overlay 
on General Custer Road, east of the Chetolah Creek Water Reclamation Facility.  That 
project included very similar work and unit bid prices for the work necessary to rehabilitate 
the Airport Fuel Road.  APAC-Kansas, Inc. of Hays is the contractor for both the Airport 
Fuel Road Chip Seal Project and the General Custer Road Project. 
 
Discussion 
APAC has worked with the Office of Project Management to develop a Change Order to 
the existing contract for General Custer Road Rehab to add the improvements to the Airport 
Fuel Road.  The change order in the amount of $94,188.48 is attached to this memo and 
includes the following items of work: 
• Installation of one 12” storm sewer pipe crossing under the fuel road 
• Installation of a 20’ x 45’ concrete pad at the automatic gate touch pad 
• Patching of existing roadbed in several locations 
• 2” asphalt overlay  
• Grading, backfill and seeding 
 
If approved, APAC is ready to begin the work shortly after approval of the Change Order 
and in conjunction with the General Custer Project. 
 
The quantity of chip seal allocated for the fuel road would be underrun from the contract 
with APAC for Chip Seal. 
 
70
Legal Consideration 
There are no known legal obstacles to proceeding as recommended by City Staff. 
 
Financial Consideration 
The $94,188.48 cost to rehabilitate the fuel road under the proposed change order is 
reimbursable 100% by the CARES Act grant from the FAA.  The $12,820 reduction in 
chip seal costs would be made available for other Special Highway funded uses. 
 
Options 
The City Commission has the following options: 
1. 
Authorize the City Manager to sign the change order; 
2. 
Direct Staff to another option; 
3. 
Do nothing. 
 
Recommendation 
City Staff recommends approving the change order. 
 
Action Requested 
Authorize the City Manager to execute the change order in the amount of $94,188.48.

Airport Apron and Pavement Marking Project –  
Award of Bid 
 
Person(s) Responsible: Jamie Salter, Director of Hays Regional Airport 
 
 
Summary 
Bids were received for the rehabilitation of the North Terminal Apron and removal and 
replacement of various pavement markings at the Hays Regional Airport. The bid was 
presented as two base bids with two alternates, and all are eligible for 100% funding 
through the FAA. The low bid for the Base Bids 1 and 2, plus Alternates 1 and 2, came 
from Vogts Parga Construction of Newton, KS, in the amount of $1,031,019.10. 
 
Background  
The Airport Terminal Apron was constructed in approximately 1990 and has had only 
minimal maintenance since that time. There are areas of concrete failure and drainage 
issues. Therefore, rehabilitation of the pavement is necessary. Recent inspections and 
correspondence with the FAA have ranked this project as a priority, and the FAA has 
indicated they intend to fund the project. 
 
Since 2010 the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) has included a project to rehabilitate the 
Apron and correct drainage issues at the Hays Regional Airport. The project has been 
identified for 2020 and is eligible for FAA funding.  
 
In October 2018, staff came before the City Commission and received authority to enter 
an agreement with Burns and McDonnell Engineers (BMcD), the City’s Airport 
Engineering Consultant under the Master Service Agreement, for design of the project. 
 
During the design process, staff identified pavement markings requiring removal and 
restriping due to a recent marking standard regulatory change. The FAA approved 
including these at 100% Federal funding (Base Bid 2). Additionally, the pavement 
markings for the primary Runway 16-34 and Taxiway Connector M1 are deteriorated and 
require removal and restriping. These markings have been included as Alternates 1 and 2 
and are eligible for 100% Federal funding. 
 
Discussion 
Bids for the rehabilitation of the apron and the pavement marking restriping were opened 
on May 12, 2020. The bid documents were prepared with two base bids, plus two 
alternates. 
76
• Base Bid 1 includes removal and replacement of failed pavement panels, grading 
of new panels, and installation of trench drain. 
• Base Bid 2 includes the removal and restriping of pavement markings on various 
Taxiway M locations. 
• Alternate 1 includes removal and restriping of pavement markings located on 
Taxiway Connector M1. 
• Alternate 2 includes removal and restriping of pavement markings located on 
Runway 16-34. 
 
Bids were received from 3 contractors, with the lowest bid being from Vogts Parga 
Construction, with a total price for Base Bids 1 & 2, plus Alternates 1 & 2, being 
$1,031,019.10. 
 
The low bid price is above the Engineer’s Estimate of $934,703.00. However, the FAA 
agrees that the bids are valid. See the bid summary below. A detailed tabulation of bids is 
attached.

Vogts Parga Construction has completed past projects for the City including the 
reconstruction of 43rd and 45th Streets. A letter of bid recommendation from BMcD is 
attached. 
 
This project also requires a reimbursable agreement with FAA Technical Operations to 
turn off and on the runway navigational aids during construction. During the construction 
requiring the main Runway 16-34 to be closed (anticipated for 34 days), the navigational 
aids must be turned off and on daily. The reimbursable agreement, in the amount of 
$70,000, covers the cost for Technical Operations personnel to be on site. This is 
included as 100% eligible for funding through the FAA. 
 
The grant would also cover 100% of the construction engineering (inspection and other 
costs to complete the project). A separate agenda item covers the approval of a work 
authorization for BMcD to accomplish construction phase engineering services in the 
amount of $201,885. 
 
The contractor is allowed 65 calendar days to complete Base Bid 1, 10 calendar days to 
complete Base Bid 2, 4 calendar days to complete Alternate 1, and 20 calendar days to 
complete Alternate 2. Construction will have no impact on commercial air service and is 
phased to minimally affect aircraft and tenant operations. Portions of Base Bid 2, 
Alternate 1, and Alternate 2 work will be completed during nighttime hours to limit the 
impact on operating conditions as the main runway will need to be closed as well as the 
crosswind runway for short periods of time. Assuming the timely award of a grant by the 
FAA, construction would be completed before the end of 2020.

Runway 4-22 Lighting Rehabilitation – Award of Bid  
 
Person(s) Responsible: Jamie Salter, Director of Hays Regional Airport 
 
 
Summary 
Bids were received for the rehabilitation of the Runway 4-22 lighting at the Hays 
Regional Airport. The low bid came from L&S Electric LLC of Salina, KS, in the amount 
of $692,004. 
 
Background  
The Crosswind Runway 4-22 was completed in 2003 and included direct bury wiring for 
the runway edge lighting. Direct burial results in premature deterioration of cables, 
creates high maintenance costs for repair and replacement, and has a shortened lifespan. 
The runway lighting is nearing the end of its useful service life. Upgrading to a can and 
conduit system, utilizing LED lighting, will enhance airfield safety while reducing 
maintenance and energy costs in the future. The FAA has ranked this project as a priority 
and has provided notice of their intent to fund the project. See Attached Location Map 
 
In December 2019, staff came before the City Commission and received authority to 
enter a design agreement with Burns and McDonnell (BMcD) for this project.   
 
Discussion 
Bids for the rehabilitation of the Runway 4-22 lighting were opened on May 12, 2020. 
The bid documents were prepared to include the following: 
• New Medium Intensity Runway Lights (MIRLs) in cans and conduits 
• New Runway End Identifier Lights (REILs) 
• New Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPIs) 
• New lighted signs  
• New vault and regulators 
 
Bids were received from 4 contractors, with the lowest bid being from L&S Electric 
LLC, with a total price of $692,004. 
 
The low bid prices are below the Engineer’s Estimate of $809,030. See the bid summary 
below. A detailed tabulation of bids is attached.

L&S Electric LLC has completed past projects at the Hays Regional Airport under the 
FAA Airport Improvement Program to include lighting installation for Taxiway M and 
the main Runway 16-34. A letter of bid recommendation from BMcD is attached. 
 
This project also requires a reimbursable agreement with FAA Technical Operations to 
turn off and on the runway navigational aids during construction. During the construction 
requiring the main Runway 16-34 to be closed (anticipated for 20 days), the navigational 
aids must be turned off and on daily. The reimbursable agreement, in the amount of 
$40,000, covers the cost for Technical Operations personnel to be on site. This is 
included as 100% eligible for funding through the FAA. 
 
The grant would also cover 100% of the construction engineering (inspection and other 
costs to complete the project). A separate agenda item covers the approval of a work 
authorization for BMcD to accomplish construction phase engineering services in the 
amount of $171,175. 
 
The contractor is allowed 65 calendar days to complete this project. The crosswind 
runway will be closed for the duration of construction. The main runway will need to be 
closed for short periods of time while construction occurs within the safety area; 
however, commercial and other aircraft operations will continue during construction. Any 
work requiring the closure of the main runway will be completed at night and/or on the 
weekend to minimize the impact on operation conditions. Assuming the award of a grant 
by the FAA, construction would begin in early Spring of 2021. 
 
Legal Consideration 
There are no known legal obstacles to proceeding as recommended by City Staff. 
 
Financial Consideration 
All work for design, construction, inspection, FAA technical operations, and 
administrative costs is anticipated to be funded 100% through the FAA.

Summary 
Bids were received for the rehabilitation of the Runway 4-22 lighting at the Hays 
Regional Airport. Inspection and observation of the construction needs to be 
accomplished according to FAA guidelines to satisfy the terms of the grant funding, to 
assure proper adherence to the plans, and to ensure quality construction. The City’s 
Airport Engineering Consultant, Burns and McDonnell (BMcD), has presented a scope of 
services and fee to accomplish the required construction oversight and project 
documentation. The cost for said services is $171,175. 
 
Background  
The project to rehabilitate Runway 4-22 lighting requires the use of a qualified 
construction engineer. 
 
Discussion 
The amount of time and level of oversight needed for the inspection of this project 
exceeds the available resources of the City to accomplish in-house. Therefore, the 
services of a professional engineering firm are required. As the City’s Airport Engineer, 
BMcD has submitted Work Authorization No. 5 to accomplish construction phase 
engineering services. See Attached Work Authorization No. 5 
 
Per FAA requirements, a fee evaluation was performed. This was completed in-house by 
City staff. The first proposal from BMcD was $181,143. After negotiation, BMcD 
reduced the fee to $171,175, which is acceptable to the FAA. See Attached Fee 
Evaluation and FAA Negotiation Summary Letter 
 
Legal Consideration 
There are no known legal obstacles to proceeding as recommended by City Staff. 
 
Financial Consideration 
The cost for construction phase engineering service, to be provided by BMcD, is 
$171,175, and is eligible for 100% funding through the FAA.
