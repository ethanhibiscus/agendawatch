RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO RELEASE ENHANCED 
FEDERAL MEDICAID MATCHING FUNDS TO COUNTIES AND NEW YORK CITY 
 
WHEREAS, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress has enacted extraordinary measures to 
help states and localities with increased costs and lost revenue; and 
 
WHEREAS, a key action enacted by the federal government was a 6.2 percent increase in the federal 
medical assistance percentage (FMAP); and 
 
WHEREAS, Congress has used this mechanism to provide fiscal relief to states and their local 
government Medicaid funding partners to reduce the financial burden they often experience in an economic 
downturn; and 
 
WHEREAS, we understand the State of New York has already drawn down about $2.5 billion for the 
period January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020; and 
 
WHEREAS, under federal law a portion of these funds are required to be passed through to counties and 
New York City; and  
 
WHEREAS, we estimate the local share is about 20 percent; and 
 
WHEREAS, counties and New York City are struggling with higher costs associated with responding to 
COVID-19 and experiencing extensive revenue declines due to the shutdown of large swaths of the economy; 
and 
 
WHEREAS, in addition to mounting losses in local revenues, counties are also expecting significant 
cuts in state aid; and 
 
WHEREAS, many counties have enacted plans to reduce non-mandated expenses to the degree they can 
without sacrificing public health and safety; and  
 
WHEREAS, these expense reductions also require a review of the workforce, including layoffs; and  
 
WHEREAS, we project that each quarter of enhanced FMAP funding is worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars for counties and New York City; and 
 
WHEREAS, the State has been holding three years of similar enhanced FMAP payments owed to 
counties and New York City under the Affordable Care Act that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars; now, 
therefore, be it  
 
RESOLVED, that the County of Livingston, is requesting that the State immediately release the first 
quarter of enhanced Medicaid federal matching funds for the pandemic response to Livingston County to 
provide some partial fiscal relief to the current conditions; and be it further  
 
RESOLVED, we request that the State provide a timeline to all counties on the release of the enhanced 
federal Medicaid matching funds related to the Affordable Care Act that have been withheld for years and the 
likely mechanism on how these funds will be delivered to counties and New York City; and be it further  
 
RESOLVED, we understand the State is experiencing severe fiscal stress, as well, and we want to work 
cooperatively with the State to develop a plan on the release of the withheld federal enhanced Medicaid funds 
due to counties under the Affordable Care Act and future pandemic FMAP increased funding; and, be it further  
 
RESOLVED, that the Clerk of the Livingston County Board of Supervisors shall forward copies of this 
resolution to Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York State Legislature, the New York State Congressional 
Delegation, the New York State Association of Counties, and all others deemed necessary and appropriate.
