The Title VI Coordinator has made available at this meeting/hearing a voluntary Public Involvement Survey to collect 
demographic data to monitor and demonstrate St. Joseph County’s compliance with its non-discrimination obligations under 
Title VI and Federal Regulation 23CFR 200.9(b)(4), and more importantly, ensure that affected communities and interested 
persons are provided equal access to public involvement. Compliance is voluntary. However, in order to demonstrate 
compliance with the federal regulation, the information requested must be documented when provided. It will not be used 
for any other purpose, except to show that those who are affected or have an interest in proceedings, or the proposed 
project have been given an opportunity to provide input throughout the process.
