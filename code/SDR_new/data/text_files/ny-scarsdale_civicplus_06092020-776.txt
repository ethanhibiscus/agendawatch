Phase 1 Reopening – NY Forward 
 
“Today, we reached a milestone and have reopened in Phase 1 of the Governor’s 
NY Forward plan.  This milestone, while significant after over two months of restrictions, 
remains somewhat limited.  Permitted activities under Phase 1 include construction, 
wholesale trade, and manufacturing activities as well as curbside pickup of certain retail.  
Phase 1 is expected to lead to further openings in the coming weeks.  Phase 2 includes a 
broader opening of retail along with professional services, administrative support and real 
estate.  Personally, I am counting down the days until I can get a haircut in Phase 2.  In the 
meantime, I will continue to rock my throwback to the 1970s.  At least I take comfort in 
knowing that I am not alone in this extremely popular fashion trend. 
 
Returning to the more serious impacts of COVID-19 and NY Forward, the 
reopening has commenced and planning for future phases has also started.  Village has a role 
to play, particularly with respect to assisting our Village merchants to reopening and reviving 
their businesses.  There are Village codes and other requirements that local businesses must 
adhere to.  The Village is looking for ways to think out of the box to achieve flexible 
solutions to help local merchants succeed in the transition to post-COVID operations.  To 
that end, I have asked Trustee Veron to be the point person to work with Village staff, the 
Scarsdale Business Alliance and local merchants to see where creative solutions may assist in 
reopening of businesses.  I have to admit that, while eager to appoint Trustee Veron to this 
role, I really had very little to do with it – she had been rallying the various constituents for 
many weeks.  Trustee Veron’s energy, enthusiasm, intelligence, creativity and knowledge of 
our Village make her the ideal person for this role.  We look forward to this collaborative 
effort and the benefits that will come from this talented collective group.  
 
Our progress reaching Phase 1 of NY Forward has been a direct result of our 
vigilance in following the Governor’s Executive Orders.  Our future progress remains in our 
hands.  Please continue to social distance, wear a face covering, wash your hands, and help 
your neighbors, especially those most at risk. Perhaps most importantly, stay home when you 
are not feeling well. We remain in this together and all of our actions matter – they 
determine the future path we will face.  
 
EMS Week 
 
Last week was Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Week. Scarsdale Volunteer 
Ambulance Corps (SVAC), which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, has always 
delivered exemplary care but they have never been more critical to our community than they 
have since the onset of this pandemic. SVAC's volunteers are residents of Scarsdale and its 
neighboring communities. These men and women are models of selflessness and Scarsdale’s 
motto of non sibi.  
Many in the community mistakenly believe that SVAC is funded by the real estate 
taxes we pay to the Village. This is false. SVAC is primarily run on the generous donations of 
Scarsdale’s residents through tax deductible donation. In a typical year, SVAC relies upon 
such donations to respond to approximately 1,500 emergency calls.

Thank you hardly seems enough for the life-saving work of our EMS workers, and I 
would like to offer a way we can demonstrate our gratitude to our treasured ambulance 
corps, now and every year during SVAC’s annual fund drive.  
To learn more about SVAC or to make a much-needed contribution, please visit: 
http://www.scarsdalevac.com. Donations may also be made by mailing a check to SVAC, 
P.O. Box 92, Scarsdale, NY 10583. Thank you in advance for supporting our ambulance 
corps.  
 
To all of our EMS workers and your families, thank you from the bottom of our 
hearts. Your sacrifice and dedication have helped our community immeasurably over the 
past 50 years and never more so than today. Scarsdale and each of its residents owe you an 
immeasurable debt of gratitude. 
 
Pedestrian Safety 
 
As we approach June and the weather continues to improve, please be cautious when 
driving, walking, running or bicycling.  Our streets are busier than usual with more people at 
home.  Also, as we are in Phase 1 of NY Forward, there will be increased vehicular traffic 
and more construction and landscaping vehicles parked on our roadways.  Please slow down 
and remain aware of your surroundings as you travel around the Village. 
 
Celebrations and Remembrances 
 
This is a season of celebrations and remembrances, including Memorial Day as well 
as college and high school graduations.  Each of these events has been muted this year.  Yet 
we have seen creative community and family approaches to celebrate the achievements of 
our daughters, sons, students, friends and neighbors.  Scarsdale High School teachers 
paraded past each senior’s house and posted Class of 2020 signs with car horns blaring and 
teachers cheering.  I have seen many families have similarly creative celebrations for the 
Class of 2020.  While this is no substitute for Senior Options, Prom and Graduation, it is 
heartening to see people celebrating the achievements of our Senior Class. 
 
We have seen similar sacrifices and family creativity for graduating college seniors.  
To Scarsdale’s graduating classes of 2020 – this marking of your major achievement is not 
taking place as anyone would have expected, but please know that we remain so proud of 
your achievements and your future remains bright – even if may take a little longer to get 
started. 
 
Lastly, Memorial Day was celebrated yesterday.  While it wasn’t the celebration we 
are accustomed to, we still took time to recall the adversity this country has faced throughout 
its history and we remembered the strength and unity we have repeatedly displayed. We 
think of those who have lost loved ones and their sacrifice, and we thank them for their 
service to our nation. We remember the significant price paid by those who preserved our 
freedom – freedom that we can have greater appreciation for as a result of the current 
restrictions that we are using to fight COVID-19.

While we are still firmly in the grasp of this pandemic, we must continue to have 
hope – hope for health, safety, and freedom. We will come out of this together as a stronger 
community and country.  
 
Please take care of one another, continue to do your part to stem the tide of this 
disease, and be well.”

Manager’s Comments 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo echoed the Mayor’s comments as they relate to the 
Memorial Day ceremonies   He stated that it's very good news that the Governor has seen 
fit, and the County worked hard, and the municipalities to get to the point where we are in 
our phase one reopening.  It’s good news for many of our local retail establishments in the 
Village Center, the Heathcote Five Corners and the Golden Horseshoe shopping center, 
who now can provide the same curbside pickup and delivery services that was previously 
tabbed for the so-called essential businesses that the Governor identified a few months back. 
Store retail operations are included in phase two of the governor's reopening plan included 
with the hair salons and all the other businesses in the Village.  That is going to be a really 
great time to celebrate and based on the way this Governor has been rolling out his 
reopening plan.  Every two weeks seems to be the time that he considers moving to the next 
step, so hopefully that continues and the full scale reopening of not only the retail 
operations, but hopefully in phase three, we get the restaurants back and we can start to 
really get back to some sense of normalcy on the commerce side. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that there are some other things he wanted to talk 
about us as it relates to COVID-19 and Village operations.   In regard to building, planning, 
and engineering, in preparation of construction activity fully returning as Friday, May 22nd 
which was this past Friday, the Village began accepting new building permit applications via 
drop box in front of the Village Hall which is being provided for during normal business 
hours from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, or the applications can be mailed.  Applications will be 
triaged and reviewed for building permit issuance or scheduled for a future land use board 
meeting.  The Planning Board and the Board of Appeals will restart public meetings this 
week and into June, and plan at this particular point in time to maintain their bi-monthly 
meetings.  Moving forward, building, planning, and engineering staff are communicating 
with applicants by phone and email.  Permits available for issuance include the gamut of 
building, plumbing, electrical, solar, storm water and erosion control permits, tree removal 
permits and street opening permits.  He referred the public to the Village’s website for more 
information.   There is a press release that is quite detailed and information can be found on 
the individual departmental web pages. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that the Assessment Department has also been 
very busy.   The tentative assessment role filing date and grievance periods are all coming 
due in June, and the roll will be published on or before June 1st consistent with the statutory 
dates.  He stated that residents should review their properties assessed value carefully, as it is 
the basis for the real estate taxes that they pay to the School District, County and the Village.  
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020

COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the State of New York largely preclude in-person 
viewing and inspection of the tentative role.  The Village will make the role available online. 
He stated that resident homeowners are afforded one opportunity per year to grieve their 
assessed values on Grievance Day which falls on the third Tuesday of June.  The Board of 
Assessment Review will meet on Tuesday, June 16th between the hours of 10:00 am to 
noon, 2:00 pm to 4:00pm, and 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm.  The meeting and discussions with 
property owners registered to present their case to the Board will be held remotely this year 
via zoom.  Requests for appointments must be made prior to 5:00 pm on June 12th by 
contacting the Assessor's office number at 722-1133, or by emailing the Assessor’s office at 
assessor@scarsdale.com.   Homeowners are encouraged to review the recent press release 
on the Village website for important dates and other information. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo continued, stating that “there is a lot happening with 
recreation program updates.  He stated that the Village government recognizes the physical 
and mental health benefits of recreation and has been working in collaboration with 
Westchester County officials to influence rules promulgated through NYS Executive Order 
such that we can safely open as many facilities, activities, and programs as possible under the 
existing COIVD-19 climate. Importantly, Executive Orders issued pursuant to a declared 
emergency carry significant legal weight and the Village has no discretionary authority, unless 
granted in the Order, to override or modify the State’s regulatory measures, which are 
grounded in the advice and counsel of public health officials. Rather, we are required to 
modify facility usage rules and make difficult decisions about canceling or delaying popular 
recreation activities and programs in order to remain compliant with the NYS mandates.  
 
Please note that the Village has been working diligently to expedite a return to some 
semblance of normalcy, including endeavoring to authorize as many recreational activities as 
the State will allow.  Some of our programs require significant advance planning and 
investment. In an uncertain regulatory environment, there comes a point where our planning 
horizon becomes so short that the investment necessary to successfully launch a program or 
activity that will likely be canceled becomes too great a financial risk, particularly in view of 
budgetary austerity measures already instituted in response to forecasted revenue declines.  
With that backdrop, the most difficult decision we made last week was to cancel our 
Summer Camps for all age groups as well as our Sports, Soccer and Teen Travel camps.  
However, we remain optimistic that our weeklong camps in August or sooner may still be 
offered.  Stay alert for future press releases and public announcements.” 
 
As for the Municipal Pool Complex, Village Manager Pappalardo stated that “we 
have extended our date to fully invest budgetarily in opening the Complex until June 8th for a 
July 18 opening providing for a shortened permit season.  Six weeks of advance planning 
and work, with a significant budgetary commitment, are necessary to support the proposed 
opening date. Thus, the pool season will be subject to cancelation if NYS or Westchester 
County Health officials are unable to provide a timely decision, or otherwise direct that 
public and commercial pools not open this year. If we are able to open, pro-rated pool 
permits will be made available for the shortened season.  Recreation Department staff is 
working on a short resident survey to determine the level of interest in such a shortened 
season.  In addition, due to the extended closure date, the Fireworks Spectacular scheduled 
for July 2nd, has been cancelled as well.

The good news however, is that Governor Cuomo has authorized tennis courts to 
reopen on a statewide basis, subject to certain public health mandates focused on social 
distancing and sanitization measures. In anticipation of this directive, Recreation 
Department maintenance crews have worked over the past few weeks to prepare the Har-
Tru and Hard surface courts, allowing for our ability to officially reopen these courts this 
past Friday. Village personnel have prepared an operating plan that responds to each of the 
requirements and are accepting court reservations online. Permit holders are required to 
make a reservation at least one day ahead of play. Tennis play is limited to residents and their 
registered guests and for singles play, only.  No doubles allowed. Players must check-in with 
the attendant before playing.  Face covering is required at check-in but is optional while 
playing. Reports received this weekend were that a number of residents neglected to wear a 
face mask at check-in.  All tennis permit holders are reminded to do so for everyone’s health 
and safety. All players are required to show a photo ID or tennis permit when checking-in as 
well.  As has always been the case, no lessons are permitted. Bathroom facilities will remain 
closed. A decision to prorate Village sponsored Tennis Lessons is anticipated on or about 
June 15th. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that the last thing he wanted to talk about this 
evening is the comprehensive Village reopening plan.  In response to the COVID-19 
pandemic and in adherence to the Governor’s various and applicable Executive Orders, the 
Village of Scarsdale enacted temporary emergency measures to limit and/or modify spending 
and operations focused on essential services relative to COVID-19 and the health, safety and 
welfare of the public and Village employees. As priorities and services are currently shifting 
to a phased reopening on a regional basis through State mandated protocols, the Village is in 
the process of implementing a reopening safety plan to maintain a healthy workplace for our 
employees and the public doing business with the Village while preventing the spread of the 
virus within the community. The purpose of the reopening plan is to provide guidance and 
to establish modified processes and procedures in response to COVID-19 and the 
Governor’s reopening plan, and in furtherance of the Village’s continued seamless and 
effective operations and customer service.  
 
The plan is for Village Hall, but will be translatable to other satellite buildings. Major 
topic headings include:  Implementing Employee Safety and Personal Preventative measures 
including PPE, Social Distancing, staggered work schedules and remote working to reduce 
people density as a safety measure; Daily documented health screenings with temperature 
and COVID-19 symptom checks and ongoing monitoring when necessary; Contact Tracing 
and disinfection of contaminated areas if necessary; Preparing the building to ensure proper 
social distance in workplace spaces, installation of sneeze guards at work stations located in 
common areas, installation of wall mounted hand sanitizers and personal safety signs on 
every floors, and other employee safety measures; Processes and procedures for Public 
access to the buildings and public safety measures, Controlled Access for safety purposes 
and Building cleaning protocols and schedules.   
 
A small working group of staff has been formed to draft the Plan which involves 
discussions with all department heads for their input and cooperation. Staff has participated 
in a number of webinars on this topic as well as peer discussions within the County. The 
Plan will be clearly communicated to the staff and public at the appropriate time to help with 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020

implementation success.  We have already begun making certain building safety 
enhancements and expect to have a final reopening plan in place next month.”

Mayor Samwick stated that the Village Board just prior to this meeting had a work 
session about real estate tax payments for the School District that the Village collects on 
their behalf, as well as discussing the Village tax payments.   He stated that Trustee spent an 
enormous amount of time on all this and worked closely with staff on it.  He then asked 
Trustee Arest to update everyone on this before moving to public comment.    
 
Trustee Arest stated that “in continuance of our commitment to try and do 
everything we can for our residents during this crisis, we had a joint Town and Village work 
session on splitting property tax payments for both the School and Village.  It appears there 
was consensus from the Board to move forward with both changes to our tax collection.  
Short term implications were discussed as were potential medium and long term impacts.  
While there may be additional burdens created by this change, at the least, the short term 
benefits for those who need them the most at this time clearly outweigh them.  While there 
is permanence involved with the changes, this Board is committed to monitoring impacts 
and reviewing them during next year's budget process.   
 
I should note a good deal of outreach will be required to ensure our residents 
understand the changes if and when adopted but, to summarize the expected changes as 
follows: 
 
School tax payments would now be due in two equal installments in September and 
in January instead of one payment in September as is currently structured  Village tax 
payments will also be due in equal installments in July (by August 1s)t and December instead 
of the current requirement of no later than August 1st for that entire tax liability.  There are 
additional costs associated with this change, including the use of lockbox services, bill 
redesign and printing costs, as well as possible software reprogramming charges.  Loss of 
interest revenue is nominal in the current interest rate environment, but could be more 
impactful in the future.  In regard to interest penalties, penalties on our residents are never a 
desired source of revenue but must be recognized as a line item in our budget.   While a 
potential shortfall created by a reduction in penalties should not prevent us from acting, we 
do need to be aware of the possibility and plan accordingly.  There is also a chance that 
creating a new payment structure could in fact result in more missed payments due to the 
introduction of a second installment.  That would be an undesired and unintended 
consequence. This will be monitored and part of the evaluation in 2021. 
 
Bottom line, if ultimately approved by the Board, which is expected, we hope this is 
a welcome benefit to many of our residents, especially during this unbelievably challenging 
time.  It is our intention to ensure this is in place for the current year, when obviously it is 
needed the most.  I should also note that we are proceeding under Section 925-A(2) of the 
New York Real Property Tax Law, which allows us during an emergency, to request a 21 day 
extension of the interest free tax collection window from the Governor for what is expected 
to be our first installment of Village taxes in July.  Our Village Manager will be sending that

request out tomorrow.  We are optimistic that it will be approved and hope to have more to 
report on this at our next Village Board meeting. Thank you.”

Public Comments 
 
At this time, Mayor Samwick stated that he would like to open the public comment 
section of the meeting.  He reminded people that there is a second public comment section 
on the agenda at the end of the meeting, and that will take place only to the extent that we 
get to that point by 10:00 pm 
 
Mayor Samwick then opened the public comment portion of the meeting. 
 
 
Robert Berg, 32 Tisdale Road, stated that he participated in the work session at 6:00 
pm this evening, but the Board did not allow public comment during that meeting.  
Therefore, he would like to make his comments about the two installment payment plans for 
the School and Village taxes now.  He stated that it's wonderful that the Village Board is 
suddenly all excited about implementing the two installment payment plans for both the 
School and Village taxes.  He stated that this was not even on the Board’s radar screen until 
he, and his colleagues Sean Cohen and Bob Selvaggio raised it in early April after they 
contacted Assemblywoman Amy Paulin and Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, seeking their 
assistance in obtaining tax payment relief for suffering residents.  Ms. Paulin wrote him 
explaining that the Village has the unilateral right to implement the two installments School 
text billing plan by adopting a resolution.  She advised him that she was told by the Village 
that it would incur substantial reprogramming costs for sending two bills and handling two 
payments. 
 
Mr. Berg stated that he then did a lot of legal research and other due diligence and 
discovered that every single town and city in Westchester has for many years adopted the 
two installment no penalty school tax plan so that the residents don't have to pay their 
school taxes all in one lump sum and they can split their payments which gives them a lot of 
cash flow flexibility and allows them to avoid the loan shark like late fee penalties.  He stated 
that he raised the issue for the School Board and administration over a month ago and 
explained how helpful this would be for the residents, but wanted to make sure it would not 
impact the School District in any material way.  The School Board took a look at it and the 
Assistant Superintendent for Business reported back that the impact on the School District 
would be a minimum one.  However, the Village told him that there would be likely 
substantial reprogramming costs and that the Village would likely have to hire a new 
employee to handle the additional billing duties. He stated that he told the School Board that 
that was really not true and that no Town sends out two bills.  They send out a single bill 
and with two payment coupons, one for each tax payment and most Towns did not even 
send a reminder. There are some that send an email reminder, but no one had to send two 
bills. 
 
Mr. Berg stated that School Board initially decided to table the issue for this year and 
intended to speak with the Village about it at a future joint meeting.  He stated that he told 
the School Board that the Village’s response concerning the additional costs was nonsense 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020

and then he wrote a strong letter emphasizing the benefits of the two installment plan to 
residents and urged them to help him convince the Village Board to do the right thing. A 
few days later at the School Board meeting, the School Board did just that.  The School 
Board adopted a resolution at their May 14th meeting and on May 12th to have the School 
Board President send a letter to the Mayor recommending that the Village implement the 
two installments payment plan.  At the Village Board’s work session this evening, the Board 
stated that the School Board should issue a resolution, however, they did that to get that 
letter to the Village Board. 
 
Mr. Berg stated that is deplorable that the Village had failed to offer this option to 
residents for years, like every other Town in the county does and he stated that raising 
Village revenues through these loan shark level penalties is a despicable practice.  The only 
people that can’t pay their property taxes on time are those who simply don't have the 
money. They are most financially vulnerable residents –the elderly and widows who are 
scraping by on social security and fixed incomes or folks who have lost their jobs when their 
businesses are suffering.  He stated that he disagreed with the Mayor's view that the penalties 
are fair because most residents pay on time.  With respect to Village tax, he stated that 
virtually every Village in Westchester County has already implemented the two payment 
installment plan.  He stated that the Board should also adopt this immediately.  
 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that he was a little bit distressed that Mr. Berg continues to 
refer to the penalties as loan shark-like. . As the Board has mentioned many times and at the 
at the work session that he attended earlier this evening, all penalties are stipulated by the 
State and County. They are not set by the Village in any way, shape, or form and their 
uniform. As a result, throughout the region. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that he wanted to clarify one misstatement in that Mr. Berg 
said that he, the Mayor had said earlier penalties are fair because most people pay on time. 
He stated that this is not what he said.  What he said was that it wouldn't be fair to those 
who do pay on time, if those who paid late didn't have some penalty associated with it, and 
it's really an equity ability argument; that's all he was saying in that regard.  
 
Randy Whitestone, 94 Sprague Road, stated that he appreciated the 6:00 pm Board 
of Trustees work session, and noted that it was an interesting discussion, although he felt 
that it would have helped to have had some public comment during that period.  He stated 
that he wanted to pick up on a couple of points made by Trustee Arest. 
 
Mr. Whitestone stated that one is that he thinks it is critically important to monitor 
what is going on with the payments on an ongoing basis and to communicate what is going 
on because this is a new endeavor. This is a first time that this is being done in the Village 
and it is important to understand the impact that it has.   
 
Mr. Whitestone continued, stating that the second thing that Trustee Arest said that 
he wanted to amplify was the importance of communicating and educating the community 
on what's going on with the with the changes to the payment schedule for both the Village 
and the school tax bills.  He stated that he thinks it is really important that people 
understand the change, that they're reminded of the change, and that there is a very clear 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
271 
 
sense of the timing and what they need to do – this is important to do since this is a big 
change. 
 
Lastly, Mr. Whitestone stated that he wanted to ask for a little further research on the 
Village side of the impact of this change as it relates to Village cash flow, because he felt it 
will be something that will need to be monitored and clearly there's going to be some 
revenue diminishing from other revenue lines in the coming budget year.  Cash flow is 
something that will be important to watch on a real time basis. 
 
Mayor Samwick noted that the Village Treasurer has looked at cash flow and has had 
discussions with her as has Trustee Arest, and she feels that it's a manageable situation.  
However, he stated that Mr. Whitestone has brought up a good point and he apologized that 
they didn't bring it up during the work session. 
 
Robert Harrison, 65 Fox Meadow Road, complimented the Mayor for all his 
comments and leadership.  He stated that he hoped that they can get the two payment 
installment for School taxes done and not delay, adding that he sent the Board an email this 
afternoon in that regard.  He stated that he attended the School Board meeting and they had 
a long discussion on the installment payment program.  He stated that the School Board is 
behind the program and he didn’t think this Board should need anything further from them.  
There's no reason to delay as the School Board is in favor of it, and he thought that most if 
not all of the Trustees are in favor of this.   The School Board sent this Board a letter, 
supported by 100% of the School Board members.  
 
Mr. Harrison complimented Village Manager Pappalardo and his staff for managing 
the Village in this difficult time. He thanked the staff for taking a pay freeze and helping with 
the budget.  He urged the School Board to do the same; he stated that he has not heard from 
them to it seems to be a secret as to what they're going to do, and the School 
Superintendent’s salary is substantially higher than the Village Manager’s salary. 
 
Mr. Harrison thanked Village Clerk Conkling for her hard work and asked whether 
or not parking permits were on the agenda this evening for discussion. 
 
Mr. Harrison complimented Bob Kaczmarek of the Recreation Department and 
Superintendent Briar Gray for their work on opening the tennis courts.  He stated that he 
and his wife played at 11:00 am Saturday morning at the Middle School tennis courts.  The 
young people working as attendants at the tennis courts are college students finishing their 
first year, high school students, and high school graduates. They're terrific and they're doing 
their job.  He stated that he thinks the Village is collecting some tennis court revenue since 
people have to have sign up for their permits, which he and his wife did, and he urged 
everybody in town to take up tennis as a lifetime sport. 
 
Mr. Harrison next complimented Trustee Arest, stating that he did a great job with 
his comments on the installment plan for School taxes.  He thanked Village Treasurer 
McClure for all the work she did on this; these items will be very helpful to the taxpayers 
during this difficult period and many have even had their incomes reduced, or lost their jobs.   
It’s a difficult time, and hopefully, things are going to get better.    
 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
272 
 
Mayor Samwick responded to Mr. Harrison’s question about parking permits, stating 
that it is not an agenda item this evening. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that it is not a Board item, but an administrative 
decision. 
 
Trustee Arest stated that an announcement regarding the extension of the parking 
permits was tweeted out and a press release was issued today.  He asked if the Clerk could 
take about this briefly as it would be helpful to the community 
 
Village Clerk Conkling stated that as most people know that purchase their parking 
permits every year, permit sales usually begin on June 1st for the July 1st valid date period. 
Staff was aware that most commuters haven't been using their permits and after some 
discussion and some surveys of other municipalities, a decision was made to extend the 
current permits that would normally expire on June 30th through to September 30th. So far 
the response from our current permit holders has been great, and it is helpful to extend the 
permit period in other ways.  When we do reopen, there won’t be a lot of people coming in 
to apply for permits and creating social distancing issues.  Additionally, it appears that there 
will be more of a need for parking permits in September/October.  We will begin accepting 
parking permit applications in September. 
 
Trustee Arest stated that in addition to a great tweet, a press release was issued 
through Notify Me.  The information is on the website as well, so any resident that may 
look. 
 
There being no further public comments, Mayor Samwick closed the first public 
comment section of the meeting at this time.

Trustee Liaison Reports 
 
 
Trustee Arest stated, “I previously mentioned evaluating potential changes to our 
code along varying time frames.  This should apply to challenges we might face and 
opportunities we may find as well.  In the short term, we are and must continue to act when 
necessary.  Examples of this include the changes to our budget and financial policies such as 
modifying the tax collection process, working under austerity measures and allocating 
existing funds to contingent accounts.  Uncertainty might make anything beyond short term 
planning difficult but does not mean it cannot or should not be done.   
  
This pertains to impacts on our Village residents’ individual and collective quality of 
life.  I was hoping that our Village Manager was going to mention, but I understand he had 
lengthy and very informative comments, a request to ask their landscapers to park off the 
street when possible in order to minimize street parking and potential disruptions. The 
Scarsdale Police Department would like to remind residents that as we move Forward (with 
a capital F) for New York Forward and enter Phase I, there is an expectation of increased 
vehicle traffic.  Please be aware when walking, jogging or cycling.  Of course, our gasoline 
powered leaf blower ban goes into effect June 1 and the Police Department has been 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
273 
 
distributing flyers on landscapers’ vehicles since mid-March reminding them that the law will 
be enforced. 
  
Reevaluating quality of life ordinances and finding the right balance between the 
needs of various stakeholders is rarely easy.  But, doing so might be more important than 
ever as our economy opens and we move towards a new normal.  As many of us, of all ages, 
spend more time in Scarsdale this summer, many of the noises and other nuisances that 
normally go unnoticed in our busy lives will be at the forefront.  My request to the 
community at this time is for patience and participation.  We need to be thoughtful in our 
approach and should consider the long-term ramifications of possible changes.  Therefore, 
please be patient. But, please participate by emailing the Mayor at 
Mayor@Scarsdale.com.  These e-mails find their way to the Board and relevant Village staff 
and will help guide us in determining what changes, in this case to our Code, might need to 
be made.  I will save ideas for a work session where the full Board, staff and the public will 
be able to have input.  The ability to make decisions for the here and now but also plan for 
the future is not unusual for this Board and Village Staff.  It is what we do and will continue 
to do.  This includes but is not limited to a Budget Work Session which will take place 
before our next board meeting.   
  
We need to ensure that our Village is prepared to get through and out of this health 
crisis, but we also need to act with foresight and show how Scarsdale can do this well and be 
a leader.  We want to ensure that our brand is strong today and into the future.    
As we exit what I hope will be the most restrictive part of this pandemic, we 
recognize that our decisions will set us on a course to shape the Scarsdale of today, 
tomorrow and of 2030 and beyond.   Staying the special place that Scarsdale has been into 
the future is what will keep our property values strong.  Thank you.”

              Trustee Veron stated, “I have two reports this evening. The first is on the 
library.  Director Beth Bermel is working with other local libraries and the Village to 
determine how to best follow State and County health regulations to phase in physical 
services in additional to digital services. Patron and staff safety is a priority as she is 
considering what services may be offered.  
 
            As I reported last meeting, virtual programs and activities continue for Scarsdale 
patrons.  Information can be found on the website and through other social media including 
Facebook, Instagram and emails.  Construction is continuing at 54 Olmsted Road. The 
workers are following safety guidelines and work is on schedule for late fall opening. 
 
Scarsdale Business Community 
 
            As I’ve been reporting since COVID hit, the Scarsdale business community has been 
pulling together. Merchants, property owners, the Scarsdale Business Alliance and 
government have convened on several occasions to discuss how best to navigate these 
challenging times. 
 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
274 
 
 
               As the Mayor reported, today was Westchester’s Phase One reopening and the 
expectation is that Phase Two and Phase Three won’t be far behind.  As long as our metrics 
hold, we can expect to see much more activity in our retail hubs in June.  To that end, we 
have begun to reimagine how to serve customers while providing safe and socially distanced 
experiences.  We are exploring a broader use of open space, creativity around sidewalks and 
streetscape, making the environment pedestrian, bike and roll friendly, among many other 
ideas.  We’re brainstorming with our partners - the library, rec department and others - to 
bring back community.  One idea is a drive in movie night, with the hopes of catering being 
provided by our local eateries.  We’re tracking the creativity around the globe, and our 
brainstorming to lift up all is just beginning!  I’ve already been receiving great suggestions 
from residents.  Please keep them coming. 
 
                What I ask of the community is to be flexible with us as we try a variety of 
options.  We will experiment and iterate, keeping paramount the safety and welfare of 
employees, merchants, consumers, Village staff and neighbors.  We will certainly get some 
things wrong, but we are hoping we get a lot right.  Our goal is for Scarsdale’s local 
businesses to generate the income they so desperately need, to deliver on the needs of their 
loyal customers, and to put all of our retail hubs on a path to renewal.”

Trustee Arest 
 
Trustee Arest reported on the statements of expense and revenue for the various 
funds of the Village for the first eleven months of fiscal year 2019-2020. 
 
General fund appropriations were 86.26% spent as of April, 2020 as compared to 
83.53% in 2018-2019.   
 
General Fund Revenues other than property taxes are $13,996,341 through April 
2020 compared with $14,080,089 in the first eleven months of last year.  This represents a 
decrease of $83,748 from 2018-2019.  Overall revenue from Special Assessments and 
Delinquent Tax collections increased $74,302.  Gross receipts taxes are down $37,850.  Sales 
tax receipts increased $365,400 reflecting the increase in the County Sales Tax rate that took 
effect in August.  Building Permit revenue (included in License and Permit category) 
increased $30,700 from last year.  Again, overall, (inclusive of building permits), License and 
Permit revenue is up $110,900.  The largest impacts in the Insurance Recovery and 
Equipment sales of $118,900 are in the reimbursement for special details which is up 
$17,100 from last year and the receipt of over $94,100 from Con Edison for paving 
reimbursement.  Parking revenue is down $125,700 as meter fees have dropped.   
Investment earnings declined $9,200 reflecting lower rates and longer maturities.  Recreation 
revenue dropped $207,400 as the spring activities were cancelled due to the COVID-19 
virus.  Departmental Revenue declined $147,600 since 2018-2019 was impacted by a late 
snow reimbursement and there was a significant drop in parking fines, also related to the 
COVID-19 virus and the need to shelter in place.  Mortgage Tax dropped $279,700, Court 
fines are down $219,000 and State aid is down $186,600 as New York State has changed the 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
275 
 
timing of the AIM related aid to the end of the fiscal years (Town and Village).  Revenue 
from property rentals is down $32,800. 
 
The actual collection of Village taxes through April, 2020 is at 99.68%.   This is 
down 9 basis points from last year’s collection rate. 
 
                                                         ******** 
 
In regard to Trustee Arest’s report on the Statement of Expense and Revenue for 
June 2019-April 2020, Mayor Samwick commented that the April actual revenues reflect a 
decrease in numbers exactly in the areas that staff had anticipated and the Board was 
involved in, in terms of putting together reserve funds against what we're seeing.  He stated 
that we are seeing parking revenue down, as people are not coming into the Village Center; 
we are seeing Court fines down as the Court is temporarily closed.  He stated that they do 
expect that they will make up a meaningful percentage of that when the Court reopens.   
 
Mayor Samwick continued, noting that Recreation revenue is down substantially, but 
it’s important to look at the net number and not to look at the at the gross revenue number 
because there's costs associated with every dollar of revenue there and it may not necessarily 
hold exactly true. But by and large, a general rule of thumb to utilize is that there's going to 
be about a 90% cost associated with every dollar of revenue so that the number that you'll 
see here is meaningfully higher than the actual impact to the Village and you'll see mortgage 
taxes dropped as well.  He stated that one thing that's important to also note is that sales 
taxes have not dropped; in fact they've gone up significantly and that's counterintuitive.  
What it really is it reflects two distinct factors; one, it reflects that the sales tax rate in 
Westchester County increased last summer and we are still continuing to see some of that 
impact coming through – the positive impact in that sales tax revenue. And number two, 
sales tax represents a little over 6% of our revenue and is the largest non-property tax 
category of our revenue.  What we have here is we have a timing issue. We have to recognize 
timing and what he means by that is that the payment we just received, and we're looking at 
this on a cash basis, reflects the end of December through the middle to end of March, 
period.  And therefore, it does not yet reflect what we know to be the case in terms of the 
latter portion of March, April and May.  So we will see the impact on that sales tax side but 
not yet at this point - that will happen over time.

Upon motion entered by Trustee Lewis, and seconded by Trustee Ross, the following 
resolution regarding Authorization to Execute a Temporary Construction Easement and Waive 
Parking Fees was approved by the vote indicated below: 
 
WHEREAS, the Village of Scarsdale is the owner of two properties used as 
commuter parking lots, one located at 14 Freightway, Scarsdale, 
Westchester County, NY, as shown on the tax map of the Village of 
Scarsdale, NY, as Section 1, Block 6, Lot 3 (“Grantor’s Property”), 
and the other at 0 Scarsdale Avenue, Scarsdale, Westchester County,

NY, as shown on the tax map of the Village of Scarsdale, NY, as 
Section 1, Block 6, Lot 5 (“Grantor’s Property”), also known as the 
Scarsdale Avenue Meter Lot; and  
 
WHEREAS, Metro-North operates the Harlem Line commuter railroad between 
New York City and Westchester, which is in need of maintenance 
and repair of two crossover tracks near the Interlocking Control 
Point south of the Scarsdale Station, proximate to the Freightway 
Surface Lot and Scarsdale Avenue Meter Lot, requiring use of 
parking spaces in each lot, as depicted in Exhibit A, for project 
staging and material storage; and 
 
 
WHEREAS, in view of reduced train service and associated commuter parking 
demands, as well as the cyclical summer slowdowns in commuter rail 
traffic, related to COVID-19, Metro-North wishes to advance and 
expedite the project in order to take advantage of the opportunity to 
complete the necessary work, anticipated to take between 10 to 12 
weeks to complete, while also minimizing local parking and 
commuter inconvenience, as briefly described in Exhibit B; and 
 
WHEREAS, it is in Scarsdale’s best interest to support Metro-North’s project 
objectives, including expediting local approval in order to minimize 
local parking and commuter impacts, and staff have negotiated a 
temporary easement declaration protecting our interests and duly 
authorizing the work to proceed, including a conditional waiver of 
parking space utilization fees; now, therefore, be it 
 
RESOLVED, that the Village Manager is herein authorized to execute a temporary 
easement agreement in substantially the same form as attached 
hereto, with Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, 420 
Lexington Avenue, 11th floor, New York, NY 10170, and to 
undertake any administrative acts as may be necessary, including 
waiver of parking space utilization fees, as per the terms and 
conditions of the temporary easement.

Trustee Arest questioned whether this agreement impacts the Village’s agreement 
with Propark in any way, in terms of monies that they may owe us and asked if it relieves any 
obligations on their part.  He also asked if the Village is concerned about any liability 
.  
Deputy Village Manager Cole stated that in monitoring the lot usage for Propark, 
they've been parking about 20 cars a day on average, so really the number of spaces that 
Metro- North plans to use is inconsequential in the overall scheme of available spaces. When 
it comes to liability, Metro-North is required to provide the Village with a certificate of 
liability insurance. And in addition to that, with respect to our own physical infrastructure 
and its condition and potential damage, both he and Jeff Coleman, the Public Works 
superintendent have taken a look at the site.   Jeff Coleman has gone back and photo 
documented conditions that are present, because although Propark is responsible for doing 
pavement repairs on site, we don't want to hold them accountable for damage and we 
certainly don't want to be stranded with costs for repair that are in some way not attributable 
to the work that Metro-North is responsible for.  There have been a couple of walk throughs 
and some photo documentation. There is another walk through tomorrow with Metro-
North personnel to go through these exact issues. 
 
Trustee Arest next noted that neighborhoods that border the Village Center will  
be impacted by this and that there probably is no way around doing this work and not 
having that impact.  He asked if the Village has done everything they can to insure the 
proper notice will be given to those neighborhood associations; do they have any kind of a 
hotline that residents can call with complaints. He stated that he thinks that it is very 
important that we have a system in place before executing this and before moving forward. 
He stated that he would like to hear how the Village is going to make sure we do whatever 
we can to make their lives better. 
 
Deputy Village Manager Cole stated that last week the Village provided advance 
notification to the neighborhood association Presidents that are most proximate to the 
project site being Old Scarsdale Neighborhood Association and Overhill Neighborhood 
Association.  Both neighborhood association presidents have received notice.  The Village 
provided them with phone numbers that Metro-North has given the Village as complaint 
numbers to where they can call Metro-North directly.  In addition to that, the Village has 
negotiated with Metro-North to see if they can get those lights on the site that will be much 
quieter.  Furthermore, the Village has really placed a significant emphasis on the fact that the 
conditions that Metro-North is operating in are not the usual circumstances when they come 
into a community along their line to do infrastructure and that people have had some very 
significant life experiences that have caused a great deal of stress and are continuing to cause 
stress. So someone earlier had mentioned how that might play into noise impacts associated 
with the gas powered blowers and things of that nature.   He stated that this noise is the gas 
powered blowers times 10 in some cases. What the Village has tried to do is work with 
Metro-North to make sure that the most significant noise impacts will happen during the 
day.  That won't always be true, and there will be times when they're going to have to make 
some pretty loud construction noises in the overnight hours.  However, the Village will have 
advance notice of those particular days and times, and they will provide that information by 
email notification to the same neighborhood association presidents in Overhill and Old 
Scarsdale.

Deputy Village Manager Cole noted that just by the very nature of the work, lifting 
rails and rebuilding them is going to be loud at certain points.  Additionally, there's a lot of 
trucks over there and Metro-North has represented that they will be able to keep those 
vehicles within the space the Village has allowed.   However, now it turns out they can't, for 
whatever reason, due to COVID-19 precautions.  They had brought in some extra vehicles 
that the Village didn't anticipate.  He stated that he talked to them today about that, and 
informed that that they can't just do that, they have to let the Village know what is going on.   
He stated that he informed them that the Village was interested in and seeing the project 
move forward because the residents value Metro-North as an asset in the community. It 
helps us economically, as well as for the convenience of our residents, but at the same time, 
we have some very unique circumstances we're working with.  He informed Metro-North 
that they have to be our partner and help us minimize noise, lighting disruptions and 
vehicular parking disruptions, and to the extent that there are some exceptions, we have to 
work around what might happen.  The Village will do that in collaboration with Metro-
North, but also with as much advanced notice as we could possibly provide to the 
neighborhood association.  He noted that this has been thought through quite a bit. 
 
Trustee Arest agreed that he is sure it has he appreciated that.  He stated that Trustee 
Lewis is the liaison to the Old Scarsdale Neighborhood Associate and that he is the liaison to 
the Overhill Neighborhood Association and stated that they can help in terms of 
coordinating; however, it sounded as though Deputy Manager Cole had really thought this 
out and it's very much appreciated. 
 
Deputy Village Manager Cole stated that he would be to copy Trustees Arest and 
Lewis on communications with to the neighborhood association presidents to let them know 
that the exchanges are taking place. 
 
Trustee Lewis thanked Deputy Village Manager Cole for his work and leadership on 
this. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that Deputy Village Manager Cole has been out in 
front of this from day one, the Village knows what is going to happen out there and the 
impact it's going to have on the neighborhoods.  It's very important that the work is done 
and this is the right time to do it while all the trains aren't running as often. Otherwise, the 
amount of time it would take for them to complete this work would be double if they were 
doing it during track closures, which are really just a few hours in the middle of the night. So 
we hope we can get through it and Metro-North clearly understands the Village’s position 
and Deputy Village Manager Cole just explained it.  The Village will do its best to protect the 
residents.

Before voting, Trustee Arest asked if this was just a good faith mistake that it was 
built on the encroachment, to which Village Manager Pappalardo replied affirmatively, that 
we have to take it as a good faith mistake. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that he understands that it is frustrating and that 
he has had some recent conversations with the staff as it relates to what seems to be a 
number of times where some of these contractors working on these projects are towards the 
completion of their two year building permits cycle and end up on Village property.  They 
then come back for a license agreement.  He stated that there are some things that he would 
like to see, such as survey stake the property before they start construction and ensure that 
those survey stakes don't disappear during the course of construction, and take a bit of a 
harder line when we find out at the end of the day that they're on Village property.  He 
stated that there'll be further discussions about that. 
 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
282 
 
Trustee Arest stated that he appreciates and he understands that his team can't be 
everywhere. He stated that this is nothing personal and he doesn’t know this applicant and is 
not even familiar with the property.  However, he stated that it seems to happen and from 
working on the Zoning Board, he was trying to look at it as a precedent and also for 
motivations for people as they continue to do this.  However, he stated that it is hard for 
him when he has relatively limited information.  He stated that he understands that the 
Village Engineer looked at this.  He stated that he just wants his colleagues to know that he 
will be abstaining from this because he is concerned; he doesn’t have enough information in 
order to make an informed decision, and he would welcome holding this resolution over. 
However, if everyone else is supportive of it, then he won’t step in anyone’s way. 
 
Trustee Crandall stated that based on what she just heard from Trustee Arest, she 
was in favor of holding this over so that the Board can obtain more information because she 
agrees that the Village needs its right-of-way, respected, and we certainly need our building 
code respected, so she would be in favor of a holdover to obtain more information. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that he thinks that these encroachments are fairly 
innocuous and that the larger picture is moving forward. He stated that he’d like a standard 
that is more in line with unforeseen field conditions that may arise at a job site which may 
require a few feet of encroachment on Village property to assist the contractor, who would 
otherwise have a major cost on their end or significant delays. As far as the actual 
encroachment itself in this particular case, he thought it was fairly innocuous.  If we're going 
to be working internally to change that standard to be a much higher standard to come to 
the Village Board with a license agreement he would suggest, in this case that the Board 
adopt this one, let this one move on and we will work in the future to make sure that the bar 
is raised on the license agreement standard. 
 
Trustee Ross stated that as he understands it, it has been essentially a matter of 
policy in the Village not to take a punitive approach when the encroachment did not cause 
any safety hazard or other discernible detriment to the Village or the public.  He stated that 
he is not sure that he is entirely in favor of that policy, but he does believe that it is a de 
facto policy and it's established.  If the Village is going to change it, as he thinks they may, he 
felt that some messaging to the public is in order.  So therefore, on a going forward basis, 
the residents and property owners can expect to be treated differently than similarly situated 
property owners were in the past. 
 
Trustee Lewis thanked Trustee Ross first for saying what he was going to probably 
say, and agreed 100% with what he just said, which is that this sounds like a very important 
item. He appreciates Trustees Arest and Crandall flagging this for the Board, but he agreed 
with Trustee Ross that we should not change policy, whether it be by historic precedent or 
otherwise ad hoc, and it feels like not moving forward in this way given the staff 
recommendation, would be an ad hoc reaction to it and from the standpoint of process and 
governance, he thought that the Board should definitely delve more deeply into this. 
Everybody is treated equitably and he noted that it would be wonderful if they could begin 
to schedule and keep track of these items that they are flagging in these meetings for follow 
up.  He agreed with Trustees Arest and Crandall that this is an important issue, but he also 
agreed with Trustee Ross that the Board needs to be fair and equitable based on prior 
history and address this in a policy formulation framework.

283 
 
 
Trustee Veron stated that she has watched how these matters come before the Board 
and they do talk about perhaps modifying policy, but she stated that she agrees with Trustee 
Ross in that she didn’t want be unduly punitive to an individual homeowner without 
studying the issue first.  She stated that it doesn’t seem out of character with other things 
that the Board has permitted. She stated that she would rather address it going forward, and 
agreed with Trustee Lewis in that she would like to make sure that the Board captures these 
agenda items and schedule them so that the Board can talk through some of the policy 
issues. 
 
Trustee Crandall asked Village Manager Pappalardo if he were suggesting that staff 
would handle this sort of thing without this coming to the Village Board because she would 
not be in favor of that approach. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that staff does not need the Village Board to 
guide them.  If contractors stay on their property and they build in accordance with the 
approved plans, then you know there's no Village Board action.  He stated that he is trying 
to make sure that these license agreements don't become pro forma for those contractors 
who might have an easier time by using a few feet of Village property as opposed to building 
on the private property and there's a lot more to it, obviously, to that and there's always 
particulars for every situation.  He stated that this is really more about moving forward, 
making sure that unless there is a construction impediment that really was unknown at the 
time that the plans were approved or that there were unknown field condition of some sort, 
where they would come to the Village Board and say, here are the alternatives, we think a 
few feet on an encroachment would make sense in this case, it's fitting, and it t works as 
opposed to having them do something a lot more elaborate and more time consuming. It’s a 
reasonableness issue.   
 
Trustee Crandall stated that her recollection of the Code is that if you know ahead of 
time that you want to do something in the right of way that there's a process where you 
come to the Building department and you ask for permission to do whatever it is in the 
Village right of way.  They have seen that before with walkway extensions and that type of 
thing.  However, it seems like here they say that this is already built. She stated that the Code 
really needs to be respected and, she’ll vote in favor this time, just so that she’s not being 
punitive. She asked Village Manager Pappalardo to convey a message to staff that we need 
our building code to be followed – it’s there for a reason. 
 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that this is already in the works. 
 
Trustee Arest stated that he remained conflicted.  He stated that he respected all the 
comments of his colleagues and he always give deference to Village staff.  In this case, he 
stated that he would like to believe that he has been consistent with his position that if this 
was private land, the outcome would not be similar to what we're doing here. And it doesn't 
mean its wrong and it doesn't mean we wouldn't do this and if they did come to the Board 
before the building was done, he just would like a little bit more information.  However, he 
stated that he respects everyone wanting to proceed and for those reasons, and what he 
stated before, he will abstain.

Trustee Crandall stated that given that this is such a difficult time for everyone, her 
inclination is to be agreeable she will vote in favor.

Public Comment: 
 
 
Mayor Samwick opened the second public comment portion of the meeting to 
anyone wishing to make comments. 
 
 
Robert Berg, 32 Tisdale Road, stated that he forgot to mention in his earlier 
comments this evening about installment payments for School and Village taxes that in the 
Board’s work session this evening they discussed the memorandum that the village Treasurer 
prepared with the assistance of Trustee Arest.  He stated that he would like a copy of this 
memorandum appended to the minutes of tonight's meeting, if possible, and in the interim, 
he would like to be provided with a copy of this memorandum 
 
Secondly, Mr. Berg stated that he sent the Mayor a petition signed by 147 residents 
requesting that the Village Board adopt the resolution authorizing the two installment billing 
plan for the School tax.  He stated that he was sure those residents will be happy to learn 
that the Village Board is moving forward on that resolution and is also doing the same so 
with respect to Village taxes. 
 
Next, Mr. Berg stated that he was disheartened to receive by email containing a press 
release from the Village Clerk this afternoon announcing that all parking permits issued by 
the Village have been extended until September 30, 2020.  He stated that this extension 
includes all parking permits for Christie Place, Freightway commuter parking, and the open 
lots.  This also includes the Scarsdale Avenue morning parking permits.  He is concerned 
that this decision will have very substantial ramifications for the Village.  There's been no 
advanced public discussion of this during the recent budget discussion for the Fiscal Year 
2020-2021 Village Budget.  He stated that parking and traffic fines are among Village sources 
of revenue, and the Village’s permit parking lots provide the Village with significant annual 
revenue.  In the budget that was just adopted for 2020-2021, the Village projected  
 
Robert: In the just adopted village budget for 2020 2021 the village has projected $1,369,150 
in revenues from Village permit parking plus $195,900 in revenues from the valet parking

operations.  Now, without any public discussion of the issue and without a meeting of the 
Board of Trustees, and without any prior notice to the public, the Village has decided to give 
some residents and non-residents, about 1,000 in total who are current parking permit 
holders a big break.  The current parking passes normally expire on June 30, 2020 but now 
they’ll get a free three month’s extension.  He stated that this is very nice for these residence 
and nonresidents, but its going cost Scarsdale residents about $350,000 in foregone revenue 
for this gift to current parking permit holders.  He stated that this is going to cost every 
property owner increased Village taxes next year to make up for this gift.  He conceded that 
there are certainly arguments that can be made that the current permit holders weren't able 
to get full value of their permits because no one's been commuting to the city since the 
middle of March, but this argument ignores the fact that many of the permit holders have 
been using the permit since July 1, 2019.  Additionally, the Village has never closed its 
parking facilities, and permit holders have been able to use those facilities during the 
pandemic, including Village merchants.  He stated that there are certainly valid arguments 
against giving an expensive freebie to some Scarsdale residents and nonresidents when the 
Village desperately needs the revenue.  He stated that his biggest issue here is the process by 
which the decision was made, who made the decision to grant the three months, a three 
month’s permit extension.  He asked what data analysis was conducted to assess the 
economic impact of this decision.  He stated that this decision was announced this afternoon 
with the press release, and asked why this issue wasn’t on the Board’s agenda for tonight's 
meeting so that it could be discussed at an open public meeting of the Board with public 
comment. 
 
Mr. Berg stated that the public is entitled to answers to these questions. This should 
not be a matter left to the discretion of the Village Manager.: A $350,000 hit to Village 
revenues in these desperate times is too large to be made by the Village Manager on his own, 
without approval by the Board of Trustees after public debate.  
 
 
Michael Levine, Walworth Avenue, stated that he would be happy to put off half of 
my School taxes in September however, he stated that we should look at this in a certain 
perspective.  He stated that this is a onetime four-month delay for half of my taxes, or it 
averages out to a onetime two month delay in all my taxes and in return for this onetime two 
month delay, he is going to be a taxpayer who is subject to a budget which is increasing 
because of a permanent increase in the collection costs and the other costs associated with 
doing this.  He stated that it is not that much a matter of concern, but it's just kind of like a 
reaction to a serious crisis, but it's just not that big of a deal. Also, he stated that he didn’t 
think in the long term this would really help people who are having chronic financial 
troubles.  If somebody's having trouble paying X dollars a year, it doesn't really matter if it's 
three installments, or five installments or 12 installments or weekly installments.  He stated 
that this is the underlying problem. 
 
Mr. Levine continued, stated that he believed that the late fees will be the same, as 
the same people will be late.  Whatever the scheduling is, people will continue to be late in 
their payments.  He stated that he was not really going to object to it, but that it should be 
put into perspective.   
 
Robert Harrison, 65 Fox Meadow Road, stated that Mr. Levine is entitled to his 
opinion.  As a 40 year resident of this community, and as Chairman of the Scarsdale 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
293 
 
Taxpayer Alert since 1989, he stated that he always tries to get good value for our tax dollars 
and he vehemently disagreed with Mr. Levine's comments.  He stated that he pays his taxes 
mostly out of his 401K.   He stated that when you take money out of your 401K, you have 
to pay taxes on it and it's nice to be able to take half of the amount out in September and the 
other half the following year and not pay taxes on it until April 15th of 2022.  He stated that 
this is a definite benefit to Scarsdale residents, particularly the older residents.  Also, this will 
benefit the younger families who have lots of kids and have tremendous pressure, and maybe 
have lost their jobs, or had pay cuts.  He urged the Board to adopt this t as soon as possible.  
He recommended that the Board call a special meeting next week and vote on this or put it 
on their agenda for the Board’s June 9th meeting, which is the day of the School Board vote, 
but not until 7:00 or 8:00 pm as the School Board votes have to be in by 5:00 pm on that 
that Tuesday, June 9th.  Everyone will get a ballot in the mail in the next few days. 
 
Mr. Harrison stated it appears that the Board is thinking about providing for two 
payments for Village taxes, and asked if the Board could clarify that.  The bill for those taxes 
are mailed on July 1st, so there is not much time.   
 
Mr. Harrison asked the Mayor to repeat the PO Box number to where we can send 
contributions to SVAC.  He stated that it would be helpful for getting more donations to 
SVAC. 
 
Mr. Harrison stated that the Village’s Recreation Department did a nice thing in 
selling senior tennis permits for $47 which is a bargain, he and his wife got two permits for 
$84 instead of $70 apiece.   
 
In regard to sales tax revenue, Mr. Harrison asked whether or not people who buy 
through Amazon pay sales tax to Scarsdale.  He also asked about the situation with the fees 
and charges for late payment of County taxes and how that was finally decided upon. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that he would answer a couple of questions posed by Mr. 
Harrison. First, the Scarsdale Volunteer Ambulance Corps address is PO Box 92.a volunteer 
ambulance Corps P. O. Box 92, Scarsdale, New York.  Also, he stated that Amazon is now 
paying sales tax in New York, so Scarsdale does get a piece of that.  Regarding the County 
taxes, he stated that the County tax late payments are actually a little complicated.  He asked 
Deputy Village Manager Cole to give a description of that since he is an expert on those 
alternatives. 
 
Deputy Manager Cole responded that he is not prepared to speak to that this 
evening. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that Village Treasurer McClure is not here this evening to 
explain this; however, to answer Mr. Harrison’s question, he stated that there are two 
options available.  He stated that he didn’t want to put anyone else under the spot to go into 
any detail.   
 
Trustee Arest stated that in regard to the late penalty options for the County taxes, 
he didn’t have the exact numbers, but there is one option, which reduces the penalty burden. 
Village Board of Trustees Meeting 05/26/2020 
 
                         
294 
 
And then the second option is that there is an individual taxpayer certification with certain 
criteria, and if you meet those criteria you are relieved of all penalties through July 15 2020.  
He stated that he would be happy to send that information to Mr. Harrison and anybody 
else that needs it. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that there was a press release issued by the Village when that 
was implemented on the Village’s website at www.scarsdale.com.  
 
 
There being no further comments, Mayor Samwick closed the second public 
comment portion of the meeting.

THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-SECOND 
 
SPECIAL MEETING 
 
Video Conference 
Via Zoom 
May 29, 2020 
 
A Special Meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Village of Scarsdale was held on 
Friday, May 29, 2020 via video conference (Zoom) at 5:08 p.m. 
 
Present were Mayor Samwick and Trustees Arest, Crandall, Lewis, Ross, Veron, and 
Waldman.   Also present were Village Manager Stephen Pappalardo, Deputy Village Manager 
Cole, Assistant Village Manager Richards, Village Attorney Pozin, Deputy Village Attorney 
Garrison, Village Clerk Conkling, and Assistant to the Village Manager Katzin. 
 
* * * * * * * * 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that the Board is working very hard with the with the Village 
merchants which includes the Village Center, as well as the Heathcote Five Corners and a 
portion of the Golden Horseshoe to help them reopen.  The schedule that we have, which 
could be subject to change, is that Phase Two of New York Forward would commence on 
June 9, 2020, which is the date of the next regular Village Board meeting, so the Board is 
having a special meeting this evening to schedule a public hearing for that date.  The public 
hearing requires 10 days’ notice, and thanked the Village Clerk for having the notice 
published in the Journal News in a timely manner.   
 
Mayor Samwick stated that the Board does not like to do items such as this on such 
short notice, and doesn’t like to act on the night when the public hearing is initially held; the 
Board may decide not to act on June 9th, but it wants to at least schedule it to coincide with 
Phase Two, which is the opening of retail establishments on the June 9th, again, if in fact 
that is what the Board wants to do. 
 
The Board has received the proposed local law change, which is fairly 
straightforward.   The Village has restrictions on sidewalk blockage in the current Village 
Code.   What the Board is contemplating here is a short term of 4 1/2, almost 5 months, of 
a suspension of that and the formation of a committee. That committee would include the 
Village Engineer Goessl, who is here.   Assistant Village Manager Ingrid Richards will serve 
as the designee of the Village Managers Office.  Trustee Veron has been integrally involved 
in all things surrounding the Village Center for very long time. In fact, probably predating 
her years on the Board.  And as Trustee Veron is going to likely be leaving the Board in 
September, Trustee Arest is likely to fill in that position as the point person for Village 
Center.  
 
Mayor Samwick stated that they have already started having discussions with the 
Scarsdale Business Alliance (SBA) and local merchants about what they can do and what we 
Village Board of Trustees Special Meeting 05/29/2020 
 
                         
296 
 
as a Village can do to help with the reopening because this is a real challenge and it's also a 
real opportunity.   So, um, that's sort of the backdrop if people have questions about it. 
He stated that he would like to take questions from the Board, if any and then the Board can 
move to schedule the public hearing.  
 
Trustee Crandall stated that this was a great idea and thanked everyone involved for 
getting things in motion here.  She suggested that they add the new Village Planner to the 
committee, because their expertise enables them to analyze things like traffic flow, pedestrian 
connections, and the new planner seems to have a great ideas.  He seems quite motivated 
and she stated that she didn’t see any downside and adding one more to the committee; it 
could be a fabulous mix of great minds. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that having worked with Greg Cutler, what we 
what we've seen from him and based on his background and certainly working with 
merchants in this area he has a knack for spatial layout and organization. Mr. Cutler would 
also be helpful in terms of traffic flow, etc.  It might be a good way for him also to get 
acclimated.  He'll meet people, he'll meet the SBA, he’ll work with a couple of the Trustees 
and some new members of the staff right out of the gate. He stated that he was fine with 
adding him to the committee. 
 
Trustee Veron concurred. She stated that place making is something that planners 
think a lot about.  He would also have knowledge of having spaces that are pedestrian 
friendly, bike friendly, be familiar with ADA compliance and all those kinds of things.  She 
stated that she would love to have him join Ingrid on the Committee.  She noted that 
Assistant Village Manager Richards has been like a partner in this and she somehow 
miraculously got a site visit scheduled on Monday with Village Engineer David Goessl and 
that she was very excited that they are going to do that. She stated that they are meeting at 
9:30 in front of Rothmans to start the walk through and just get a lay of the land. She stated 
that she endorsed that idea. 
 
Trustee Veron continued, stating that they will probably need to lean also on 
communication resources to make sure they are clear with the public; it will be new and 
different.  She stated that she has a question and that she has already heard from the SBA 
from some of the service businesses, and, in particular, she’s gotten questions from gyms, or 
a yoga business. She had a question from a yoga studio as they want to understand how 
opening up fits for them. To what extent do we consider certain services? She stated that she 
just wanted the Board to explore it as they think about this legislation. 
 
Trustee Lewis stated that first he wanted to congratulate Trustee Crandall for her 
great suggestion, he seconded it.  He stated that he thinks it's a wonderful idea in a great way 
to integrate the new Village planner, and it sounds like everyone's appreciative and thinks 
that's it’s a wonderful idea. With regards to process, he stated that this is very important, and 
he felt that it will also be important to integrate the views of our community at some 
appropriate time as the ideas are developed, it'd be wonderful to have a working session on 
this because he thought that they all see this as an important challenge to our region and into 
the Village. If we can come out of this with ideas that are particularly innovative, it might be 
possible for them to emerge from this stronger, and perhaps grab market share from other 
Village centers who aren't as innovative to create a socially distant, fun friendly environment 
Village Board of Trustees Special Meeting 05/29/2020 
 
                         
297 
 
in a time that's challenged for fun and friendliness. He thanked those who are going to serve 
on the committee and look forwarded to supporting the Committee, and hoped that the 
Board could engage the public in a working session on this as early as possible to get their 
views - the people who we want to go to the Village center to spend money and to engage 
and to have a good time. 
 
Trustee Lewis stated that his final point is that June 9th will be a heavy day and the 
Board has a working session that day as well.  He stated that he hoped the Board will be able 
to maintain enough time on that evening to have a very, very thorough conversation.  In 
regard to the budget and their first working session, he stated that a number of us have 
meaningful questions about scenarios and reserve levels, and how our financial projections 
are unfolding.  He stated that he wanted to make sure that the Board doesn’t in any way 
shorten that important conversation. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that he agreed, and further stated that one of the things that 
they hope can come out of this is an opportunity that they may be trying some different 
things in the Village center and that can create some opportunities for them to do things 
differently than they’ve done or certainly explore things that are different than what they’ve 
done before and do that with the clear goal and objective of bringing as much vibrancy and 
vitality to the Village center as possible.  He pointed out that this goes beyond just the 
Village center. 
 
Trustee Arest stated that he agreed with Trustee Lewis’s point.  The way that he 
understood this and was looking at this, in terms of short term, medium term, long term, 
etc., there is an impediment here and they need to bring back the Village center and other 
retail hubs, and for all of the merchants, bringing them back stronger if possible, and finding 
the opportunities and taking advantage of them. This impediment is very time sensitive if we 
do go into Phase two on June 9th.  He stated that he really appreciates that this meeting was 
called as quickly as it was, and that they were able to do this, and hopefully move forward on 
June 9th.  In terms of medium term and long term he thought that they will learn so much 
from this.  He stated that he supports further work sessions with further studies into this so 
that they can try to take what they learn and do something great. And find the opportunities, 
the silver lining, where they can better the community. 
 
Trustee Veron stated that they have spoken to everyone; Golden Horseshoe 
Shopping Center, Five Corners, Garth Road, and the Village center –and each of them is 
really different. And each of them has different desires, different constraints, and different 
ownership.  So they have decided that they had to address them each independently but 
provide for each of them holistically.  The point is that there's things that are specific to each 
area. She stated that they ensure that the SBA permits and requires everyone to participate. 
The dues are free, so there is no impediment to joining; they're going to help us in terms of 
communication and coordination and so forth. When they spoke they talked about the 
immediate hurdle, what is the constraining factor, which was the constraint around the 
Code. However, then we have discussions around medium term and long term and that is 
going to be robust and creative and she stated that she would love a public discussion on the 
calendar, because we want to know what people want and what they want to keep changing 
with people's experiences. She stated that she had a talk with somebody in Colorado, it just 
keeps unfolding so rapidly. 
Village Board of Trustees Special Meeting 05/29/2020 
 
                         
298 
 
 
Trustee Lewis stated that they can zoom from anywhere and be socially distant and 
do that working session from the Village center, socially distant from each other and it might 
be a nice way to make a point and be outdoors. 
 
Trustee Crandall stated that they should let the committee have its first meeting and 
then see what kind of agenda they would like to see on some of this. And then the Board 
can do the calendar.  
 
Trustee Ross stated that he agreed wholeheartedly with everything they have been 
talking about starting from the need for this amendment itself and including Trustee 
Crandall’s excellent suggestion.  He stated that he thought that it's important that the Board 
have at least the opportunity to vote on June 9th; they may or may not do so but he thought 
it was important to do it as he was not really sure that a great deal of discussion is required 
before they adopt the amendment to the Code.  He added that they do have the committee 
that's going to be flushing things out.  He stated that having the opportunity to act quickly is 
very important. He stated that he thought that there's a very realistic chance that it will be 
really important to do it and they should have that opportunity. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that one of the things that they really thought about in terms 
of putting together this proposed amendment to the local law was what gets included and 
what doesn't.  And the thought really was that the ground level space is really the defining 
criteria and that those that are upstairs or downstairs would be viewed somewhat differently. 
This is designed for those who have a more retail like presence with their interaction with 
their customers.  People walking along the streets is very different than people on different 
floors and what the concern that that if you take a dentist or an attorney or whatever it may 
be, that may be on a second floor space somewhere, or third floor space somewhere, it may 
not be appropriate to attempt to create space for them as well.  There is limited space.  It 
depends on what is done, but the Board is really trying to help the more retail-like merchants 
here.  
 
Trustee Veron stated that the yoga PT people who have reached out and she asked if 
they could envision the use of Chase Park for something that would fit and if that would be 
a Village decision that could be permitted.  
 
Mayor Samwick stated that this is another part of the discussion when it comes to 
the streets or Chase Park.  That is a Village decision that's outside of the purview of this 
Board to begin with.  The Board doesn’t need to make any code changes at all or waive any 
provisions of code or amended provisions of code to do something like that.  Doing a 
Saturday morning yoga class in the park as a weekly event is something we could do 
independently of the Code... 
 
Trustee Arest asked if a gym at ground level falls under that definition because he 
thought that the Zoning code in that regard is fairly broad. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that if the gym sells apparel or some other related 
types of items other than utilizing it as a gym and most of them do that, you probably could 
stretch that definition to say they are selling wares from their store.  He stated that this 
Village Board of Trustees Special Meeting 05/29/2020 
 
                         
299 
 
amendment will allow the merchants to place their goods on the sidewalk, which it prohibits 
right now, so that opens up the entirety of the Village right-of-way for them to display their 
wares. 
 
Village Attorney Pozin stated that the way we're also looking at this is where we're 
saying that the premises is operated as a retail store, food service establishment, sidewalk 
café or is a nonresidential use occupying any ground floor, street facing space. So if you had 
a gym on street level with a storefront but it's a gym, they may be able to have T-shirts or 
whatever kind of things out that people could buy so there was some contemplation of that. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that he also wanted to be cognizant of the fact that selling 
wares or food or doing whatever it may be on the street is one thing.  If it is in a third floor 
space, giving them space on the street level is something we don't want to encourage. 
 
Trustee Lewis stated that he thought that Chase Park or Boniface Circle may have 
ample space, such that if a process was put in place and publicly announced.  With the type 
of weather that we now have it might be possible that someone on the upper floors, perhaps 
an attorney might want to rent a 10 by 10 space in Chase Park and put up a tent to conduct 
his legal practice outdoors, but somebody in some other service such as a dentist might not 
be able to.  He stated that he thought that the Board should be able to have a process that 
they offer that's fair and open and equitable to even the establishments that are above 
ground to give them an outdoors venue and that might be one of the ways that we might 
reinvent how business is conducted.  He stated that people might enjoy meeting their 
lawyers outdoors.  
 
Mayor Samwick stated that at this time the Board should not lose sight of the 
mission here. The mission is not necessarily about office space. The Board has to be careful 
of what they are doing here. And he felt that a focused approach to help the street front 
merchants and businesses survive this transition is the goal. Everything else is really well 
intentioned and the Board certainly can have discussions about it or whatever else. But the 
goal here is to have these people who are front-facing succeed and succeed this transition. 
 
Trustee Crandall stated that from what she is hearing from her fellow Trustees is that 
the sentiment is to have a more expansive goal, where they are looking to support whoever 
does business in the different retail centers. She stated that they have an opportunity here to 
make this new code provision more flexible, and the safeguard would be to give the 
committee more power and to have them in charge of coordinating some of these 
competing interests.  So many people are going to want their chance to succeed, and to make 
back some of the money they've lost.  She stated that they shouldn’t limit it to the businesses 
on street level, just because that may give the appearance of success.  She stated that she 
would be in favor of making this a bit more flexible so that the committee could exercise its 
discretion and help the businesses however they can.  She noted another park in the Village 
that could be used. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that those are not contemplated here to begin with.  
 
Trustee Lewis stated that Trustee Crandall is pointing out that what's been presented 
to the Board is too narrow and he agrees that the Board should give the committee greater 
Village Board of Trustees Special Meeting 05/29/2020 
 
                         
300 
 
flexibility to envision this.  He stated that he would like to empower the committee with 
being able to have the flexibility to achieve a bolder economic vision for all economic 
stakeholders, not just those who, by accident, the located on the first floor. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that the Board has to recognize and be careful of the 
consequences they may create here; unintended consequences if you have a street front 
presence. They are paying a premium to do that and the way you interact with the public is 
different.  If you have a second or third floor or basement space or whatever it may be, your 
interaction is fundamentally different. He stated that he is not suggesting that those other 
businesses are not important to them, they are. But what this is designed to do is deal with 
the impediment as Trustee Arest said before, which is the limitation on uses of the sidewalk. 
He stated that if the Board is building a competition among third floor businesses versus 
street front businesses, that's not the intent here and they have to be careful about how they 
do that. 
 
Trustee Lewis stated that they don't want people to fight over sidewalk space, but all 
Trustee Crandall was saying and he was offering as well is that we have other ways we can 
accommodate others, and we should empower the committee to think through how our 
other public spaces could be an engine of economic transformation for all the businesses 
who are stakeholders in a local economy. 
 
Trustee Arest stated that as someone who's being proposed to be on this committee. 
He was not sure if he was comfortable with that much power. At this point, he stated that he 
feels very strongly that as they start to think bigger, he would really like to hear from all of 
his colleagues on thoughts on these things that could really have fundamental changes to the 
Village center and other places.  He stated that he feels more comfortable having a narrower 
plan of action for something that's proactive and it's time sensitive.  
 
Trustee Arest stated that he and Trustee Veron will report back as often as possible 
and that he will support them in any way he can to find out what the next step is, and he will 
support any additional powers, either to that committee or to another committee to make all 
of these things happen. 
 
Village Attorney Pozin stated that the Board chose this particular Avenue, because it 
is modifying the provisions of the Code that doesn’t allow certain activities on sidewalks and 
really that's all we're doing - we're allowing those uses to spread out to the sidewalks as the 
businesses start to reopen so that perhaps they still have social distancing inside so if they're 
able to put some wares out on the sidewalk and have a display, people can shop out there. 
He stated that it is a larger discussion that would have to be taken on by the whole Board in 
terms of dealing overall with all the areas in the Village. This is just a little more focused to 
get it going.  It is also temporary and the Board may come up with scenarios where it would 
make sense to have something more permanent in place for an overall promotion of retail, 
plus service and restaurants, etc. So we don't want to go too far in zoning, but we want to 
give an opportunity for people to be outside to get their merchandise out to and be apparent 
to shoppers and people seeking restaurants, etc.  This is not intended to slight any businesses 
or anybody.

Trustee Arest added that in addition to wanting to come back for full Board 
discussion, but to include the public in meetings like this, rather than in the committee 
structure.  He stated that he was sure that there are people in the community who will give 
us their thoughts and be very helpful. 
 
Trustee Ross stated that he thought these were all great ideas, but he would hate to 
see the addition of other ideas that are good, delay or sidetracked the discussion of the 
proposed amendment the Board has now. He thought that this is a priority and that other 
ideas, as good and as valuable as they are can wait for the Board to do this first. 
 
Trustee Veron asked about the sidewalks at Heathcote Five Corners and the parking 
lot at the Golden Horseshoe and whether or not the Village owns any part of those. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that he thought that the sidewalks that are there are on 
private property that is owned by the owner of the shopping facility. 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo informed Trustee Veron that this is all private property, 
the Golden Horseshoe is located just within the Village but the Village does not have a 
parking lot or any of the walkways there. 
 
Mayor Samwick stated that the Village does own part of the sidewalk coming over 
the bridge; but that's way outside that I and it's narrow it doesn't have parking or pedestrian 
friendly attributes. 
 
Trustee Veron stated that she has put together a list of land owners and property 
owners and have communicated with as many as they could. She stated that the landowner 
of the Golden horseshoe is really excited about these ideas. She asked if there was any land 
Palmer Road that belongs to the Village.   
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that the Heathcote Fiver Corners is a little 
difficult. It is a New York State Department of Transportation intersection controlled by 
them; the Village does own the sidewalks as you drive from west to east. If you're coming 
from the Village, as you enter the five corners and you continue up Heathcote Road, that 
small sidewalk there, with the wine shop on the corner with the barbershop belongs to the 
Village but the main sidewalk on Palmer where the bank is and the Metro Diner is owned by 
the State; the sidewalk is actually partially owned by the NYSDOT and partially owned by 
Scarsdale Improvement. The Village does not have control of those sidewalk, and if we 
wanted to use those sidewalks we'd have to get a permit from the New York State 
Department of Transportation, supply them with indemnification, etc.  
 
Village Attorney Pozin suggested that perhaps as part of the committee's review is 
that is that someone prepare a map or something that could highlight or indicate which areas 
are within the Village’s purview, which are private, and which are owned by the State, and  
have that available to the committee.  
 
Trustee Arest posed the question as to whether business could utilize parking spots  
on the street or parking spaces in the parking lot.

302 
 
Village Manager Pappalardo stated that the road bed where the parking spaces are on 
Palmer Road belong to the NYSDOT.  The Village has no meters out there.   
 
Trustee Waldman stated that it seems that what they are doing here this evening is 
similar as to what is done for the sidewalk sale.   
 
Trustee Veron stated that it is somewhat, but when the sidewalk sale is held they also 
have tents in front of the stores and it is only held for a few days. This is more of an ongoing 
permission to utilize the sidewalk area.  
 
Upon motion entered by Trustee Veron, and seconded by Trustee Ross, the 
following resolution Calling for a Public Hearing on a Local Law Amending Chapter 256 of

Re: 
SEQRA Compliance: Proposed Local Law for Temporary Outdoor Retail and Food Sales 
 
In response to the impacts of the pandemic on the Village of Scarsdale retail environment, the 
proposed local law will temporarily permit retail and food service establishments to display and/or sell 
on or directly above any sidewalk or other public space its goods, wares or merchandise, food and 
beverages provided the establishment obtains a revocable permit from the Village Engineer. The 
proposed local law is intended to give local businesses the option to conduct commerce outdoors, 
where greater social distancing is possible, and uninhibited air circulation may reduce viral 
transmission rates.   
 
In addition, the proposed local law will create a new committee comprised of two members of the 
Village Board of Trustees, the Village Manager or his designee, the Village Planner, and the Village 
Engineer. The committee is tasked with establishing reasonable rules and conditions for the issuance 
of the permits.  
 
As described above, the proposed local law is considered a Type II Action, pursuant to SEQRA, 
NYCRR Part 617.5(c) (21 and 26) as the adoption of the local law constitutes routine or continuing 
agency administration and management, and is temporary in nature.  
 
    
As a Type II Action, no further review is required pursuant to NYCRR Part 617, SEQRA.  
 
Please let me know if you need additional information.

2 
 
as designated by the Mayor, the Village Manager or his/her designee, the Village Planner

Date: 6/3/2020 
Re: 
School and Village Tax Collection Installments 
As you know, the Scarsdale School and Village Boards have publically discussed modifying 
the existing annual School District (District) tax billing and collection process, by providing 
for a second collection period for 50% of the School tax bill. The purpose of adding the 
second collection period is to reduce the financial burden on Village tax payers during the 
COVID-19 crisis when the income of certain resident property owners may have been 
adversely effected.  In consideration of this proposed operational change I offer the following.   
Over the past few decades, the District has been approached more than once and has 
considered collecting school taxes in two installments but has declined each time for 
budgetary purposes. The Village guarantees 100% of the tax levy to the District who in turn 
invests the proceeds, relative to cash flow needs, and budgets the interest income from these 
investments. While investment rates are currently at or near historic lows, depending on the 
interest rate environment, interest income has been a significant source of revenue for the 
District. The current 2019-2020 District levy is roughly $140 million. Assuming that the 
Town of Scarsdale collects 94% of the levy in the first month, and assuming that the second 
half school tax was collected in January, the District would lose roughly $438,000 over a four 
month period if interest rates were at 2%. 
The fiscal impact on the Village is related to penalties on late payments, which for FY18-19 
totaled $198,235.  A total of $500,000 is budgeted in the current year FY19-20 budget and 
$525,000 in the FY20-21 budget.  Penalty income is derived from delinquent Village, County 
and School tax payments as well as penalties on liens. Although this impact is less both in 
dollars and percentage of the overall budgetary revenues as compared to the District, it is still 
an important part of the Village revenue. Revenue from penalties would drop both for the first 
installment and the second installment.  
Operationally for the Village Treasurer’s Office the staff would add another collection to the 
annual schedule. The Village staff is already in collection for the following months: June, July, 
August, September, November, January, February, April and May. Water bills are prepared in 
Village of Scarsdale 
 Page 2 
July, October, January and April and tax bills are prepared in March, June and August.  
Adding another tax collection will require moving to a lockbox operation or hiring additional 
part-time or seasonal staff.   
There are also tax collection software issues with a second collection. I have spoken to our 
representative at Software Consulting Associates about the proposal to collect school taxes in 
two installments. The conversion for the District collection can be achieved without additional 
cost for the software. We are waiting for an estimate on the redesign of the tax bill. If 
approved, the two installments would be collected in September and in January. 
Presuming we convert to two school tax installments, I would recommend that we convert all 
tax collections to the use of a lockbox. This would add cost to the process but would make the 
work manageable without adding another staff position. Based on current lockbox rates, I 
would estimate that we would pay between $2,200 and $3,000 for each lockbox collection. 
We would continue to offer online payments and accept over-the-counter collections once 
Village Hall reopens to the public again.  Please know that we process between 450 and 800 
payments over-the-counter in the last few days of a tax collection. Mail receipts are 
approximately the same in the last few collection days. 
A customer service impact is that conversion to a lockbox would very likely eliminate our 
ability to review mailed checks for errors near the end of the month. Currently we review 
payments and contact homeowners if there is time to make adjustments to try to avoid 
penalties for our taxpayers. Checks mailed directly to a lockbox may not be received at 
Village Hall in time to reach out to our taxpayers to make corrections. 
Finally, we are also looking into the possible collection of Village taxes in two installments. 
This change would impact Village cash flow, interest income and penalty revenue.  
Village tax bills are mailed at the end of June for collection from July 1 through August 1 
without penalty. At this point, December is the only month available for an additional 
collection. I have spoken with our software representative about the possibility of splitting the 
collection and whether or not there is sufficient time to make the software changes. The 
majority of our software provider’s customers bill taxes in June, limiting the provider’s 
availability to make the necessary software and bill format changes for a July 1 billing. That 
being the case, I heard back from the vendor this week and they are able to make the necessary 
software changes in time for the July 2020 tax billing.  
RESOLUTION RE:   
APPROVAL OF AGREEMENT AMENDING 
DRAINAGE EASEMENT 
 
WHEREAS, 
in or about April 2015, the Village issued permits for the demolition and 
reconstruction of a single family home located at 4 Bethel Road, 
Scarsdale, which property is shown on the Village’s tax map as Section 
14, Block 5, Lot 21 (the “Premises”); and 
 
WHEREAS, 
the approved plans and pre-construction survey upon which said permits 
were granted identified an existing 10 foot wide storm drainage easement 
extending along the left yard setback of the Premises which conveys road 
runoff water between Bethel Road and an open water course to the rear of 
the Premises (the “Easement”); and 
 
WHEREAS,  
the said permits indicated that the drainage system was to be protected and 
preserved and that no development was to take place within the areas of 
the Easement; and 
 
WHEREAS, 
the work to be performed pursuant to the said permits commenced during 
the summer of 2015, with completion in or about August 2016; and 
 
WHEREAS, 
upon completion of such work, an inspection was performed which 
confirmed that the reconstructed dwelling was in conformance with the 
approved plans, but disclosed that certain improvements were installed 
within or encroaching upon the area of the Easement including an asphalt 
concrete driveway extension, cobblestone curbing, large ornamental 
boulders, permanently mounted basketball hoop, heavy stone retaining 
wall, and soil fill of approximate depth ranging between two and four feet, 
(the “Encroachments”); and 
 
WHEREAS, 
none of such Encroachments were approved in advance nor permitted by 
the Village within the area of the Easement; and  
 
WHEREAS, 
a temporary certificate of occupancy was issued for the dwelling with the 
provision that a final certificate of occupancy (“Final CO”) could be 
granted only upon the owners of the Premises rectifying the issue of the 
Encroachments; and  
 
WHEREAS, 
the owners of the Premises have requested that the Village agree to accept 
the Encroachments and permit them to remain; and 
 
WHEREAS, 
the owners of the Premises have agreed to enter into an agreement to 
amend and/or modify the Easement relative to the Encroachments; and  
 
WHEREAS, 
the owners have offered and agreed to perform certain additional work at 
the Premises as a condition precedent to the issuance of the Final CO, such 
additional work to be performed to the satisfaction of the Village 
Engineer, and to include the following: 
 
1.  Perform a video inspection/assessment of the storm drain; and 
2.  Install a cured in-place pipe liner to protect the pipe 
 
collectively, the “Work”; and 
 
WHEREAS, 
after due consideration of all of the above, the Board of Trustees is willing 
to enter into an agreement amending and/or modifying the Easement; now, 
therefore, be it 
 
RESOLVED,  
in light of the unique circumstances of this matter involving the 
demolition of an existing home and the reconstruction of same which lead 
to the installation of the Encroachments, the Village Board of Trustees 
hereby authorizes the Village Manager to execute the Agreement 
Amending Drainage Easement in substantially the form annexed hereto 
which shall be recorded against the Premises, subject to the performance 
of the Work by or on behalf of  the owners of the Premises to the 
satisfaction of the Village Engineer.

AGREEMENT AMENDING DRAINAGE EASEMENT  
THIS AGREEMENT dated as of the ____day of May, 2020, is made by and between 
JOSHUA LAMBERG AND CARA LAMBERG, residing at 7 Bethel Road, Scarsdale, New York 
10583, (hereinafter collectively referred to as “GRANTOR” and the VILLAGE OF SCARSDALE, 
a municipal corporation, having its principal office and place of business at Village Hall, 1001 
Post Road, Scarsdale, New York, 10583, hereinafter, "GRANTEE" (the GRANTOR and 
GRANTEE are sometimes referred to collectively herein as the “Parties”). 
WHEREAS, the GRANTOR is the fee owner of certain real property located at 4 Bethel 
Road, Scarsdale, New York, which is shown on the tax map of the Village of Scarsdale as Section 
14, Block 5, Lot 21, and which is more particularly described on Schedule A annexed hereto and 
made a part hereof (the “Premises”); and 
WHEREAS, by that certain conveyance dated September 16, 1976, and recorded on 
March 24, 1977, in the Office of the Westchester County Clerk as Liber 7383, Pages 289 through 
292 (the “1976 Easement”), GRANTOR’S predecessor in interest granted the Village a permanent 
easement for the purpose of constructing and forever  maintaining public storm drains within that 
portion of the Premises described in said conveyance, which portion of the Premises is more 
particularly described in Schedule B annexed hereto and made a part hereof (the “Easement 
Area”); and 
WHEREAS, the parties recognize that GRANTEE has heretofore installed said storm 
drains within the Easement Area (the “Storm Drains”); and 
WHEREAS, in or about April 2015, the GRANTOR received permits for the demolition 
and reconstruction of the single-family home at the Premises, the approval for which provided that 
the Storm Drains were to be protected and preserved and that no development was to take place 
 
2 
 
within the Easement Area; and 
 WHEREAS, in performing such work, the GRANTOR caused to be installed on the 
Premises, certain improvements which were not approved by the Village, and which encroach 
upon and/or are located within the Easement Area including, but not limited to the following: 
asphalt concrete driveway extension, cobblestone curbing, large ornamental boulders, permanent 
mounted basketball hoop, heavy stone retaining wall, and soil fill of approximate depth ranging 
between two and four feet, (collectively, the “Encroachments”); and  
WHEREAS, said Encroachments obstruct GRANTEE’S access to the Storm Drains and 
ability to freely maintain same; and  
WHEREAS, the Easement Area is identified as the “Drainage Easement” on that certain 
as-built survey prepared by Gabriel E. Senor, P.C. dated November 28, 2016, a copy of which is 
annexed hereto and made a part hereof as Schedule C (the “Survey”); and 
WHEREAS, the Survey also shows the Encroachments lying within the Drainage 
Easement thereon; and 
WHEREAS, GRANTOR acknowledges that said Encroachments contravene the 1976 
Easement and has requested permission of GRANTEE to allow the Encroachments to remain in 
place; and 
WHEREAS, the Parties wish to amend the 1976 Easement in accordance herewith. 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the sum of Ten ($10.00) Dollars paid by the 
GRANTEE to GRANTOR, the receipt and sufficiency whereof is hereby acknowledged by 
GRANTOR, and in consideration of the mutual premises contained herein, the Parties hereto agree 
as follows: 
1. 
GRANTOR hereby ratifies and agrees to the terms and conditions, and rights and 
 
3 
 
obligations of the 1976 Easement as if fully set forth and incorporated herein, and subject to this 
Agreement. 
2. 
The Encroachments are hereby permitted to remain upon the Premises to the extent 
they presently exist as shown on the Survey and in accordance with the terms hereof. GRANTOR 
shall not install or locate any further or additional items within, or which may encroach upon the 
Easement Area including but not limited to buildings, decks, patios, walls, pools, ponds, fencing, 
driveways, or any other structures of any kind. 
3. 
In the event GRANTEE wishes to access the Storm Drains, then GRANTEE shall 
use reasonable efforts to give GRANTOR notice thereof, as provided herein, whereupon 
GRANTOR shall remove, at its own cost and expense the Encroachments as necessary in 
GRANTEE’S sole and absolute discretion to accommodate GRANTEE’S access to and work 
within the Easement Area.  GRANTEE shall have no liability to GRANTOR to restore any of the 
Encroachments to their original location or to any other location on the Premises. If after delivery 
of such notice, GRANTOR fails to remove any Encroachments from the Easement Area, 
GRANTEE shall be permitted to remove any and all Encroachments and/or any portion thereof 
from the Easement Area as it shall deem necessary in order to access and maintain the Storm 
Drains.  Any Encroachments so removed shall be moved temporarily to other locations on the 
Premises. GRANTEE’S restoration obligations after performing such work shall be limited to 
rough grading the Easement Area. GRANTOR shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for 
returning such relocated Encroachments to their original location and restoration of the Easement 
Area in connection with same. 
4. 
GRANTEE shall pay all costs in connection with its access to and maintenance of 
the Storm Drains, except however, GRANTOR shall reimburse GRANTEE for any and all 
 
4 
 
additional costs incurred by GRANTEE as a result of the location of the Encroachments within 
the Easement Area including the costs of removal of the Encroachments or any parts thereof from 
the Easement Area.  GRANTOR shall pay all such additional costs to GRANTEE within fifteen 
(15) days of GRANTEE’S delivery to GRANTOR of an invoice therefor in an amount as shall be 
determined by GRANTEE in its sole and absolute opinion. Any sum which is not so paid shall 
become a lien against the Premises collectable in the same manner as real property taxes.  
5. 
GRANTEE shall have sole and absolute authority to determine the means and 
methods of access to and maintenance of the Storm Drains. 
6. 
GRANTEE shall have no responsibility or obligation to protect, preserve, re-install 
or replace any of the Encroachments or any portions thereof as may be removed by GRANTEE in 
connection with GRANTEE’S access to and maintenance of the Storm Drains. 
7. 
GRANTEE’S restoration obligation upon maintaining the Storm Drains shall be 
limited to rough grading those portions of  the Easement Area disturbed by said work. 
8. 
Except as amended herein, the terms and conditions of the 1976 Easement shall 
remain in full force and effect. 
9. 
The provisions hereof shall run with the land and be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Parties hereto, their respective heirs, legal representative, 
successors and assigns, and the failure of any of them to enforce any provisions herein contained 
shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to do so thereafter.

The Village of Scarsdale has been a member of the Westchester County Refuse Disposal District 
#1 (District) for nearly 40 years.  The District contracts with RESCO Corporation to operate a 
Resource Recovery Facility (RRF) located in Peekskill, NY. Beginning in 1992, the Material 
Recovery Facility (MRF) began operation and receives all recyclables. The District is funded 
through refuse Tipping Fees on a per ton basis, as well as the levy of an ad valorem District Tax 
on all residents residing within the member municipalities. Recyclables have no Tipping Fee. 
 
The District maintains three regional transfer stations, and the Village transports our Municipally 
Collected Solid Waste (MSW) to the White Plains location for weighing and subsequent District 
transport to the RRF. Under the IMA, each municipality is obligated to dispose of all of their 
MSC through the District, subject to minimum and maximum limits. The Tipping Fee for refuse 
is currently $29.28 per ton, which adjusts annually up or down in response to the Consumer Price 
Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The next annual adjustment would be October 2020, if 
the IMA is approved by the Village Board. 
 
The existing IMA was for a ten-year period expiring October 21, 2019, providing for a five-year 
extension at the County’s discretion. The County now wishes to extend the Agreement through 
October 21, 2024, subject to the same terms and conditions as the original agreement, but for the 
following amendments:  
 
 Institutes a penalty for a recyclables reject level in excess of 10% of the gross weight of 
the delivery, a fine which is unlikely to impact our operation, but would equal the refuse 
Tipping Fee for the same load if applied ($29.28 per ton at present); 
 
 A food waste recycling program is authorized pursuant to separate agreement; and 
 
 The Village shall ensure that its solid waste and recyclables transportation vehicles are 
sealed and do not leak or otherwise discharge leachate or liquid from the vehicle other 
than on the tipping floor.  
 
Staff recommends approval and requests that the attached resolution and proposed IMA receive 
Village Board consideration at their meeting on June 09, 2020.

Support  For  Two Installment Payments For School Taxes
CAUTION: External sender. 
To :  The Scarsdale Village Board  
 
We strongly  support  and urge the  Scarsdale  Village  
Board of Trustees to vote in favor  of TWO  INSTALLMENT 
PAYMENTS FOR SCARSDALE  SCHOOL TAXES by our  
Scarsdale Taxpayers . One payment would be made in September,2020 
and one payment would be made in January , 2021  with no penalties. 
 
Our understanding is that every other Town in Westchester  has had this practice 
for years .  In fact the Scarsdale school families  that live in the Mamaroneck 
strip have been making two school tax payments for years . 
 
Time is short during the pandemic  economic downturn  so we urge the Village Board to vote 
TONIGHT  to approve the TWO PAYMENT PLAN FOR SCARSDALE  SCHOOL TAXES . 
 
Approval of the INSTALLMENT PLAN  will help with the approval of the  School Board's   
budget vote to be held by 5 PM on Tuesday ,  June 9.  The next Village Board  meeting will 
not take place until after  the School Budget  Vote at 7 PM  on June 9th . 
 
Thank you for your  important consideration of this matter.

Public Comments 
 
          Mr. Samwick opened the second public comment session at this time. 
 
 
B. Kathleen Munguia, 58 Brookby Road, stated that she wanted to encourage residents 
to reuse, recycle and repurpose, that it just makes good sense.  
 
As a member of a group of Girl Scout leaders, Ms. Munguia stated that when there is a 
discussion with respect to the possible reopening and use by the Village of the Girl Scout House 
that the local Girl Scout community be involved with the safe reopening of it. They anticipate, as 
a community, the need for the house for many Girl Scouts, who they feel are not going to be 
going away this summer, and if they can plan some safe programming in small groups. They want 
to make sure that they can again use the Girl Scout House, which has been closed since March. 
 
Ms. Munguia stated that as citizen and resident of Scarsdale, that while this evening 
Trustee Lewis seem to have been the only one who received thank yous for his ‘no’ vote on the 
Village budget, she would like to thank the Mayor and the other five Trustees who voted yes on 
the proposed budget, which was crafted after thoughtful review and careful consideration of all 
of our residents suggestions over many public meetings.  That some residents’ suggestions may 
have not been taken, does not mean that their voices are not heard or their suggestions were not 
considered.  She stated that she is grateful for this Board’s dedicated service to the community 
and she applauded the incredible hard work of the staff, led by the Village Manager Steve 
Pappalardo; she thanked everyone. 
 
Mayra Kirkendall Rodriguez, Fox Meadow Road, stated that it was fantastic to hear 
from B.K. Munguia, a fellow Texan from San Antonio.  She stated that every Trustee should be 
thanked for his and her willingness to step up and serve.  However, she stated that she is very 
biased toward Trustee Lewis because he has the chops to ask the hard questions. Where was the 
documentation, and where were the various numbers to prove that there were ever was a stress 
test on this budget. 
 
Ms. Kirkendall Rodriguez stated that she is in concurrence with Ms. Munguia that she 
hopes that they find a way to open up the Girl Scout House.  She stated that she is not involved 
with the Girl Scouts, but that she is an assistant to the Cub Scouts here in Scarsdale, and her 
husband is a Cub Scout Master and she is the first leader of the first Girl Scouts den.  She 
concurred with Village Manager Pappalardo that time and with the proper procedures and 
processes, all of that will happen, and she looked forward to that.  She stated that she appreciated 
everybody’s efforts to try to slowly reopen the economy, which is absolutely devastating to so 
many people, including those here in Scarsdale.  She stated that she continues to be concerned 
with remarks from the Village Board of Trustees that they want to do everything they can to help 
the residents and although she appreciated those remarks, they should have never passed a 
budget where you ignored over 305 residents who signed a petition asking the Village to  
lower the tax burden.  She stated that she appreciated Trustee Arest’s respect for data, but she 
wanted to hear from him what other data he could possibly want; residents have sent in data and 
she sent in the data.  She noted that the Scarsdale Inquirer published an editorial piece on Friday 
stating that the Board should have listened to residents, but the Board ignored the feedback. 
 
Ms. Kirkendall Rodriguez thanked the Village Board for their time and thanked the 
Voters Choice Party, noting that they have done an amazing job.  She stated that she is stepping 
down as the campaign chair because she is running for the School Board.

Mayor Samwick stated that this meeting is not a forum for political statements but that 
they appreciate Ms. Kirkendall Rodriguez volunteering to run for public office. 
 
Robert Berg, 32 Tisdale Road, stated that the more he researched the two installment 
property tax billing over the past few weeks, the more frustrated he became with the Village 
Board and its predecessor boards.  He stated that every single Town board in Westchester 
County, besides the Town of Scarsdale has adopted the two installment, no penalty School tax 
billing plan for taxpayers, and he believed most of them have done so years ago.  He stated that 
this provides great cash flow flexibility and for taxpayers, the School tax is the largest payment 
most residents pay, other than their income tax bills each year.  When they're required to do so in 
one lump sum it often becomes very challenging for taxpayers to come up with the money.  The 
two part payment plan cuts them a four month break, requiring them only to pay 50% in 
September and 50% four months later.  Additionally, the plan allows them to avoid the loan 
shark-like penalties or at least to minimize them.   That is why every single town in Westchester 
and the cities of Rye, Peekskill, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and White Plains have 
implemented this plan.  There's no question that this Board must implement this program for the 
School tax and there's no time to waste, so that the residents can take advantage of this plan for 
this year’s School tax. 
 
Mr. Berg continued, stating that the Board should do the same two installment payment 
plan for the Village tax as well.  His research also shows that many Villages and Cities also allow 
two installment payments for their taxes as well, including Portchester, Rye Brook, Mamaroneck, 
Bronxville, Ossining, Pleasantville, Briarcliff Manor, Hastings-on-Hudson, Sleepy Hollow, 
Irvington, Mt. Kisco, Harrison.  All of these Villages have a two part installment plan for their 
The Cities of Peekskill, Mt. Veron and White Plains has a two payment installment plan for the 
City taxes.    
 
Mr. Berg stated that the Board must look into doing the same for the Village taxes, as 
time is really short with that, although he didn’t know the exact way this was done; a request may 
have to be sent to the Governor to issue an executive order.  However, he stated that he felt that 
the Board should do this immediately and that they should enlist Senator Stewart-Cousins and 
Assemblywoman Paulin in that endeavor. 
 
 
Nicholas Thompson, 1 Forest Lane, stated that he was interested to hear earlier in the 
meeting about the local businesses downtown and was hoping that on the Village website that  
there could be a listing of what stores are open and what kind of services they are doing or 
offering because that would be helpful to folks  
 
Mr. Thompson stated that although he is aware that right now the library lot is closed, he 
wanted to know if whether or not the library website should have something stating when they 
will be reopening and also in what capacity; whether it will be 25%, 50%, and also what they will 
need residents to do in regard to masks, etc. 
 
Mr. Thompson continued, stating that he wrote a letter to the Scarsdale Inquirer  
concerning the Village budget and that he was very concerned that the Board is not listening to 
the residents who are begging for relief in these very uncertain times.   He stated that there are 
some people who are out of work, and there are folks that have been retired for years that are 
having issues trying to figure out whether they want to stay here or whether they will have to 
move because of increased taxes.  He stated that he hoped that the Board would understand that 
it is the taxpayers who actually pay the salaries of the people who work for the Town, and he 
T o w n  B o a r d  M e e t i n g  0 5 / 1 2 / 2 0 2 0  
 
P a g e  | 886 
 
 
hoped that they would learn to respect that fact and that we as Town residents are not a dime in a 
piggy bank that they can get out year after year after year and expect us to go willingly 
 
Robert Harrison, 65 Fox Meadow Road, stated that Alison Singer, the Vice President of 
the School Board took the lead on writing the Village Board to promote the two installment 
payments for the School taxes.  He thanked Ms. Singer publicly.  He noted that the President of 
the School Board, Pamela Fuehrer, did a terrific job in leading the School Board discussion last 
night and he spoke with her today and he stated that they're having another meeting tomorrow 
on their budget. 
 
Mr. Harrison thanked Mr. Thompson for his comments, noting that he spoke at the 
School Board meeting last night, and again at tonight’s Board meeting.  He stated that Mr. 
Thompson is one of the younger members of our community and he is very thoughtful.  Mr. 
Harrison stated that he hoped Mr. Thompson’s words will have an impact.  He asked that the 
Board have a workshop soon to discuss the two payment installment plan for the School taxes 
and strongly urged the Board to approve that.  He stated that just about every other community 
has been doing it. 
 
Mr. Harrison stated that there was a strong feeling in the community that the Village tax 
rate should not be increased, but it is too late now.  
 
Mr. Harrison asked if there were penalties for not paying the taxes by the end of April; is 
there a certain penalty for making a payment in May, and an additional penalty for making a 
payment in June. 
 
Mr. Harrison continued, stating that last Friday, unemployment rates spiked to 14.7%, 
which is much higher than it was back in the great recession of 2008.  The unemployment claims 
are now up to 33 million people; it's a disaster out there.  Scarsdale is not immune to what's going 
on across the nation and it is too bad that the Board could not see a way to have no tax increase. 
However, he stated that he is sure the Board will be working during the year to be efficient.  In 
addition, there are a lot of difficult decisions to make on the summer camp and other things.  
 
Mr. Harrison thanked the Mayor and the Board for all the time and work they are putting 
in.   He emphasized shared sacrifice by everybody, and that the Board should think of the 
taxpayers who have supported the Village and the School for all the years that they have lived 
here.  
 
Mayor Samwick stated that he had a couple of comments to clarify a few things, first with 
respect to the two installments for the School tax.  He stated that this is not the first time that 
this topic has been brought up; it is brought up periodically, and the approach that the Village 
Board has taken every time is to be collaborative with the School district.  The Board clearly 
recognizes that there are impacts on the School district.  In fact, you don't have to look that far 
back to see a $1 million plus swing interest income to the School district as a result of having one 
payment instead of two.  So clearly, getting the letter we received just late this afternoon from the 
School District, having the School District support such a move is, the way that the Board is 
approaching this and looking at it in a way that is constructive and collaborative as the Board 
always does.  The taxpayers are of paramount importance to the Board, as is with the School 
District.   When they work together on items like this, they are going to get a much better 
outcome.  This is not something that the Village Board felt should be done in a vacuum. 
 
T o w n  B o a r d  M e e t i n g  0 5 / 1 2 / 2 0 2 0  
 
P a g e  | 887 
 
 
Mayor Samwick also clarified that all penalties, whether someone wants to refer to them 
as loan shark-like or not, are really mandated by the State. These are not something that are 
determined by this Board or any other Village Board.  That is something that we all live with and 
he stated that, by the way, he didn’t want to lose that point either, that we are all taxpayers and 
these things matter to us as well. If we're able to look at the impacts and find that it is beneficial 
to move to installment payments for the School tax and the Village tax that is something that 
benefits all of us if it's something that is achievable. The Board has been working with Counsel 
and with others to look into what options exist for exactly these things, and these are things that 
the Board has been, and will continue to work on. 
 
Mayor Samwick noted that there was a question about the reopening of the Library Loft. 
He stated that these are decisions that are going to come with the reopening of the economy and 
the reopening of everything that we do, in order to follow the Governor's lead. 
 
With regard to Mr. Harrison’s statement that the School District reduced the tax levy and 
he praised the School for reducing the tax levy from 1.99% to 1.49% -  as coincidental as this 
seems the Village did exactly the same thing.  We found some tax savings that we did pass along 
to our residents and we did initially have a 1.98% increase in the budget that we were able to 
reduce to 1.46%.  Everything that the Village Board is doing, the School District is doing, with 
residents and taxpayers at the forefront of their minds.  They are keenly aware and as individuals 
are not immune to what's going on in the COVID-19 economy that we're living in right now. 
 
Trustee Veron thanked Nicholas Thompson for his sincere care for our merchants and 
our business community; obviously they're essential to the fabric of our community and having 
residents support the business communities is so greatly appreciated by our merchants.  She 
noted that he asked about a listing at the last meeting.  She stated that the Scarsdale Business 
Alliance provided for provisional membership for all of 10583 businesses and they are building a 
website so that you can get exactly the information that you're seeking.  They will be speaking 
again about that when they meet as a collaborative group on Thursday.  She stated that it was a 
great suggestion and they are working on it.   
 
Trustee Arest stated that he wanted to make two points.  He stated that he thinks that 
there's a misconception that automatically going to two installments means fewer penalties and 
interest.  He stated that it is very possible that this will be the outcome; we will see after they 
move forward.  When he started to look into this and find data to back up whatever decision the 
Board makes, if you were to convert the actual penalties and interest collected from Bronxville in 
1920 and you did that based on population size or parcel size, they collected more interest in 
penalties than we did in 1920.  This is just to compare one Village to another.  Obviously the 
Board shouldn't make hasty decisions in a panic or in fear without better information going to 
partial payments for the Village right now.  It might be a good idea; however, he would be a little 
hesitant without a lot of further analysis looking into it, and this is one of the things he hoped to 
discuss at the Board’s next work session because while he thought it would be imprudent to 
advocate for such a change permanently, there is the ability to have conditions on such a change. 
He stated that he would be in favor of this personally, but he is one of seven; however he would 
be in favor of looking to do something like that for this year as a condition of hardship for one 
year only.  If it's going to benefit the residents, where it gets a little more complicated.  He stated 
that they can talk about this more at the work session, but he stated that the Counties are able to 
then opt out of the interest and penalties on the second payment, and the Village would not be 
able to do that without another executive order or an act of the assembly, etc., so it gets a little 
T o w n  B o a r d  M e e t i n g  0 5 / 1 2 / 2 0 2 0  
 
P a g e  | 888 
 
 
more complicated.  He stated that he looked forward to discussing this at the work session in two 
weeks. 
 
As there were no further public comments offered, Mr. Samwick stated that he would like 
to close the second public comment period and move on to the future meeting schedule.

Re: 
School and Village Tax Collection Installments 
As you know, the Scarsdale School and Village Boards have publically discussed modifying 
the existing annual School District (District) tax billing and collection process, by providing 
for a second collection period for 50% of the School tax bill. The purpose of adding the 
second collection period is to reduce the financial burden on Village tax payers during the 
COVID-19 crisis when the income of certain resident property owners may have been 
adversely effected.  In consideration of this proposed operational change I offer the following.   
Over the past few decades, the District has been approached more than once and has 
considered collecting school taxes in two installments but has declined each time for 
budgetary purposes. The Village guarantees 100% of the tax levy to the District who in turn 
invests the proceeds, relative to cash flow needs, and budgets the interest income from these 
investments. While investment rates are currently at or near historic lows, depending on the 
interest rate environment, interest income has been a significant source of revenue for the 
District. The current 2019-2020 District levy is roughly $140 million. Assuming that the 
Town of Scarsdale collects 94% of the levy in the first month, and assuming that the second 
half school tax was collected in January, the District would lose roughly $438,000 over a four 
month period if interest rates were at 2%. 
The fiscal impact on the Village is related to penalties on late payments, which for FY18-19 
totaled $198,235.  A total of $500,000 is budgeted in the current year FY19-20 budget and 
$525,000 in the FY20-21 budget.  Penalty income is derived from delinquent Village, County 
and School tax payments as well as penalties on liens. Although this impact is less both in 
dollars and percentage of the overall budgetary revenues as compared to the District, it is still 
an important part of the Village revenue. Revenue from penalties would drop both for the first 
installment and the second installment.  
Operationally for the Village Treasurer’s Office the staff would add another collection to the 
annual schedule. The Village staff is already in collection for the following months: June, July, 
August, September, November, January, February, April and May. Water bills are prepared in 
Village of Scarsdale 
 Page 2 
July, October, January and April and tax bills are prepared in March, June and August.  
Adding another tax collection will require moving to a lockbox operation or hiring additional 
part-time or seasonal staff.   
There are also tax collection software issues with a second collection. I have spoken to our 
representative at Software Consulting Associates about the proposal to collect school taxes in 
two installments. The conversion for the District collection can be achieved without additional 
cost for the software. We are waiting for an estimate on the redesign of the tax bill. If 
approved, the two installments would be collected in September and in January. 
Presuming we convert to two school tax installments, I would recommend that we convert all 
tax collections to the use of a lockbox. This would add cost to the process but would make the 
work manageable without adding another staff position. Based on current lockbox rates, I 
would estimate that we would pay between $2,200 and $3,000 for each lockbox collection. 
We would continue to offer online payments and accept over-the-counter collections once 
Village Hall reopens to the public again.  Please know that we process between 450 and 800 
payments over-the-counter in the last few days of a tax collection. Mail receipts are 
approximately the same in the last few collection days. 
A customer service impact is that conversion to a lockbox would very likely eliminate our 
ability to review mailed checks for errors near the end of the month. Currently we review 
payments and contact homeowners if there is time to make adjustments to try to avoid 
penalties for our taxpayers. Checks mailed directly to a lockbox may not be received at 
Village Hall in time to reach out to our taxpayers to make corrections. 
Finally, we are also looking into the possible collection of Village taxes in two installments. 
This change would impact Village cash flow, interest income and penalty revenue.  
Village tax bills are mailed at the end of June for collection from July 1 through August 1 
without penalty. At this point, December is the only month available for an additional 
collection. I have spoken with our software representative about the possibility of splitting the 
collection and whether or not there is sufficient time to make the software changes. The 
majority of our software provider’s customers bill taxes in June, limiting the provider’s 
availability to make the necessary software and bill format changes for a July 1 billing. That 
being the case, I heard back from the vendor this week and they are able to make the necessary 
software changes in time for the July 2020 tax billing.
