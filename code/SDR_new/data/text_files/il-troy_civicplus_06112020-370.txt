On or about June 15, 2020, the City of Troy intends to apply to the Illinois Department of Commerce 
and Economic Opportunity for a grant from the Rebuild Illinois program.  This program is funded by 
state funds as included in the 2019 Capital Bill.  These funds are to be used for a community 
development project that will include the following activities: replacement of equipment and upgrades 
to buildings at the City’s wastewater treatment plant.  The total amount of Rebuild Illinois funds to be 
requested is $565,705. The City of Troy also proposes to expend $588,795 in non-Rebuild Illinois 
funds on the project.  These non-Rebuild Illinois funds will be derived from the following sources: 
Sewer Fund - $588,795.
