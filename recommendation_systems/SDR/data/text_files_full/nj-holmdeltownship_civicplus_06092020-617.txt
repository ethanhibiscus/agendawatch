TOWNSHIP OF HOLMDEL
COUNTY OF MONMOUTH
RESOLUTION PERMITTING CERTAIN TEMPORARY SIGNAGE WITHIN 
THE TOWNSHIP OF HOLMDEL
WHEREAS, pursuant to Executive Order, Governor Phil Murphy has declared a 
State of Emergency and Public Health Emergency to address the Coronavirus Pandemic; 
and
WHEREAS, due to this State of Emergency and Public Health Emergency, to 
date, non-essential retail businesses have been restricted in their operations, including in 
some cases to limited curbside activity; and
WHEREAS, certain businesses and/or their landlords have requested to post 
signage expressing that they are open for business notwithstanding the ongoing 
restrictions due to the Coronavirus Pandemic; and
WHEREAS, the Township Committee of the Township of Holmdel seeks to 
further the effectiveness of the Governor’s Executive Orders by suspending operation of 
certain ordinance restrictions on signs to allow for the foregoing disseminations, which it 
finds to be a compelling government interest. 
   
          NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Township Committee of the 
Township of Holmdel, as follows:
1. The Township Committee hereby authorizes the suspension of the enforcement of 
all provisions of Holmdel Township’s ordinances restricting signage, including 
but not limited to Ordinance § 30-96 (Signs) (the “Suspension”), consistent with 
the following terms. 
2. The Suspension is sanctioned only to the extent appropriate to allow entities to 
articulate information relating to their restricted operations due to and consistent 
with the restrictions imposed by the State of Emergency and Public Health 
Emergency.  
3. A person or entity with control over property may apply to the Township 
Administrator with a written request to temporarily post a sign on their property. 
The written request shall include its purpose, the dimensions of the proposed sign, 
and its proposed location. The Township Administrator is authorized to approve 
such a written request, provided it satisfies the requirements of Paragraph 2 of this 
resolution and does not present as a health, safety, or welfare concern.

4.
The Township Administrator, in consultation with the Township Attorney, 
Construction Official, and Chief of Police, is hereby authorized and directed to 
take any and all steps necessary to effectuate the foregoing. 
5. This resolution shall take effect immediately and expire along with any 
authorizations therefrom seven (7) days after the Governor’s State of Emergency 
and Public Health Emergency relating to Coronavirus is rescinded or modified in 
a manner that allows for the resumption of business operations that are no longer 
restricted, whichever occurs first.
6. If any section, subsection, or paragraph of this resolution be declared 
unconstitutional, invalid or inoperative, in whole or in part, by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the resolution shall continue in full force 
and effect to the extent that is not held unconstitutional, invalid or inoperative.

WHEREAS, pursuant to Executive Orders 103, 119, and 138, Governor Phil 
Murphy has declared a State of Emergency and Public Health Emergency to address the 
Coronavirus Pandemic; and
WHEREAS, due to this State of Emergency and Public Health Emergency, to 
date, local restaurants have been ordered to limit their businesses to takeout and delivery 
of food; and
WHEREAS, Governor Murphy has issued Executive Order 150 (the “EO”), 
which authorizes the commencement of outdoor dining effective June 15, 2020; and
WHEREAS, the EO provides that “[m]unicipalities are permitted to use their 
existing authority to allow food or beverage establishments to expand their footprint to 
outdoor areas, both within their property and among municipally-governed areas, 
including but not limited to sidewalks, streets, or parks;” and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the EO and a municipality’s general police powers 
referenced in same, the Township Committee of the Township of Holmdel seeks to 
facilitate outdoor dining by restaurants within the Township of Holmdel, in order to 
provide these businesses and their customers with the opportunity to resume in-person 
dining, while adhering to necessary safety precautions; and
WHEREAS, recognizing that the State of Emergency and Public Health 
Emergency continues to evolve, with new Executive Orders and guidance issued on a 
regular basis, the Township Committee further seeks to delegate various authority to the 
Township Administrator and other municipal officials to effectuate the foregoing.
   
          NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Township Committee of the 
Township of Holmdel, as follows:
1. The Township Committee hereby authorizes the temporary allowance of outdoor 
dining by “food or beverage establishments” (as defined in the EO) (“Outdoor 
Dining”) within the Township of Holmdel, effective June 15, 2020. This

                                                      2020-187
hereof, as may be amended from time to time, as well as all applicable state 
regulations, as may be amended from time to time, including but not limited to the 
EO, other Executive Orders entered by Governor Murphy, and Executive 
Directive No. 20-014 entered by the Commissioner of the Department of Health 
Judith Persichilli (collectively, the “Outdoor Dining Standards”).
3. All food or beverage establishments seeking to conduct Outdoor Dining must 
complete an application to the Township and obtain an Outdoor Dining 
Temporary Permit prior to the commencement of any Outdoor Dining service. 
The application shall require a certification that the food or beverage 
establishment will comply at all times with the Outdoor Dining Standards. 
4. Applications for an Outdoor Dining Temporary Permit shall be reviewed by a 
Township “Temporary Use Permit Approval Committee,” which shall be 
comprised of three members of the Holmdel Township Police Department 
designated by the Chief of Police, the Code Enforcement Officer, Fire 
Official/Zoning Officer, and Construction Official. All determinations of the 
Temporary Use Permit Approval Committee shall be final. 
5. The Township Committee authorizes a waiver of all fees provided in ordinance 
that would otherwise be applicable to a request to conduct Outdoor Dining. 
6. The Township Committee authorizes the Temporary Use Permit Approval 
Committee to approve the use of “outdoor shared spaces” (as defined in the EO) 
to allow for Outdoor Dining, upon terms consistent with the EO.

has issued Special Ruling 2020-10, establishing a Temporary Covid-19 Permit to 
Expand Licensed Premises (“ABC COVID License”), allowing certain alcohol 
license holders under Title 33 (Alcoholic Beverage Law) to apply for and obtain 
and expanded premises to allow for Outdoor Dining. The Township Committee 
hereby authorizes the municipal approval of applications for an ABC COVID 
License without further action of the governing body, provided the licensee has 
already obtained an Outdoor Dining Temporary Permit from the Township, and 
the licensee’s application to the ABC is consonant with its application to the 
Township for the Outdoor Dining Temporary Permit. The Township Clerk and 
Chief of Police are specifically authorized and directed to approve applications 
for an ABC COVID License, in consultation with the Temporary Use Permit 
Approval Committee. 
8. If the Township provides an approval for an ABC COVID License pursuant to the 
preceding paragraph, the license holder shall provide appropriate levels of 
security, signage, and trash receptacles to ensure that no open containers of 
alcohol are taken from the expanded premise. This requirement shall be a 
condition upon the Outdoor Dining Temporary Permit and a special condition 
upon the licensee’s Title 33 license.

Construction Official, and Chief of Police, is hereby authorized and directed to 
take any and all steps necessary to effectuate the foregoing. This authorization 
includes delegated authority to adopt modifications to the Outdoor Dining 
Standards during the pendency between meetings of the Township Committee to

Holmdel Township Park Partners
The goal of the Holmdel Township Park Partners Program is to build a sense 
of community, pride and ownership around every park, trail and public space.  
This is a volunteer public service program that encourages Holmdel 
organizations and individuals to make significant contributions toward 
maintaining the high quality of Holmdel's public space. By participating, you 
contribute to a cleaner environment in your neighborhood and you allow the 
Township to conserve and redirect resources.
Becoming a Park Partner is a great way for local groups, individuals or 
organizations to get involved in the community. Partners help keep the parks 
safe and clean. This can be done through individual efforts, small group 
parties, or large community events.
How do I become a Park Partner?

Fill out a Holmdel Township Park Partners Application

Set up a meeting with the Holmdel Township Park Partners Coordinator to discuss 
adoption details and create a park work plan based on adopted park and group 
needs

Receive Township approved Work Plan signed by Township representative and 
Partner prior to beginning project

Complete outlined tasks
What types of tasks and projects can be done in parks, trails and 
public spaces?
There are many different projects for Partners. Each space has different needs and weather 
and time of year also play a role in determining park projects as each season brings different 
challenges. 
Examples of typical projects:

Litter pick up

Trail Maintenance

Graffiti removal

Flower planting and landscape bed 
maintenance

Pruning

Commitments vary depending on the project proposal and written work plan agreement.  
Projects can last one day or through the course of an entire year.  No project will last longer 
than a calendar year.  Partners wishing to continue work should reapply each year.  
Is it free to become a Park Partner?
It is free; however, time commitments are needed to complete outlined tasks.  
This is a volunteer program and no monetary compensation will be made by the Township.  
The Township may provide supplies and equipment necessary to complete the outlined 
tasks.

procedures will be removed from the program.  

Under no circumstances shall work be completed without a signed work plan 
agreement and proper waivers being submitted.

The parks/trails/spaces will be assigned to groups on a first-come, first-served basis to 
be determined by the Park Partners Coordinator.

Each group will receive volunteer waiver forms that must be completed annually and 
prior to any work being started.  

Work is to be completed during park hours only.
