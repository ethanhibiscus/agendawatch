NOTICE OF PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING 
 
The Royal Oak Planning Commission will hold a regular meeting on Tuesday, June 9, 2020 at 7:00 p.m. 
 
On March 10, 2020, Governor Whitmer issued Executive Order 2020-04, which declared a state-wide state of 
emergency due to the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus 
that had not been previously identified in humans, can spread easily from person to person, and can result in 
serious illness or death. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, to protect the public health, and provide essential 
protections to vulnerable Michiganders, it is crucial that all Michiganders take steps to limit in-person contact. 
The critical mitigation measures include social distancing and limiting the number of people interacting at public 
gatherings. Therefore, the June 9, 2020 Royal Oak Planning Commission meeting will be held electronically, 
in compliance with the Michigan Open Meetings Act and Executive Order 2020-75, as issued by Governor 
Whitmer on May 6, 2020. 
 
Members of the public may watch the meeting in either of the following ways: on WROK, the city’s municipal 
access cable channel (Wide Open West channel 10 or Comcast / Xfinity channel 17); or at WROK’s live web 
stream https://www.romi.gov/523/Live-Stream-and-Video-on-Demand. 
 
Members of the public may participate in the meeting electronically by providing public comment on any 
planning-related matter, whether on the agenda or not. To participate in public comment please call (248) 246-
3411 between the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. on Monday, June 8, 2020, and leave a recorded

public comment portion of the meeting on non-agenda items, or the public hearing for individual agenda items, 
and your recorded message will be played as part of the meeting broadcast. Public comments will be limited 
to three (3) minutes per person. If you exceed the three-minute limit only the first three minutes will be played 
for meeting broadcast. If you call multiple times only your first comment will be played.
