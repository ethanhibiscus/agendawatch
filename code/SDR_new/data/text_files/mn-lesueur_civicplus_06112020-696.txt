LE SUEUR PLANNING COMMISSION 
MEETING MINUTES 
Thursday, April 9, 2020 
 
 
 
A meeting of the Planning Commission was held on Thursday, April 9, 2020 at 6:00 p.m. via virtual 
meeting with the following Planning Commissioners in attendance: John Dieball, Colleen Johnson, 
Melissa Huntington, Jack Roberts and Dan Ryerson. Commissioners absent: Andrea Faches, and 
Julie Sheehy. Samantha DiMaggio, Community Development Director, and Newell Krogmann, 
Council Liaison, were also in attendance. 
 
A motion was made by Commissioner Ryerson, seconded by Commissioner Johnson, to approve 
the agenda as written. Commissioners Voting in favor: Roberts, Ryerson, Johnson, and Dieball. 
Commissioners Voting no: None. Motion carried. 
 
A motion was made by Commissioner Johnson, seconded by Commissioner Ryerson to approve 
the minutes from the March 12, 2020 meeting. Commissioners Voting in favor: Roberts, Ryerson, 
Johnson, and Dieball. Commissioners Voting no: None. Motion carried. 
 
Item 4.1, Public Hearing -- Comprehensive Plan Amendment: A motion by Commissioner Ryerson 
and seconded by Commissioner Dieball to open the public hearing. Commissioners Voting in favor: 
Roberts, Ryerson, Johnson, and Dieball. Commissioners Voting no: None. Motion carried. 
 
Planning Commissioner Huntington joined the meeting at this time.  
 
Staff reviewed proposed changes to the Chapter 4 of the Comprehensive Plan. These revisions are 
intended to have more specific land use categories that interface with the City’s updated Zoning 
Districts.  Also included with these revisions is an extra-territorial land use planning map that 
identifies areas of likely growth and then assigns land uses to these areas. The map categorizes 
appropriate uses on properties identified as having the potential for annexation.  This will make it 
possible for the City to establish future transportation and utility systems in these areas if a property 
owner were to wish to pursue annexation and development. A motion was made by Commissioner 
Johnson, seconded by Commissioner Ryerson, to close the public hearing.  
 
A motion was made by Commissioner Ryerson, seconded by Commissioner Roberts, to adopt the

Purpose
The Le Sueur 2040 Comprehensive Plan, completed in 2016, recommended the creation of a Downtown Master Plan as one 
of its action steps. This Plan directly responds to that call, building on the momentum of the Comprehensive Planning process and 
channelling its energy into a defined direction for future development. This document:
»
» Evaluates redevelopment and reuse needs and demonstrates opportunities for new development aligned with the creation of 
new downtown housing opportunities, new office opportunities, niche retail/services and civic attractions
»
» Builds a stronger understanding of how Valley Green Square Mall can be reconfigured to re-open Main Street to vehicular traffic, 
while retaining the existing retail and office users
»
» Provides examples of streetscape design and development character so that Le Sueur can retain its small-town, traditional 
downtown feel with new development
»
» Identifies opportunities for investment in public improvements that strengthen connections to adjacent neighborhoods and 
enhance the pedestrian environment (walkability and bikeability) 
»
» Identifies locations for organized civic events, activities, and gathering places that bring more people into downtown for 
entertainment and festivities
»
» Devises strategies for how redevelopment can occur

Navigating the Le Sueur Downtown Master Plan
The Project Background and Existing Conditions chapters of this Master Plan set up the current state of Le Sueur’s downtown, 
reviewing the constraints and opportunities that shape the proposals in the Downtown Master Plan chapter. The Downtown Master 
Plan chapter breaks proposed improvements into the following five categories:
1.	Downtown Districts, Land Use, and Redevelopment Scenarios:
The plan draws distinctions between different areas of downtown and works to ensure that their land uses make sense, given 
potential redevelopment opportunities. An exploration of the Valley Green Square Mall property is included in this section.
2.	Downtown Development Character Initiatives
This section outlines commercial, residential, and employment initiatives that will help to achieve a development character that 
is compatible with each district and the intended overall vision for downtown. 
3.	Transportation and Wayfinding
The plan considers the implications of transportation on redevelopment, and outlines initiatives for streets, parking, signage, and 
gateway elements. These strengthen wayfinding, organize travel within downtown, and improve broader connections to it.
4.	Parks, Trails, and Open Space
This section explores ways to tie Le Sueur to its riverfront amenities, connect downtown to a regional trail network, and create 
flexible spaces for markets and community events, with the goal of creating a healthy, vibrant downtown.
5.	Community Reinvestment Strategies
Finally, the Downtown Master Plan approaches redevelopment through community reinvestment strategies. These 
recommended actions, policies, and procedures will guide downtown business development and help to create a destination 
that sustains businesses and celebrates local heritage.
The Implementation chapter outlines roles and responsibilities, along with specific initiatives, policies, projects, phasing, 
and financing tools that will enable Le Sueur to accomplish the vision outlined in this Master Plan in the coming years.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Le Sueur Downtown Master Plan
Takeaways from the Downtown Master Plan
Leverage for Change
Most residents of the region that visit Le Sueur know the downtown district for the partially vacant Valley Green Square Mall, in the 
heart of downtown, and how the mall’s development several decades ago closed Main Street, to the south of Bridge Street, making 
it more difficult to reach some of the stores and restaurants in the downtown area. Downtown Le Sueur is not currently known for 
having a notable roster of stores, destinations, or attractions that draw people from Mankato, the Twin Cities, or the communities in 
between. However, Downtown Le Sueur has the potential to leverage its adjacency to the US 169 corridor and its proximity to the 
growing Mankato and Twin Cities areas to attract more investment and visitation to the district over time. Drawing from examples 
of other successful small town downtowns in Minnesota and elsewhere in the Upper Midwest, Downtown Le Sueur can create the 
foundation to attract interest and visitation from out-of-towners and Le Sueur residents to live, work, and play in the district.
Re-opening Main Street + Mall Site Options
A key focus of city leaders over the next several years is likely to involve facilitating changes to the mall site and re-opening Main 
Street to through traffic, between Bridge Street and Ferry Street. The Master Plan calls for the city to collaborate with the county to 
integrate streetscape elements (such as street trees, enhanced lighting and seating, and other aesthetic improvements) along Main 
Street and other streets, to enhance the attractiveness of the district. The section of Main Street by the mall could also be used as 
a “festival street” that could be closed for key community events and festivals, and areas by the mall could also be repurposed as 
community gathering places. On the backside of the mall structure, the City has the potential to develop portions of the parking 
lot as residential uses, thus introducing additional vitality to the district and adding to the residential population around Downtown 
Le Sueur. The Master Plan outlines a variety of options for the actual mall structure, ranging from the renovation of existing space to 
outright demolition and the construction of new, mixed-use buildings (including retail, office, and possibly residential uses) fronting 
Main Street. Re-opening Main Street, in particular, will help with visibility from the outside, to interior portions of Downtown Le 
Sueur (along South Main, and along Ferry Street). The Main Street project has the opportunity to allow the community to begin re-
introducing the downtown to the broader base of residents and visitors in the Minnesota River valley.
Becoming a Destination
Beyond an initial focus on the mall site and re-opening Main Street, the master plan articulates a number of key initiatives to 
transform Downtown Le Sueur and enhance its marketability and recognition in the broader region. The City could partner 
with MnDOT to introduce enhanced wayfinding and signage along US 169, to advertise and direct visitors from the highway to 
Downtown. The completion of a new state trail along the river, connecting Downtown Le Sueur to Mankato to the south, and Belle 
Plaine to the north, has the potential to introduce a good deal of bike traffic into the district and raise the awareness of Downtown 
Le Sueur. The installation of downtown gateways, public art features, and bike and trail connections to the Minnesota River, coupled 
with a focus on creating and sustaining festivals and a full series of downtown programming and events, can further help make 
Downtown Le Sueur a destination in the broader region. At the same time the community is pursuing these various initiatives, civic 
leaders and city officials should continuously market the downtown district and pursue and work with prospective retail tenants and 
other users that would contribute to the vitality of the downtown district.
Commitment to Action
The Master Plan details a series of implementation tools and strategies, including financial programs and incentives, and outlines key 
roles and responsibilities for various stakeholders that will advance Downtown Le Sueur. The Downtown Master Plan emphasizes 
that the community must demonstrate ongoing and patient leadership and a commitment to ongoing actions, both big 
and small, to maintain the momentum of downtown revitalization and to continue to advance the vision for the district. 
While Downtown Le Sueur is often overlooked currently, it has the potential to emerge as a unique and compelling destination for 
residents of the city and well beyond, drawing from the energy and persistence of local leaders and the broader community.

Purpose
Le Sueur’s downtown is the historical focal point of the community, which has, in the 
transition from one millennium to the next, experienced a shift in its industry-based 
identity. With a small-town feel, a striking surrounding natural landscape, and a rich 
cultural history, Le Sueur has much to showcase. Planning over the past decade has 
identified updates to the downtown as the catalyst that could spark community 
development and renewed vibrancy. The Le Sueur 2040 Comprehensive Plan, 
completed in 2016, recommended the creation of a Downtown Master Plan as one 
of its action steps. This Plan directly responds to that call, building on the momentum 
of the Comprehensive Planning process and channelling that energy into a defined 
direction for future development. This document:

Le Sueur 2040 
Comprehensive 
Plan Vision
The City of Le 
Sueur in 2040 
will be defined 
by its convenient 
location, its rural 
character, its ample 
opportunities, and 
its ability to evolve 
with this ever-
changing world, 
but Le Sueur’s true 
essence lies in its 
vibrant community 
composed of 
people who are 
committed to make 
their City thrive.

Approach
Community Input
The Downtown Master Plan process involved a collaboration between the consultant, Le Sueur’s City Council, City Staff, stakeholder 
groups, and the general public, over approximately eight months.  
Public Meetings
Community meetings were held on June 8th, August 10th, and September 21st, 2017. The first meeting was attended by over 40 
people, 25 of whom submitted responses to a questionnaire regarding their use of downtown, their investment preferences, and 
potential mall redevelopment scenarios, with additional responses and feedback gathered online. 
After hearing from meeting attendees and building their understanding of the background information, Hoisington Koegler Group, 
Inc. prepared conceptual approaches to redeveloping Valley Green Square Mall, and held a second public meeting to review the 
feedback from the first open house, evaluate initial concepts for the mall site, and consider strategies for downtown revitalization. 
Approximately 35 people attended the meeting, and an additional 277 responded to an online questionnaire about the concepts.
The third community meeting attracted roughly 40 participants, who reviewed feedback from the second open house and online 
questionnaire, and discussed recommendations for land use and development character, transportation, signage, parks, trails, 
gathering areas, and downtown reinvestment initiatives.
Stakeholder Meetings
Meetings with stakeholders occurred over the course of the project. Groups involved in these meetings included mall owners, 
downtown business owners, Le Sueur County transportation department employees, and the Minnesota Department of Natural 
Resources (MnDNR), among others.

City Council Updates
City Council was updated four times throughout the Downtown Master Planning process, between July and December of 2017. The 
final Plan was approved by the Le Sueur City Council on December 11th, 2017.
Online Questionnaires
Two online questionnaires were distributed in order to understand what brings people to downtown and what residents feel would 
improve the area, and to collect feedback on various redevelopment scenarios for Valley Green Square Mall and overall strategies for 
downtown revitalization. The first questionnaire attracted 182 respondents, and the second attracted 277.
Public Input Themes
Comments reiterated throughout the engagement process helped to paint a picture of the biggest priorities for the community. 
Participants felt the need for a more vibrant downtown in which people will want to live, visit, and spend money. To achieve 
this goal, people expressed the need for updates and improvements to downtown properties and roads/streetscapes. They 
acknowledged that truck traffic has negative impacts on the quality of roads and the visitor experience in and around downtown 
Le Sueur.  They believe the community needs to be better connected to downtown, both physically- at Main Street- and culturally, 
through new and improved gathering spaces and activities for all age groups. People also requested more diverse food options from 
grocery stores to dining spots. Finally, residents want downtown Le Sueur to be unique, and to offer something that adjacent towns 
don’t already have. 
Project Area 
The City’s adjacency with U.S. Highway 169 provides 
an easy route for residents looking to travel to 
Mankato, the Twin Cities, and the Interstate Highway 
System. Downtown Le Sueur contains a gridded 
road and block pattern that is oriented to match the 
angle of the two original transportation corridors: the 
railroad and the Minnesota River. Generally, the blocks 
that conform to the traditional development pattern 
contain dimensions of 320’ wide by 400’ long with a 
central alley running lengthwise.

Le  S u e u r  D o w n t o w n  M a s t e r  P l a n
Issues/ Opportunities
Issues
Circulation Patterns
The circulation through downtown is disjointed due to the closure of Main Street between Bridge Street and Ferry Street. The 
railroad creates a barrier to the Minnesota River that can only be crossed in two locations (at Bridge Street/ Highway 93 and at 
Grove Street). The presence of significant heavy truck traffic and the frequent unloading of trucks also makes downtown difficult to 
navigate. These factors make it more unlikely that patrons of Radermacher’s or other businesses north of Bridge Street would visit 
businesses to the south, on Main Street.
Aesthetics
The mall and some of the other larger box buildings are not very attractive and take away from the character of the downtown. 
A number of buildings downtown have long concrete walls and lack windows, which creates an uncomfortable pedestrian 
environment.
Market
There are challenging realities to the current market for commercial property in downtown. High vacancy rates in the Mall are not 
as prevalent in other buildings, but the market does not have sufficient demand to quickly refill spaces that are vacated, nor does it 
have the rents to merit significant reinvestment. Additional discussion regarding market potential can be found on page 10.
Opportunities and Assets
Downtown 
The downtown blocks next to and across from the mall retain the classic small town feel. They include older buildings that bring 
character to the street, and with some reinvestment, the area could begin to shine. 
Jobs Base
The strong base of employment in Le Sueur is an asset, if the City can capitalize by keeping workers in Le Sueur to live, eat, and shop.
Parks & Trails
There are numerous parks that knit together a fabric of public spaces in the downtown. These parks can serve as key gathering 
places and help to shape the identity of the community. River Park and the planned riverfront park at the yard waste dump site 
would improve access and connections to the Minnesota River.
Parks and Trails present an opportunity to create character 
and identity through public spaces.

Identifying Reinvestment and Redevelopment Opportunities
The biggest opportunity for redevelopment in Downtown Le Sueur is the Valley Green Square Mall site. By redeveloping the mall 
and re-opening Main Street, the vitality and viability of South Main would markedly increase, the public realm could be improved, 
and development could be better tailored to the needs of tenants and create opportunities for new, more visible leasable space.
Other sites identified in the “Downtown Core” include:
»
» Underutilized parking lot on the northwest corner of Bridge Street and 2nd Street
»
» Open space between First Farmers and Merchants Bank and The Bar and Grill.
»
» The Le Sueur Theater

Existing Land Uses
There are three main districts in the downtown area. These areas are generalized and may have characteristics of other districts 
included along with their primary character. 
The “Downtown Core” is the first area encountered after crossing the Minnesota River. It contains the mall, as well as two blocks 
that have a more traditional, small town downtown character. Buildings in this district have a variety of heights and uses, and are 
most commonly set directly along the sidewalk. Historic buildings such as the Mayo House, and parks such as Fountain Park and 
Mother Louise Park, create a more urban feeling. This district also incorporates civic destinations such as City Hall, the Police Station, 
and the Library. 
The “Main Street Corridor” retains more of an orientation to auto traffic, with dedicated parking lots, larger setbacks, and more 
driveways. Many of the uses are geared toward automobile uses such as gas stations, auto shops, and banks with drive thrus.
The “North Industrial” area is a jobs center that accommodates a significant amount of truck traffic and loading, and contains many 
larger industrial buildings.

Currently,  two state highways provide access to Le Sueur from U.S. Highway 169: MN-
93 from the west and MN-112 from the north.
County Highways and County Turnback
In the near future, several roads through downtown will change jurisdictions. The 
Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) will turnback Highway 112 to Le 
Sueur County, and the route is slated for a variety of improvements in 2020. 
Rail Lines
The Union Pacific Railroad operates a line, running along the west side of downtown 
Le Sueur, which separates the City’s developed areas from the Minnesota River. There 
are two road underpasses at Bridge Street and Grove Street, and an at-grade crossing 
at Division Street. The bridge over MN-93 is a narrow, low-clearance bridge. This has 
created issues for circulation in Le Sueur:
»
» The bridge has been struck by trucks, in spite of the over height sensor and 
warning signal. As of November 2017, Union Pacific is working to raise the 
clearance of the bridge by 14 inches, in an effort to reduce the number of 
incidents involving trucks passing under the rail line.
»
» The bridge elevation requires MN-93 to dip below the bridge, before climbing 
rapidly to meet the intersection grade for Main Street. Trucks headed into town 
cannot stop at Main Street because of the challenging grade, especially during 
winter conditions. Trucks currently carry a lot of momentum up Bridge Street, 
creating noise and safety issues.
»
» The bridge abutments are too narrow to permit the installation of trails, sidewalks, 
or bike lanes along Bridge Street, extending to the river from downtown
Mall Circulation
The mall breaks up the city grid by eliminating Main Street for one block between 
Bridge Street and Ferry Street. As a result, most vehicular traffic goes around the mall 
using 2nd Street, one block to the east. Alternately, some people use the parking lot 
behind the First Farmers and First Merchants Bank, although this is not a public right-
of-way.
Truck Traffic
Truck traffic is needed to support the industrial and commercial uses all along 
Main Street, but there are issues that affect the city and create unsafe or nuisance 
conditions:
»
» Heavy truck traffic, truck movements, and loading along Main St. at Le Sueur 
Cheese Company, UFC and Davisco Foods 
»
» Trucks moving at high speeds while traveling up the hill on Bridge Street to 4th 
Street
»
» High traffic on Ferry Street that impacts schools and neighborhoods
»
» Vehicles not slowing down quickly enough when entering town along Highway 36 
(south) and Highway 26 (near High School)
Truck traffic on North Main Street
Railroad Bridge over MN-93
Main Street dead-ends at the Mall, just to 
the south of Bridge Street

Market Summary
The project team conducted an analysis of demographics and key market data in Le Sueur and the surrounding area to provide a 
summary of the economic and market forces that may influence the evolution of Downtown Le Sueur in the future. 
Demographic Overview / Projections
The economic conditions and prospects for any Downtown area are influenced by two key demographic groups:
»
» The number of people living within a particular range of driving (in terms of drive times), and the purchasing power of these 
potential customers
»
» The number of people who travel near or by a Downtown, and their purchasing power
The following map and tables depict some of the key demographic data for people located within a 5 minute, 15 minute, or 25 
minute drive of Downtown Le Sueur. The data was obtained from ESRI, a national research company that provides forecasts of 
demographic and economic information, based upon existing US Census data and local and regional economic trends. The tables 
reveal the following key takeaways:
»
» The area within a five minute drive of Downtown (mainly within the City of Le Sueur) is projected to remain relatively flat in terms 
of population and income growth, or to grow very slowly, over the next several years.
»
» The areas closer to Downtown Le Sueur also have an older population base, compared to outlying areas.
»
» The areas farther from Downtown Le Sueur (15 to 25 minutes away by vehicle) should experience noticeable growth in 
population over the next several years.
»
» While the City of Le Sueur may grow slowly in the future, the community should consider strategies to attract people living a 
bit farther away (in St Peter, Henderson, surrounding portions of Le Sueur and Sibley counties, and the Mankato area), to live, 
work, or shop in Downtown Le Sueur. This strategy would involve making Downtown Le Sueur a more attractive district and 
destination, over time.
»
» Importantly, the demographic data 
provided in the following tables depict 
the current economic position of Le 
Sueur, and the projections for the 
community assume that the public 
and private sector will not undertake 
any significant efforts to change the 
marketability of Le Sueur over the 
next few years. Efforts to change the 
perception of Downtown and the rest 
of Le Sueur in the minds of residents 
of the broader region could result 
in an increase in population and an 
improvement of economic data for Le 
Sueur over the next several years.

While Le Sueur and Sibley counties are expected to remain in a slower growth mode over the next several years, the Mankato metro 
area continues to grow and is expected to grow over the next several years. 
While Le Sueur is relatively close to the southwestern reaches of the Twin Cities, more of the economic relationships for Le Sueur (in 
terms of commuting and shopping patterns) have been with St. Peter and Mankato. The projected growth of the Mankato metro 
area presents an opportunity for Downtown Le Sueur to emerge as a “satellite” downtown for the metro area and attract visitors and 
residents from the Mankato area.

Employment
Compared to similar and comparable downtown districts between the Twin Cities and southern Minnesota, downtown Le Sueur 
benefits from the presence of a significant job base in the community.
 
A key strategy for Downtown Le Sueur may involve finding ways to gain business tied to the employment base, largely located on 
the northern end of Le Sueur, in terms of:
»
» Hospitality (potential hotel use)
»
» Food and beverage (including places to eat and drink, over lunch, or before or after work)
»
» Unique places and shops to visit before or after work, or to take visitors to local companies
»
» Residences in the Downtown area, for current or potential employees working in Le Sueur

Le  S u e u r  D o w n t o w n  M a s t e r  P l a n
Local Market Conditions and Implications
The following summarizes local market conditions in Le Sueur and the surrounding area.
Residential (Multi-Family): 
The City of Le Sueur has a relatively limited quantity of multi-family properties available for rent. A survey of available rentals on the 
market as of October 2017 indicates that one bedroom units typically rent in the $550 to $650 range (per month) and two bedroom 
units typically rent in the $650 to $750 range (per month). Data from CoStar, a database of real estate conditions for communities 
in the Twin Cities region, indicates that the average rental rate in Belle Plaine, the closest community to Le Sueur with CoStar data 
available, was around $0.91 per square foot, as of June 2017. The Belle Plaine market reported an overall multifamily vacancy rate of 
just 2 percent as of June 2017, and the average asking rate on a monthly basis was $605. 
The Mankato area, logically, has a much larger multi-family market, given its larger population and the presence of Minnesota State 
University within the community. The City of Mankato’s “Mankato Area Housing Study Update – 2016” indicated that estimated 
vacancy rates in the Mankato area remained very low, as of 2015. Due to the increase in population in the Mankato area over the last 
few years, the region added an estimated 1,570 to 1,670 units between 2010 and the end of 2016, for a total of 11,480 units at of the 
end of 2016. 
 
Source: City of Mankato, Mankato Area Housing Study Update – 2016
A survey of newer residential projects from the last year in the Mankato area indicates that units are renting from $1.10 per square 
foot (on a monthly basis) to nearly $1.50 per square foot (on a monthly basis) for luxury-oriented apartment complexes.
Overall, the Mankato area has reported a lack of supply of affordable housing for residents of various age groups, and the supply of 
available units remains fairly tight.
Takeaways, Multi-Family Market:
»
» The market for new multi-family development in Le Sueur remains unproven, in that the community has not attracted a newer 
multi-family development in recent years. Therefore, the potential viability of multi-family development remains untested in the 
local market.
»
» However, the lack of housing options in the Mankato region, coupled with the overall anticipated population growth in the 
greater Mankato area, will create demand for additional residential development in the area over the next five to ten years.
»
» Discussions with local developers indicate that residential may represent a viable land use in the Downtown Le Sueur area, given 
the proximity of Le Sueur (via US 169) to the Mankato area and to the southern reaches of the Twin Cities metro area.
»
» Potential residential development in the Downtown area could include traditional market-rate apartments, as well as units 
geared and marketed to the senior housing market (of individuals age 55 or older).

Office:
The Downtown Le Sueur area currently has a limited amount of office space, primarily geared to small business owners, and 
professional services operations (including two medical office users on the second floor of the Valley Green Square Mall). Most of 
the space in Downtown Le Sueur is relatively old in age and therefore supports a lower rent level, compared to newer space in other 
communities including Saint Peter and Mankato. There were a few vacancies for office along Main Street, to the north of the mall, as 
of October 2017. 
In the broader Mankato area, the growth in the economy has supported additional office development, including the first office 
tower built in Downtown Mankato since 1983 (the 50,000 square foot Ridley Tower, developed by The Tailwind Group). The Saint 
Peter area has seen relatively limited office development over the last several years, given the smaller size of the community. 
Average rents for office space in the Mankato area have ranged from $13 to $16 per square foot over the last few years, based upon 
discussions with local brokers.
Takeaways, Office Market:
»
» The quantity of office in Le Sueur is very limited, and Downtown Le Sueur is not recognized as a significant location for offices, 
either locally or regionally.
»
» The current office inventory in Le Sueur is older and therefore rents for lower rates than newer office space in other nearby 
communities.
»
» Any additional office space in Downtown Le Sueur would likely be marketed to professional or medical office tenants (attorneys, 
dentists and doctors, etc.), or to local companies requiring extra office space for expansions.
»
» The market for office space in Downtown Le Sueur remains unproven, as the community has not witnessed additional office 
growth in quite some time. However, office space could potentially attract interest in Downtown, given the significant base 
of employment in the community, and the potential need for additional office space associated with companies that have 
operations in the area.
16
Le  S u e u r  D o w n t o w n  M a s t e r  P l a n
Retail:
The Downtown Le Sueur area features a number of vacancies in the Valley Green Square Mall building, including a former grocery 
store space, a former restaurant space (on the north end of the mall) and additional smaller spaces in the mall’s interior. Overall, 
the mall is currently over 50 percent vacant. However, outside of the mall, nearly all of the retail spaces along the streets in 
Downtown are full, and City officials often have difficulty in locating spaces that could work for potential new businesses exploring 
the Downtown area for a potential location. The lease rates in the Downtown area are generally much lower than those in the 
surrounding communities. 
Whereas the average rents in the Mankato market generally fall in the $12 to $16 per square foot range, rents in Downtown Le Sueur 
are believed to generally fall below $10 per foot.
Broader Trends:
»
» The increase in online sales continues to create uncertainty in the retail world, particularly for larger format retailers (“box” stores 
such as Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, etc.) and traditional department stores (Macy’s, Kohl’s, etc.). 
»
» Retailers located in attractive and desirable “downtown” areas, however, are benefiting from the popularity of the experience 
of shopping and spending time in these types of districts. The future of retail is focusing on providing unique goods and 
experiences that consumers cannot find online.
Takeaways, Retail Market:
»
» Retail in Downtown Le Sueur, according to real estate brokers and developers, essentially provides day to day goods and services 
(including items that can be purchased at the hardware store and the pharmacy), and does not significantly attract outside 
business from the surrounding communities, the Mankato area, or the southern reaches of the Twin Cities region. 
»
» The downtowns in Saint Peter and Henderson attract greater levels of visitation from other communities, compared to Le Sueur.
»
» Expanding retail in Downtown Le Sueur would require attracting the types of tenants, and goods and services, that would entice 
residents and visitors to travel to Downtown Le Sueur on a more regular basis. The community may wish, for example, to identify 
and work to attract various “destination” uses to locate in Downtown Le Sueur.
Potential “Destination” Uses to Consider
Small town downtowns around the country have attracted a range of “destination” tenants or uses that help drive traffic to their 
downtowns. Many of these kinds of destinations start as mom-and-pop or small business ventures. Downtown Le Sueur may have 
the potential to market its central location off US 169 to attract some of the following types of users:
»
» Brewery
»
» Distillery
»
» Country themed restaurant
»
» Winery or wine bar
»
» Artisan shop
Key Takeaways Overall
While the local market remains unproven in terms of the potential for office, retail, and residential development in Downtown Le 
Sueur, given the overall growth of the Mankato area and the presence of the US 169 corridor, the community has the potential to 
generate additional demand for various kinds of land uses in the downtown district over time, given it follows a cohesive strategy 
to enhance the attractiveness and marketability of the district. Based upon the examples of success in other smaller Minnesota 
downtowns (in Henderson, Cannon Falls, and elsewhere) Downtown Le Sueur must build a base of amenities that appeals not 
only to local Le Sueur residents, but also to residents and visitors from the broader area stretching from the Twin Cities to Mankato. 
The city and the community must introduce amenities and uses (such as trails, great public spaces, good parks, and attractive 
streetscapes) that generate more interest in visiting Downtown Le Sueur. Strategies to create these amenities must combine with 
determined efforts to attract and nurture the kinds of tenants in Downtown that will attract more out-of-towners (such as unique 
shops, good restaurants, and other tenants that would make Downtown Le Sueur unique). While the broader region will continue to 
grow, Downtown Le Sueur will have to fundamentally shift its orientation and its message to the region to establish the district as a 
unique and sought-after small town district that deserves repeated visits.

DOWNTOWN MASTER PLAN
D o w n t o w n  M a s t e r  P l a n
Approach to the Master Plan and Redevelopment
This master plan approaches improvements to downtown using five elements. 
1.	Downtown Districts, Land Use, and Redevelopment Scenarios:
The plan draws distinctions between different areas of downtown and works to ensure 
that their land uses make sense, given potential redevelopment opportunities. This section 
addresses potential redevelopment or reuse options for the Valley Green Square Mall site.
2.	Downtown Development Character Initiatives
This section outlines commercial, residential, and employment initiatives that will help to 
achieve a development character that is compatible with each district and the intended overall 
vision for downtown. 
3.	Transportation and Wayfinding
The plan considers the implications of transportation on redevelopment, and provides 
initiatives to improve streets, parking, signage, and gateways into downtown. These strengthen 
wayfinding and organize travel within downtown, and improve broader connections to it.
4.	Parks, Trails, and Open Space
This section explores ways to tie Le Sueur to its riverfront amenities, connect downtown to a 
regional trail network, and create flexible spaces for markets and community events, with the 
goal of creating a healthy, vibrant downtown.
5.	Community Reinvestment Strategies
Finally, the Downtown Master Plan looks to facilitate redevelopment through community 
reinvestment strategies. These recommended actions, policies, and procedures will guide 
downtown business development and help to create a destination that sustains businesses 
and celebrates local heritage.

Le  S u e u r  D o w n t o w n  M a s t e r  P l a n
Redevelopment Approach Diagram
Most potential redevelopment is focused around Valley Green Square Mall in the downtown core. Here, several factors 
come together to provide a transformative opportunity. City-owned property along 2nd Street, coupled with the State 
Highway 112 turnback to Le Sueur County, has the power to generate revenue for the City if sold for development. The 
County turnback and the Valley Green Square Mall redevelopment make a reconnected Main Street possible, including 
streetscape improvements that can improve safety and aesthetics in downtown. The proximity of these projects means 
that as development occurs, the visual transformation of the area will be quite impactful, potentially catalyzing additional 
opportunities for redevelopment at other identified sites. 
Past approaches to redevelopment, such as that envisioned by the 2007 Minnesota Design Team, emphasized redevelopment 
along the railroad tracks south of Bridge Street. While that possibility should be explored, especially in the long-term as 
downtown becomes more popular, those parcels are difficult to develop under current conditions. Access is prohibited from 
Bridge Street, and frequent train traffic makes the land less than desirable for most uses. If, in the future, the area becomes 
more marketable, redevelopment could take advantage of the proximity to the river by selectively clearing some of the tree 
canopy to highlight views of the river valley that are limited right now due to dense growth.

1. Downtown Districts, Land Use, and Redevelopment Scenarios
Downtown Districts
The Downtown Master Plan focuses on three distinct districts, shown in the map below. The first is the “North Industrial” district, 
north of Grove Street, between the railroad tracks and 4th Street. Notable businesses include Agropur, which operates the Le Sueur 
Cheese Company and Davisco Foods. The second district is the Main Street Corridor, which includes the blocks adjacent to Main 
Street from Grove Street to just south of Oak. A mix of commercial and residential uses exist in this area. The third district is the 
Downtown Core, which encompasses the blocks on either side of Main Street from Swan Street to Smith, and includes Valley Green 
Square Mall, the Public Library, City Hall, the majority of downtown’s commercial space, and the largest collection of historical Main 
Street buildings.
The downtown core is the only district proposed to include changes to the City’s land use plan. These changes center around the 
Valley Green Square Mall site, which would transition from commercial to mixed use, in order to allow for flexibility in development 
options, with either a vertical or horizontal mix of uses.

Le  S u e u r  D o w n t o w n  M a s t e r  P l a n
Downtown Character
The North Industrial District was identified in the Comprehensive Plan as an innovation district focus area; as such, the 
district’s character is intended to put forth the image of Le Sueur as a center of entrepreneurial energy that fosters innovation 
and collaboration. Opportunities to build upon the existing industrial and business park uses should be pursued, especially by 
incorporating flexible incubator spaces for start-up businesses, craft industries, shared work spaces, or artisan maker space. With easy 
access off of Hwy 169, nearby neighborhoods, opportunities for recreational access, and added jobs, the North Industrial District will 
be well-positioned to attract workers and new residents. 
The Main Street Corridor has a mix of uses lining the street, which results in an inconsistent street frontage. Streetscape 
improvements would visually tie the Main Street Corridor to the Downtown Core. Street trees, banners identifying Le Sueur and 
promoting events, matching site furnishings, and pedestrian-friendly paving will provide a welcoming visual appeal to the corridor.
The Downtown Core, Le Sueur’s primary commercial district, is home to most of downtown Le Sueur’s remaining historical 
buildings. Reconnecting Main Street through the Valley Green Square Mall property (a priority of the community) will help to restore 
some of the traditional charm of historical Main Street, in addition to promoting better access to downtown businesses. Infill and 
redevelopment opportunities should be explored, especially where there are gaps in the street frontage. Historical buildings, like the 
theatre, should be preserved and restored where possible. Incorporating vertical and horizontal mixed use buildings downtown will 
help to diversify housing options within Le Sueur, and lead to a more ideal balance of land uses given the market.
The planning effort for the Valley Green Square Mall property, as well as the City-owned parking lot directly to the east of the mall 
structure, considered a variety of options, ranging from the partial reconstruction of portions of the mall building, to the removal of 
the entire mall structure and construction of new space on the mall site. 
Redevelopment Focus Area: Valley Green Square Mall
The following development considerations frame the scenarios outlined on the following pages for the Valley Green Square Mall.
1.	Construction of new space is much more expensive than the cost of refurbishing existing office or retail space, on average, and 
as a result, options or scenarios that include a good deal of newly constructed space (retail, residential, or office)  face greater 
challenges in terms of financial viability.
2.	Downtown parking lots to the east of the mall site, and across the street, on the northwest corner of 2nd and Bridge Streets, 
provide easier development opportunities because the land is already owned by the City. In theory, the City could solicit interest 
in developing residential, office, or retail space on the parking lots to catalyze reinvestment in Downtown Le Sueur. A developer 
could obtain the land from the City at a very low cost (or even free) in order to make a particular project more viable.
3.	Developing residential units on portions of the site would add residents to the Downtown area who will contribute to the vitality 
of Downtown. Over time, additional housing Downtown will transform peoples’  image of Downtown Le Sueur into that of a 
district geared towards living, in addition to shopping and working.
4.	The scenarios that include more residential uses also generate better financial results, compared to options that include a greater 
amount of retail and office land uses. However, all of the project elements outlined in the various scenarios would require some 
form of gap financing (in the form of tax incentives or other tools, as discussed in the Implementation section) in order to make a 
particular scenario viable in the local marketplace.
5.	The phasing of development helps to reduce the overall risk of particular scenarios and allows the City and development 
partners to take on smaller portions of the overall effort to reposition the block containing the mall. The project can move along 
at a slower pace, if necessary, based on the local market and the overall economy.
6.	All three scenarios call for the re-opening of Main Street between Bridge Street and Ferry Street and the construction of an 
attractive streetscape along Main Street on this block, to enhance the marketability of this key entry into Downtown Le Sueur.

Redevelopment Scenarios
Valley Green Square Mall sits adjacent to a 1970s era pedestrian mall that cuts off vehicular access along Main Street between Bridge 
Street and Ferry Street. One of the main priorities of this plan involves reopening Main Street to vehicular traffic, which will provide 
better access to local businesses. Redevelopment at the Valley Green Square Mall site is key to achieving this goal. The following 
graphics illustrate three potential scenarios for redevelopment, with Scenario A identified as the preferred option.

Scenario A: Partial Mall Redevelopment + Infill Residential
 Phase 1:  Sell off parcels of land on the north and south corners of 
the mall parking lot, and build new residential apartment 
buildings to help stimulate initial downtown redevelopment. 
Reconfigure the remaining mall parking lot to maximize 
parking. A City-owned parcel north of Bridge Street and 
west of 2nd Street could also be sold and developed as 
townhomes.

between the parking lot and Main Street.
Scenario A: Financial Analysis
Scenario A produces the best overall financial viability of the three Scenarios 
outlined in this report. This Scenario assumes that the majority of the existing 
space in the mall structure would be retained and renovated, as opposed to 
demolished and replaced with new structures. The focus on residential land uses, 
as well as the focus on the more inexpensive cost of renovating existing mall 
space, produces a more favorable financial result.

Scenario C: Full Redevelopment of Valley Green Square Mall
 Phasing:   Scenario C requires the entire mall site to be sold for 
redevelopment that could occur all at once, or in phases, 
based on the developer’s preference. This concept adds new 
office/retail uses on the northeast and southeast corners of 
the parking lot. Existing mall tenants could relocate to these 
buildings if they were part of an initial phase. A reconnected 
Main Street for vehicles also includes pedestrian realm 
improvements and a flexible design that can transform 
into a festival street for events. Two, three-story mixed use 
buildings replace the mall and provide housing and retail 
space, with underground parking. Between the new mixed-
use buildings, a downtown plaza space introduces a new 
place for community gathering. Across Main Street, the open 
lot next to the bank provides an opportunity for additional 
retail infill, where an existing mall tenant could relocate.
Downtown Plaza
• Connects parking to Main Street
• Creates a gathering place downtown
• Expands space available for festivals 
or events
• Includes overhead lighting, 
plantings, public art
• Possibility of including fountain jets 
for water play
Pedestrian Realm Improvements
• Trees, benches, planters, and cafe space 
enhance the public realm
• Pavement treatments at crosswalks, 
corners, and along Main Street between 
Bridge Street and Ferry Street
• Some streetscape elements continue 
north and south along Main Street 
between Swan and Smith
• Main Street can transform into a Festival 
Street to accommodate events
Corner Office/Retail
• If part of an initial 
phase, existing mall 
tenants could be 
relocated here (at least 
temporarily)
NOTE:
Although not shown In this graphic, the 
build out of Scenario C could involve the 
development of approximately 32 apartments 
on the north and south ends of the City-owned 
parking lot (behind the current mall), instead 
of the development of office and retail uses, as 
shown. It could also involve the development 
of a 6-unit townhome project on the northwest 
corner of 2nd Street and Bridge Street. This 
alternative version of Scenario C, however, 
would not result in a significantly different 
degree of financial viability, compared to the 
option shown on this page.

Summary of Financial Analyses: Scenarios 
for the Valley Green Square Mall
The various scenarios for the Valley Green Square Mall property (including the 
City-owned parking lots along 2nd Street) were evaluated from a financial viability 
perspective, using a series of assumptions concerning project costs and anticipated 
revenues. The financial analyses did not represent a detailed examination of 
the financial viability of the various scenarios, in terms of the particular financial 
implications for a developer, the city, or the current owners of the mall property. 
Instead, the analyses provided a fairly high-level examination of the overall financial 
profitability of the scenarios, as depicted on the preceding pages. 
The financial analyses incorporated assumptions concerning the lease rates and 
financial returns for retail, office, and residential components of the various scenarios, 
drawing from data gathered from the Mankato, Le Sueur, and Belle Plaine areas, 
coupled with information gathered from discussions with developers in the Mankato 
area. The analyses incorporated standard assumptions for building costs and for soft 
costs (including items such as legal and design services and other non-construction 
expenditures), based upon local data and discussions with local developers. The 
financial analyses, importantly, did incorporate the costs of completing the Main 
Street streetscape, next to the mall, as well as the costs for new parking spaces 
associated with the different scenarios. They also assumed that the overall project cost 
would include the repayment of existing mortgages tied to the mall property.
The table below outlines the overall, estimated project cost of each scenario, as well 
as a preliminary estimate of the Net Present Value (NPV) for each scenario. The term 
“Net Present Value” refers to the difference between the present value of cash inflows 
and the present value of cash outflows, for any given project. The term “present value” 
means that the analysis considers all money coming in, or going out, associated with 
a project, in terms of the value of these cash flows in today’s dollars. The calculation of 
“present value” allows for an analysis to take out the long term effects of inflation, in 
examining financial viability. In theory, from a financial planning perspective, a project 
with a positive NPV would be worth further investigating and pursuing. The term “Net 
Present Value” is not the same as “Net Profit”, but it does provide an overall snapshot of 
the financial viability of a given scenario.
As outlined in the chart below, all of the scenarios for the mall site (and the city’s 
parking lot) produce a negative NPV. However, the differences between the different 
NPV’s are significant. Scenario A produces the overall, most favorable financial return 
of the three scenarios, given the overall lower project cost (in terms of construction 
costs, primarily). 
Scenario
Overall Project Cost
Net Present Value
Scenario A
Approximately $10 Million
Approximately -$1.2 Million
Scenario B
Approximately $11 Million
Approximately -$2.5 Million
Scenario C
Approximately $20 Million
Approximately -$7 Million
 
31
The project costs for each scenario include the costs of constructing Main Street, from 
Bridge Street to Ferry Street, as well as the costs of streetscape improvements along 
this block (such as trees, seating areas, public art, etc.). The County could potentially 
pay for part of the cost of constructing Main Street, and the City could potentially 
attract grants or other funding for the streetscape portion of the project. The cost of 
the Main Street improvements, including streetscape, are in the range of $600,000 to 
$700,000. Therefore, assuming that the County or other governments would be able 
to fund at least a portion of the Main Street improvements the NPVs for each scenario 
would improve. If for example, local or state governments could pay for the cost of 
the Main Street improvements, the overall Net Present Value for Scenario A could 
improve to -$500,000 (from -$1.2 million).
Importantly, the financial analyses do not include any assumptions regarding financial 
incentives or assistance that may be provided by the City of Le Sueur or other 
government entities. Tax incentives, coupled with other financial support provided to 
complete project components such as the Main Street improvements, for example, 
could bridge the NPV “gap” of $1.2 million for Scenario A.
Overall, the financial analysis demonstrates that the scenarios that call for the partial 
reuse of the mall structure would produce more favorable financial results, given that 
these scenarios would not involve the construction of significant areas of new space 
for retail or office uses. It illustrates that Scenario C (the full reconstruction of the mall 
property into new Main Street-oriented buildings) may represent a longer-term vision 
for Downtown Le Sueur. For example, a property owner or developer could complete 
the façade and building renovations outlined in Scenario A, and then pursue a more 
full-scaled reconstruction of the mall property (Scenario C) ten to twenty years down 
the line.
While the financial analyses represent high level, initial reviews of potential financial 
returns, they do suggest that the City should work initially to reopen and improve 
Main Street by the mall, coupled with efforts to develop residential uses on the 
backside of the mall. The majority of the existing mall structure could be renovated 
and improved sufficiently to attract business for the near term, and over time, as 
Downtown gains strength and marketability, the property owner can consider more 
significant rebuilding of the mall structure along Main Street.

3. Transportation and Wayfinding
Broader Community Connections & Gateways
The main access points into downtown Le Sueur are from U.S. Highway 169 to the 
north or west, via either State Highway 112 or State Highway 93. Large-scale gateway 
signs on Highway 169 would better announce Downtown Le Sueur to travelers. From 
the east, County Road 26 (Lexington Road), and from the south, County Road 36 and 
State Highway 112, provide access into downtown. Gateway signage at these regional 
entry points will provide additional definition and awareness of Le Sueur. Other 
gateway signage is envisioned at the railroad overpass on Highway 93, as this serves 
as a physical entryway into downtown after crossing the Minnesota River. A smaller, 
recreation-based gateway for trail users is proposed once the state trail along the 
Minnesota River is constructed through Le Sueur. This will ensure that trail users have 
a clear place to stop and explore the town, taking advantage of Le Sueur’s amenities. 
This gateway could also serve as an entryway to the Minnesota River valley for Le 
Sueur residents. 
Truck Bypass
Given Le Sueur’s industrial and agricultural economy, truck traffic has a significant 
presence in downtown. These large vehicles have major impacts on roads, contribute 
noise and pollution, and detract from the overall visitor experience. With the pending 
County and City turnbacks (illustrated on the graphic on page 34), efforts to reduce 
truck traffic will have major benefits on the maintenance needs for roads through 
downtown, in addition to improving the general atmosphere of the area. For these 
reasons, a truck bypass is proposed. The map on the next page illustrates short-term 
and long-term alignment options. Short-term, trucks entering Le Sueur on Highway 
112 from Highway 169 can turn on Dakota Street (CR 35) and follow this road south 
and then take a right on CR 26. Trucks would then follow Highway 112 south out 
of Le Sueur. Long-term, an alignment between CR 35 and CR 115 remains to be 
determined.

Planned Road Jurisdictional Changes
In the near future, several roads through downtown are changing jurisdictional hands. The map below shows these planned 
changes. The most significant is that the State will turnback Highway 112 to Le Sueur County, and the route is slated for 
improvement in 2020. 
Downtown Truck Traffic
Truck traffic that cannot use the truck bypass route can travel through downtown in a limited fashion. Access to Main Street going 
south will be restricted from State Highway 93, as this turning movement will not likely meet safety standards due to significant 
grades and limited sightlines. Trucks travelling south from State Highway 93 can follow the County Turnback to Ferry Street, traveling 
around the Valley Green Square Mall site. Trucks already on Main Street can continue to travel north or south past the mall site once 
Main Street is reopened to vehicular traffic.

Proposed Pedestrian and Bicycle Connections
Non-motorized Connections
Improved connections for pedestrians and bicyclists will enable safe, comfortable travel between downtown, nearby 
neighborhoods, schools, recreational amenities, and other destinations. Streets identified as connectors should include sidewalks 
and on-street bike lanes or bike boulevard signage (sharrows). Safety improvements such as curb extensions, painted crosswalks, 
signalized crossings, and flashers should be evaluated at key intersections.

Main Street Reconnection: Road Sections
The sections shown here illustrate how Main Street might look if the western edge of the existing mall is torn down to make way 
for a reconnected street, and the remaining mall is redeveloped with improved interiors and an updated facade (as in Scenario A). 
Ample right-of-way (ROW) allows for a pleasant pedestrian realm flexible enough to accommodate tents for a market or other event 
uses. The ultimate design of the street section will be coordinated with Le Sueur County.

4. Parks, Trails, and Open Space
Parks
With the future addition of a State Trail along the river, visitors from as far as Shakopee, Mankato, and New Ulm will have access to 
Le Sueur’s section of the Minnesota River Valley. Le Sueur has an opportunity to repurpose the riverside yard storage space into a 
low-impact park that would allow visitors to explore this unique landscape. A network of trails and the addition of shelters would 
encourage hiking, picnicking and passive recreation, while respecting the river bottom landscape. 
Downtown Le Sueur has two existing parks along Main Street: Mother Louise Park and Fountain Park. With the addition of picnic 
tables, Mother Louise Park could function as a quaint lunch spot for workers downtown, or for visitors to the historic Mayo House. 
Fountain Park could also provide a place for respite, but the concrete around the park is breaking down, and the fountain no longer 
functions. Given the busy nature of adjacent streets, repairing the fountain would mediate street noise and make the space more 
pleasant. The park is well-positioned to include iconic gateway signage or public art that promotes civic pride. Other proposed 
improvements are detailed in the Fountain Park Concept Master Plan, prepared in 2016. Investing in downtown parks is vital to a well-
rounded Main Street.
Trails
Given its location along the Minnesota River, Le Sueur is well-positioned to take advantage of a wealth of outdoor recreation 
opportunities. In the future, it will lie at the junction of the Minnesota Valley and Minnesota River State trails. Making Le Sueur an 
appealing destination for trail users will be key to attracting trail-based tourism. Constructing a trailhead would aid in this endeavor. 
In order to strengthen downtown’s link to the river, improved connections along Grove Street and Bridge Street are proposed, 
including on-street connections such as bike lanes, sharrows, and sidewalks and visual connections through the addition of gateways 
and wayfinding signage. Engineered trail connections under the railroad in these locations will be necessary to achieve this goal.

This master plan provides a guide for upgrades and repairs to Le Sueur’s Downtown Fountain Park. This park is the “front door” to the city 
for people coming into town from the west. At the lower end of the park, the focus is more of a welcome experience with an emphasis 
on natural features and character, building off
  the entry drive through the fl
 oodplain forest and the river. Coming up the hill and into 
downtown, the character of the park becomes more formal, echoing the small town, historic spirit of Le Sueur’s downtown. Elements of 
both preliminary concepts were incorporated into this fi
 nal concept.
Priority “A” items should be addressed as soon as possible, priority “B” items should be addressed as resources and donations become available.
Prices refl
 ect a planning level cost analysis based on commercial install prices. Prices may vary based on changes to material and labor costs. 
Potential savings may be realized through donations and self performing installation work. Concept and features subject to change based on 
costs, donations, and preferences.

Open Spaces and Gathering Areas
In places where people live, work, and shop, neighbors and friends often run into 
each other and have reason to stop and chat. These impromptu gatherings contribute 
to the vitality of small town Main Streets. Offering flexible spaces that facilitate these 
interactions makes for a friendlier environment. Site furnishings and streetscape 
amenities like benches, seatwalls, planters, and lighting encourage visitors to spend 
time downtown. Where possible, public art or other playful features like fountain jets 
should be incorporated to activate space and promote social interaction.
To allow for gatherings on a grander scale, the streetscape and pedestrian realm 
along Main Street should be designed to transform into festival and market space. 
Reconnecting Main Street and redeveloping the Valley Green Square Mall site 
provides a perfect opportunity to incorporate flexible urban spaces to accommodate 
many types of programming. Depending on the size and timing of the event, tents 
and tables could either be set up on the sidewalk, leaving the street and parking 
open; vendors could use parking spaces for their tents, maximizing sidewalk space 
for event-goers and leaving the road open to traffic. Alternately, the entire road could 
be closed down during the event and used as a festival street. Where redevelopment 
allows, plaza space and pedestrian connections should be integrated into the block, 
providing additional spaces for gathering.

Keys to Implementation
Several factors will be crucial in successfully realizing the vision set forth by the community and the City Council outlined 
in this downtown master plan. These factors apply regardless of the actual form and timing of redevelopment:
Patience & Commitment to Vision 
Commitment to the plan and patience go hand-in-hand.  This plan does more than simply seek to attract new 
development to shovel ready sites in Le Sueur; it provides a road map to move the area toward the realization of a 
vibrant downtown.  Commitment to the plan means the willingness to actively promote public and private investments 
that align with the objectives of the master plan.  It also requires the willingness by decision makers to discourage 
development which does not meet the objectives of the plan. Not all of these decisions will be easy, nor will they occur 
exactly as analyzed in this master plan.
Strategic Investments
If financial support for the plan was unlimited, the need for strategic decisions would be less important. With limited 
funds, every expenditure is crucial. It is not possible to immediately undertake all of the initiatives described in this plan. 
Needs and opportunities not contemplated in the plan may arise in the future.  Every investment must be evaluated for 
its ability to enhance downtown Le Sueur and the overall community.
Public & Private Partnerships
Removal of the physical and economic barriers to redevelopment in Le Sueur will require public financial assistance. The 
complexity of redevelopment envisioned for the area clearly demonstrates the need for some level of public financial 
participation. Private investment will not be sufficient to pay for all costs associated with every redevelopment project.  
Strong public/private partnerships will make redevelopment projects more financially feasible, promote the desired 
types of development and build momentum in the area. The needs established in this plan do not make public financial 
assistance an entitlement; on-going planning will define the nature of assistance and the amount available for each step 
throughout the implementation process.  This approach ensures that public monies are used to achieve desired public 
outcomes and do not simply make development more affordable (or profitable) for the developer.

Financial Planning
The ability to make strategic investments relies on the continued evolution of the preliminary financial planning found in this 
document.  Implementing the plan cannot be viewed as a series of independent projects but rather a series of interrelated actions.  
Certain public improvements serve a broader area and not a single project.  Revenues will come from multiple projects.  Some 
public investments will be required prior to private redevelopment. The ability to coordinate public actions with the revenues 
resulting from private development will be critical to the success of the plan. Failure to consider the implementation relationships 
between elements of the plan will lead to missed opportunities and increased risk for the City.
Roles & Responsibilities
Responsibility for implementing this plan will rest with many entities in the community that share a common vision for the future for 
Le Sueur.  A clear understanding of implementation roles and responsibilities promotes the effective use of limited resources. 
Although strategies for implementation may differ depending on the particular project or effort, the groups outlined below will 
logically work together, in a progressive manner, over time. The City of Le Sueur, along with the Comprehensive Plan Action Tem, 
Planning Commission, and the EDA, will likely help set big picture goals for Downtown’s progression in a given year or periodically. 
These groups can, together, work to identify specific projects or actions to be completed, in line with the Downtown Master 
Plan. However, support for and the impetus behind most of the Downtown initiatives should come from business owners and 
the community at large, including a potential Downtown Business Association. Once a project or initiative has support from the 
community and the business and property owners in the Downtown district, the City staff, along with the EDA, can work on 
formulating formal strategies to complete a given project or initiative. The Planning Commission and then the City Council would 
need to formally sign off on certain projects or initiatives involving Downtown. After formal approval, the City staff would continue 
(in most cases) to monitor the progress of particular projects or strategies, over time.
The formal stewardship of the Downtown Master Plan will be shared between the City of Le Sueur, the Economic Development 
Authority, and a potential Downtown Business Association. Official stewardship of particular projects will depend on the nature of 
the project. For example, the City would have stewardship over improvements to the public realm, whereas a Downtown Business 
Association could hold stewardship over elements that pertain more to programming (such as holding festivals or events in the 
downtown area). Above all, the implementation of the Downtown Master Plan will require that all of the entities outlined below 
work together and remain in consistent communication in order to efficiently implement the elements of this plan.
City of Le Sueur
The ultimate responsibility for implementing this downtown master plan rests with the City of Le Sueur.  The City Council will 
provide direction on staff resources, review of proposed development projects, and focus public investments. The management 
of the redevelopment effort will fall primarily to Departments of Administration and Economic Development, with additional 
assistance from the departments of Finance, and Planning and Zoning. The actions of the Economic Development and Planning and 
Zoning departments include: 
»
» Application of land use controls and redevelopment guidelines to shepherd private development;
»
» Review of development plans and proposals;
»
» Coordination of planning for capital improvements needed to facilitate redevelopment; and
»
» Creation of financial plans for public redevelopment investments and continued monitoring of the plans.
Comprehensive Plan Action Team (CPAT)
The Comprehensive Plan Action Team will ensure that plans proposed for the Downtown Le Sueur area align with the vision, guiding 
principles, and actions outlined in the City’s Comprehensive Plan. 
Planning Commission
The Planning Commission will review specific site plans from an entitlement perspective, before sending plans on to the City 
Council for approval. The Planning Commission will work with City staff to update development codes and policies to allow for 
proposed uses.
47
I m p l e m e n t a t i o n 
Economic Development Authority (EDA)
The study area is an important location for economic development and job creation in Le Sueur.  It is the EDA that will keep the 
momentum of development and redevelopment moving in the direction envisioned by the Downtown Master Plan and adopted by 
the City. The EDA and City Council will need to determine their specific roles for a coordinated effort. Several potential EDA actions 
make this group an important player in the successful implementation of the plan:
»
» Provide a framework for coordinating various community efforts focused on Downtown Le Sueur. With limited resources, it is 
essential that the community work in unison to undertake redevelopment. The knowledge and experience gained from the 
planning process allows EDA members to efficiently and effectively take steps needed to implement the plan.
»
» Work to ensure that economic development initiatives within Le Sueur are a recognized priority for City Council members.
»
» Maintain an active role.  Actively pursuing critical properties for redevelopment or educating business owners concerning 
potential improvement or reinvestment programs should represent continued and expanded roles for the EDA.
»
» Create an annual redevelopment/ reinvestment “action plan” to monitor progress toward implementation.  This action plan would 
outline key steps to occur during each year, including descriptions of actions, responsible parties and funding resources. This plan 
would force the parties not only to consider what needs to be done in the coming year, but also why identified steps were not 
taken in the prior year.
»
» Work with business owners and landlords to promote and help finance the maintenance and revitalization of downtown 
businesses and buildings in the downtown core. 
»
» Host annual developer roundtables or site tours showcasing the potential of Le Sueur sites to perspective developers.
»
» Recognize the individual assets of the downtown for economic development and steer the appropriate uses to Downtown.
»
» Lead the marketing efforts for available sites in the mall redevelopment area
»
» Provide guidance to the City to ensure that proposed development projects and public improvements are consistent with the 
Downtown Master Plan.
»
» Promote development projects that incorporate sustainable design practices.
»
» Continue to secure the appropriate funding options for various types of redevelopment projects.
»
» Collaborate with private brokers marketing Le Sueur sites and leverage marketing efforts.
Community-at-Large
The community of Le Sueur must stay involved as redevelopment continues over time. The community must work together with 
decision-makers and provide the necessary input for any new development, respecting the rights of existing land owners and 
satisfying the vision for Downtown Le Sueur.  Ultimately, the community must:
»
» Provide a singular focus for the plan. The knowledge gained from the planning process will allow members of the community to 
efficiently and effectively comment on redevelopment proposals.
»
» Continue public involvement. Continue to attend public meetings, provide comments and suggestions regarding proposals in 
Downtown Le Sueur as they come forward.

Land Use Controls
Implementation efforts will initially focus on actions needed to establish the downtown master plan as the official guide for 
development and redevelopment in Downtown Le Sueur. These procedural steps in implementation involve the adoption of key 
policy documents and updated development controls.
Approve the Master Plan
The first implementation step involves EDA and City Council actions to approve this master plan. These approvals set the stage for 
subsequent actions such as amending the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinances and capital improvement programs, and the 
allocation of financial resources.
Amend Land Use Controls
Plan approval is the trigger necessary to take other actions needed to guide land uses in the area in accordance with this Master 
Plan. Land use controls not only promote the desired development outcomes, but also prevent development that is not consistent 
with the plan.
Comprehensive Plan
The City will need to update the Comprehensive Plan with the components of the new “Downtown Master Plan,” including the land 
use plan designations and appropriate policies consistent with the vision of this master plan. Amending the Comprehensive Plan 
creates the foundation for all other implementation actions. Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan is a statutory requirement for 
zoning regulations, capital improvements and redevelopment projects.
Zoning Regulations
More direct control of development comes from zoning regulations.  Zoning changes are likely needed in order to implement the 
Downtown Master Plan. Detailed analysis and formal recommendations of any zoning changes will be handled by the City. Two 
approaches should be further explored. One approach is to modify the existing zoning to loosen key design standards. A second 
approach would involve rezoning the downtown area to a series of existing zoning classifications and then applying “overlay 
districts,” with specific guidance, to particular areas within the Downtown district. In addition, the City could develop and apply a 
series of Design Guidelines to the downtown area, that supplement the guidance provided in the city’s existing zoning language. 
Design Guidelines
Design guidelines serve as an important communication tool between the EDA, the City, property owners and developers. Aspects 
of the design guidelines are outlined as a part of this document, and could also potentially be incorporated into a redevelopment 
overlay zoning district. Design guidelines should become a standard tool in evaluating proposed developments for the area.  These 
guidelines should be rooted in the Preferred Approach Diagram, Redevelopment Master Plan, District Diagrams and subsequent 
phasing diagrams established in the master plan chapter of this document. The application of desired (but not absolutely necessary) 
Design Guidelines could be connected to an incentive-based approach whereby achieving certain design characteristics could lead 
to fast tracking entitlements or obtaining public financial assistance. 
Implementation of the master plan is not a single action, but involves a series of sequenced steps. These steps will be taken over 
time and across multiple phases.  Initial efforts should focus on several implementation initiatives that lay the foundation for change. 
 
These will serve as models for future private development in Downtown Le Sueur.  
During the early years of redevelopment, there are several critical actions the City of Le Sueur can take to reduce development 
constraints, allow for greater investment in public amenities and infrastructure and enhance the market viability of multiple 
locations, including the Valley Green Square Mall.

I m p l e m e n t a t i o n 
Suggested activities to enhance project success include:
»
» Business retention:  This is equal in importance to the next activity, business recruitment.  Effective retention focuses primarily 
on communication with existing businesses, so that public sector leaders are aware of – and thus able to address - potentially 
negative issues confronting businesses.  
»
» Business recruitment:  In recruiting new businesses, the City initially focuses on a series of targeted business types.  These 
business types may include smaller scale professional service providers, restaurant operators, retail shop operators and 
developers, commercial businesses of various sizes, and public and non-profit organizations. Instead of relying on various brokers 
to market individual properties, it must be recognized that many prospective tenants will be new or emerging independent 
businesses.  Rather than wait for these businesses to respond to leasing signs, the City would benefit from the creation of an 
internal marketing effort responsible for outreach.  
»
» Small business development:  The traditional vehicles for encouraging small-business development involve financing and the 
development of small-business incubators.  An alternative strategy might involve an “incubator without walls,” which focuses on 
providing small business counseling and coaching, and has yielded positive results in other communities. 
»
» Explore thematic connections:  To the extent possible, the City should explore the recruitment of institutions, facilities and land 
uses that can promote synergies and thematic connections. Such synergies and connections might involve links to vocational 
and technical educational institutions, artisan organizations, and uses that can grow the popularity of Le Sueur-based events.
»
» Recognize that additional potential should emerge in later years:  While retail, office, and residential projects present the most 
likely potential in the early (0-5 years) stages of redevelopment, such developments, along with additional public improvements, 
should enhance opportunities for additional small-scale commercial business and development over time.  
»
» Start small but with key catalytic projects:  Le Sueur should strategically stage development so that it builds market momentum 
and so that early projects act as positive demonstrations of great things to come in Downtown Le Sueur.  The effort should start 
with small, achievable projects to build a track record of success and to build a diverse base of projects that are viable in the 
market place today. Cultivating a diverse base of businesses will also minimize the extent of competition between businesses in 
the Downtown district.

Phasing
The approach to redevelopment phasing outlined below builds upon known investments and responds to site readiness 
and necessary public improvements. It is anticipated that the full vision outlined in this Master Plan may take over 20 years to 
accomplish. The exact timing of phases will vary based on external factors, including the state of the economy, decisions made by 
individual property owners, and the availability of public funds to support the components of the Downtown Master Plan.
The Master Plan phasing strategy is structured around four general phases:
»
» Immediate, 0-3 years;
»
» Short-Term, 3-5 years;
»
» Mid-Term, 5-10 years;
»
» Long-Term, 10-20 years.
These four plan phases sequentially build to the Redevelopment Master Plan outlined in the master plan chapter. The following 
represents a summary of the four identified redevelopment phases, and the associated projects within each phase, both public and 
private sector. The Immediate and Short-Term phases also examine the anticipated types of sources and uses of funds needed to 
facilitate redevelopment.  The components of each phase are outlined on the following pages. 
Immediate Phase (0-3 Years)
The initial efforts for Downtown Le Sueur will focus on increasing the name recognition of the district in the larger region and 
altering what has served as the “front door” for Downtown for nearly 45 years – the Main Street pedestrian mall.
»
» The City could partner with MnDOT and, for relatively limited costs, erect monuments or enhanced highway signage along 
US 169, at one or both of the Le Sueur exits on the highway. Many other downtowns in Minnesota have erected signage or 
monuments along highways in order to help drive increased traffic and visitation into their districts. This effort could represent a 
relatively “easier” implementation element, during the first few years following adoption of the Plan.
»
» As part of the efforts to support the transformation of the Valley Green Square Mall site, the City could work with the property 
owner or developer of the mall property to finance and execute the extension of Main Street from Bridge Street to Ferry Street.
Short-Term (3 – 5 years)
The State of Minnesota (MnDOT) is scheduled to transfer ownership of State Highway 112 to Le Sueur County within the next five 
years. As part of the transfer of ownership, the County may be able to use funds from MnDOT to finance streetscape and other 
enhancements along the two segments of MN 112 in the Downtown area, including Main Street (north of Bridge Street) and Bridge 
Street (from Main Street to 2nd Street).
Mid-Term (5 – 10 Years)
Assuming that initial redevelopment efforts in the Valley Green Square Mall area gain traction during the first five years of the 
Downtown plan’s implementation, the City could help support and advance a number of improvements between years 5 and 10, 
including the following:
»
» Completion of other streetscape enhancements on other downtown streets not addressed during the first five years of the effort, 
including 2nd Street, Ferry Street, and South Main Street.
»
» Alley improvements (including repaving of alleys, or the enhancement of areas used by pedestrians), at various locations around 
the Downtown district
»
» Potential enhancements to parking lots in the Downtown district (including landscaping and various aesthetic improvements)
»
» Completion of the DNR-designated bike trail connecting to Mankato, including the portion of the alignment located within 
Downtown Le Sueur
»
» The completion of any additional bike connections from the Downtown district and the surrounding neighborhood to the 
Minnesota River
»
» Working with farmers market organizations to establish a recurring market on Main Street
»
» Construction of a key, destination-oriented urban park space in Downtown Le Sueur
»
» Construction of a Snowmobile Trail in the Downtown Area, connecting to the Minnesota River valley
51
I m p l e m e n t a t i o n 
Long-Term (10 – 20 Years)
Bridge Street Bridge (at the railroad) – A key enhancement would involve altering the railroad bridge over Bridge Street, in order to 
increase the clearance of the bridge and to enhance safety through the installation of better biking and walking facilities (including 
bike lanes, trails, or enhanced sidewalks along Bridge Street). This improvement would greatly enhance the safety and functionality 
of the entrance into Downtown from the west, but it may take many years to come to fruition, given the amount of money and time 
necessary to coordinate and finalize improvements with the railroad.
Riverfront Park (to the west of the Union Pacific rail line) – This improvement would involve enhancing the park near the Minnesota 
River into a key destination, just to the west of Downtown. Given the degree of coordination needed with state officials and the 
degree of coordination required to provide trail connections from Downtown to the riverfront area, this enhancement is more likely 
to occur over the longer term (at least 10 to 20 years). This enhancement would provide a key amenity and draw not only for the 
Downtown district, but also for Le Sueur as a whole.
Financing
There are many financial variables involved with complex redevelopment planning projects which can inform the financial analysis 
differently, and these variables can change over time.  The following information highlights the key tools currently available to 
finance the implementation of the redevelopment master plan:
Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
The costs of development and redevelopment may be too great to allow new projects to be financially feasible. This situation 
poses the classic “but for” situation in State law governing tax increment financing.  In these situations, “but for” the use of TIF, the 
development as proposed would not occur. It is clear that the desired redevelopment outlined in this Plan likely will not take place 
without the removal of physical and economic barriers by the City. Tax increment financing is the only tool with the capacity to 
accomplish these objectives.
This master plan assumes that many of the redevelopment projects in downtown Le Sueur will be included in TIF districts at some 
point during the overall timeline of Downtown’s transformation.  In simplest terms, TIF allows the City to capture the net increase 
in property tax revenues resulting from redevelopment and use these monies to pay for the investments required to undertake the 
development. The results of the financial analysis conducted through the planning process clearly shows that private development 
alone will not support the investments required for implementing the master plan. The costs of desired development and 
redevelopment are likely too great to consider all new projects to be financially feasible.
Implementation of the plan will require attention to the key issues that influence the use of TIF, including:
Project Area:
TIF relies on two types of areas. The “project area” is a broader area with common development goals. The “tax increment financing 
district” includes the specific parcels from which tax increment is collected. The project area is important because it defines where 
tax increments can be used (see discussion of “Pooling” that follows). The project area defined for this master plan should also be 
designated as the project area for the purpose of establishing TIF districts.
District Criteria:
The plan assumes that any TIF districts in Downtown Le Sueur will be classified as “redevelopment” under state law. The 
establishment of a redevelopment TIF district relies on three basic criteria (Minnesota Statutes Section 469.174, Subd. 10):
»
» Parcels consisting of 70% of the area of the TIF district are occupied by buildings, streets, utilities, or other improvements;
»
» More than 50% of the buildings, not including outbuildings, are structurally substandard to a degree requiring substantial 
renovation or clearance, and;
»
» These conditions are reasonably distributed throughout the district.
The presence of improved parcels should not pose a constraint. The majority of the redevelopment sites in the Downtown area 
include properties that meet these criteria. The existence and distribution of structurally substandard buildings has not been studied.
The inspection of buildings and the related analysis of identified deficiencies are typically used to determine the ability to meet 
these statutory criteria. This work was not included in the planning process for downtown Le Sueur.
52
Le  S u e u r  D o w n t o w n  M a s t e r  P l a n
Pooling:
Some aspects of the redevelopment plan may be financially feasible while some projects may need to close a financial gap before 
they can occur. Ideally, projects that produce financial surpluses should be used to support those with gaps. This distribution of 
financial resources can occur if the projects are located within the same TIF district. If not, then State law limits the flow of funds 
between TIF districts.
The need to carefully plan the boundaries of the project area and TIF districts is tied to the issue of pooling. The term refers to the 
statutory limitation on spending tax increment beyond the boundaries of the TIF district. Items to be funded by TIF must be located 
within the TIF district or total to an amount of funding that falls within pooling limits.  For redevelopment TIF districts, not more 
than 25% of tax increment may be spent outside of the district. The actual application of pooling limits is often more restrictive.  
Administrative expenses of the TIF district count against the 25% maximum. The amount of revenue available to support eligible 
costs outside of the district may fall in the 15% to 20% range.
Time Constraints:
In a perfect world, the City would establish a TIF district and wait for redevelopment to happen.  Current State law makes this 
approach a risky proposition. TIF districts are subject to several time limitations. The most important of these limitations is the 
five-year rule.  After five years from the date of certification of the TIF district, the use of tax increment is subject to new restrictions. 
Generally, tax increment can only be used to satisfy existing debt and contractual obligations after this date. This rule creates a 
five year window to make commitments for the use of TIF. Additionally, the geographic area of the TIF district can be reduced, 
but not enlarged, after five years from the date of certification. Therefore, if a TIF district is established without a specific plan for 
development, there should be reasonable certainty that development will occur within five years.
The City has the ability to decertify all or part of a district and create a new one. This action sets a new five year clock. However, there 
is a risk that the conditions used to establish the original district will not be present in the future.
Use Limits:
Several specific statutory limitations will influence the use of tax increments in the implementation of the plan.  State law requires 
that at least 90% of revenues from a redevelopment TIF district be used to finance “the cost of correcting conditions that allow 
designation” of the district. The majority of redevelopment and public improvement expenditures in this plan meet these criteria. 
Several important limitations must be noted:
»
» Tax increments cannot be used for “a commons area used as a public park”, thus the park improvements outlined in this plan 
cannot utilize TIF funds for the development and improvement of parks, plazas and other open space areas.
»
» Tax increments cannot be used for public facilities used for “social, recreational, or conference” purposes. As with parks, the statute 
does not define these terms. Special rules apply to public improvements, equipment, or other items outside of the TIF district.
»
» Tax increments cannot be used for these costs if their purpose is primarily aesthetic. If the items serve a functional purpose, tax 
increments can be used unless “their cost is increased by more than 100 percent as a result of the selection of materials, design, 
or type as compared with more commonly used materials, designs, or types for similar improvements, equipment or items”.  To 
avoid this restriction, the street right-of-way to be improved should be included within the boundaries of a TIF district.
Tax Abatement
The name “tax abatement” is misleading. No taxes are abated using this tool. In reality, tax abatement functions similar to TIF (see 
Minnesota Statutes Sections 469.1812 to 469.1815). Each taxing jurisdiction (city, county, school district) has the ability to levy a 
property tax equivalent to taxes paid by a parcel of property. The proceeds of this levy can be used to finance any of the public 
improvements and other redevelopment activities discussed in this plan. Since tax abatement cannot be used for property in a TIF 
district, the best opportunity for this tool lies with locations that do not qualify for a TIF district.
Grants
DEED
The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) offers grants, loans and technical assistance 
for redevelopment projects and activities for communities. Qualifying projects include housing and commercial rehabilitation, 
wastewater treatment facilities and drinking water systems, and contaminated site clean-up. Eligibility of financing through DEED 
I m p l e m e n t a t i o n 53
depends on a number of factors including the type of business, size, location and type of financing needed. 
The Business Development Public Infrastructure Program is a potential grant through DEED which provides funding for infrastructure 
projects in support of economic development. The DEED website (http://www.deed.state.mn.us) provides a number of potential 
financial resources for development and redevelopment projects in Le Sueur to spur business growth in the community.  
Environmental Assistance (EA) Grant
The Minnesota Legislature established the EA grant program to provide financial assistance for the development of environmentally 
sustainable practices in Minnesota through voluntary partnerships and goal-oriented, economically driven approaches to 
pollution prevention and resource conservation. The Environmental Assistance Grant Program consists of a competitive, two-stage 
application process used to identify and assist projects that will be most beneficial in furthering the Agency’s mission of working 
with Minnesotans to protect, conserve, and improve the environment and enhance quality of life, particularly within the focus areas 
identified each fiscal year.
Grants Focused on Clean Water / Stormwater 
The City should investigate opportunities to help generate funds for improvements to the public drainage infrastructure.  Grant 
funds may be available to help construct stormwater treatment facilities, flood improvement projects, streetscapes, and other 
amenities throughout the study area.  In particular, the City should consider Legacy grants for water quality improvements and DNR 
grants for flood improvement projects. 
General Fund
The City may use funds from its general account, known as the General Fund, to pay for any portion or combination of 
improvements outlined in the Downtown master plan. Other projects around the City compete for funding from the General Fund.
Facade Improvement Program
The City could establish a Facade Improvement Program that would provide funds or loans to property owners specifically to 
improve the exteriors of buildings (including awnings, doors, windows, and the actual walls of buildings). Facade programs are a 
common tool to help support efforts to improve the overall aesthetic quality of downtown districts.
Low Interest Loans
The City can also provide low interest loans to businesses or specific development projects to help bridge the gap in financing, to 
make projects viable. The City staff and City Council would need to set priorities and guidelines for any low interest loans made to 
specific projects in the downtown area.
Implementation Actions Matrix Summary
In summary, the Le Sueur Downtown Master Plan outlines a strategy for positive, incremental change throughout the area.  The 
Actions Matrix Summary on the following pages outlines a series of achievable goals over the next 10-15 years.  
While the master plan prescribes a detailed redevelopment approach for specific projects and likely steps, the plan is also flexible in 
its application to allow the City of Le Sueur to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace.  The master plan should be utilized as a living 
document, continually referenced and checked against as development and redevelopment projects occur over time.
