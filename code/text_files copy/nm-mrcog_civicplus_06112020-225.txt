                     ______________________________ 
                     Dewey V. Cave, Executive Director     
                     MRCOG               
 
 
As we look toward the “new normal” in fiscal year 2021, we are reminded of the strides we’ve 
made as a region and draw from our past accomplishments. One thing that remains constant is 
our pursuit of an approach in which all of the communities served by the Mid-Region Council of Governments continue 
to thrive and prosper. 
This year is going to be somewhat different from years past due to the pandemic, namely in “how we meet”. Many of us 
have already become pro’s at using Zoom, and other virtual platforms to continue business as usual…while others among 
us (like myself!) will learn to muddle through. One major endeavor we’ve been involved in is the 2020 Census. As much 
as MRCOG is relied on for data collection, we are also well adept at data sharing. And I’m proud to say we have provided 
a wealth of information to support the very important mission of the Census. 
Other key areas of focus include efforts to finish the long-awaited Regional Transportation Management Center which 
will relocate the NM DOT workers who have occupied our basement now for a few years, and make room for expanded 
operations of MRCOG and Rio Metro. Additionally, we look to develop a regional incident management plan to help 
coordinate critical communication in responding to incidents on our State’s roadways. And on the Rural Transportation 
Planning front, we look to provide staff support for maintaining transportation as a means to strengthen and improve 
important health initiatives.
In FY ’21, we will no doubt see the culmination of PTC or Positive Train Control with testing and revenue demonstration 
by the end of 2020. Additionally, we will be monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on our Rio Metro Transit ridership as we 
adjust to these changes in our service and operations accordingly. 
Another key objective is to remain responsive to all requests for planning assistance dollars, as we work to identify the 
need among our member governments and support them in areas of infrastructure planning and asset management 
planning. And speaking of assistance funding, we will work in close concert with our regional economic development 
partners to respond to expected economic injury as a result of the public health crisis that delivered a negative impact for 
which no community could anticipate or prepare.
In the area of Workforce Development Programs, it has never 
been more important – given our current economic outlook – to 
continue to offer training and outreach to both employers and 
job-seekers alike in the Central Region. We also look toward the 
successful completion of our TechHire NM Program as it winds 
down the final year of the partnership grant that has helped 
train and place many job-seekers in well-paying Information 
Technology positions across our region the past four-years. 
So you see, while our outlook is ambitious, we remain confident 
that together we can achieve our goals for the Region as 
we work with our elected officials and member agencies to 
implement a fiscally responsible budget for fiscal year 2021. 
Sincerely,
