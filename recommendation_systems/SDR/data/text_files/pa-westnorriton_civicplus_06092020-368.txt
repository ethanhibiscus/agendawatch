Commissioners Comments
Public Comment
a.
Recognize individuals that are taxpayers or residents of West Norriton Township 
wishing to offer comment. 
b.
Require the name and address of such persons wishing to comment. 
c.
Permit each individual at minimum one (1) opportunity to speak.  The President 
may require an individual who has already spoken to wait until all others wishing to 
speak have had the opportunity before permitting an additional opportunity to 
speak.  Once all others have had the opportunity to speak, the President shall 
determine whether time would allow for additional comment from the individual 
wishing to speak.  Such a determination shall be based solely on the factor of 
time and shall not be based on the content or viewpoint of the particular individual
(s) seeking additional opportunity to speak. 
d.
Provide for a three (3) minute maximum for each individual to offer public comment 
specifically related to agenda items only.  There shall be no ceding or 
assigning of time.  In no case shall a time limit of fewer than two (2) minutes be 
designated.  It may be requested that a spokesperson from a group address the 
Board of Commissioners. 
e.
Preserve order by prohibiting disruptive conduct including, but not limited to, 
speaking by any person who is not, at that time, taking part in public comment.
