This DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (this “Development Agreement”) is made as of the ____ 
day of _______________, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), by and between the CITY OF ROGERS, 
ARKANSAS, (“the City”), the ROGERS WATERWORKS AND SEWER COMMISSION (“the 
Commission”), the ROGERS WATER UTILITIES (“RWU”); and JAMES R. FENNELL AND TRACI 
D. FENNELL, Co-Trustees of the Fennell Family Trust dated August 5, 2016, (“Owner”) and SEDONA 
FALLS, LLC, its successors and assigns (“Developer”) (together “Owner/Developer”)  The City, the 
Commission, RWU, and Owner/Developer shall collectively be referred to herein as the “Parties” and 
singularly as a “Party”.
W I T N E S S E T H 
WHEREAS, Owner/Developer are the owner and prospective developer of certain real property in 
Benton County, Arkansas, as more completely and initially described in Exhibit “A” attached hereto and 
made a part hereof (the “Property”); 
WHEREAS, Owner/Developer desires to annex the Property into the City and develop the 
Property for use as a single family residential subdivision, which development will include public 
improvements desired, preferred, or required by the City to be extended to, made, maintained, and funded 
by Owner/Developer to or upon the  Property; 
WHEREAS, as a condition to the annexation of the Property, the City requires certain assurances 
from Owner/Developer that Owner/Developer will bear all costs and expenses incurred in the extension 
of water and sewer services to the Property in accordance with the City’s Code of Ordinances, and 
adequate to serve the proposed development, including the construction of a lift station of adequate 
capacity to serve the Property as developed, and for the improvements to Roberts Road as represented by 
Developer, and that such assurances run with the land;  and  
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to enter into this Development Agreement to set forth their mutual 
responsibilities, obligations, and understandings herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual exchange of the covenants and 
agreements hereinafter set forth, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby 
agree as follows:
1.
Development Ordinances.  The Owner/Developer shall in good faith comply with all 
Large Scale Development Ordinances (the “Ordinances”) which apply to and regulate the development of 
the Property.  Pursuant to the Ordinances, or, as the case may be, in addition and supplemental to the 
Ordinances, Owner/Developer covenants and agrees to perform the following at its sole cost and expense:
a.
Extension of water service to the Property from its present terminus to 
the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of Rogers Water Utilities’ Special Contract for 
Facilities Extensions as may then be in effect and as may be modified for Owner/Developer’s particular 
development;
Page 12 of 21
b.
Extension of sanitary sewer service from its present terminus to the Property 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of Rogers Water Utilities’ Special Contract for Facilities 
Extensions as may then be in effect and as may be modified for Owner/Developer’s particular 
development;
c.
Provide a site for and construct any required sewer lift station as may be 
necessary to manage and serve the sewer capacity generated or proposed to be generated by the 
development of the Property in accordance with the terms and conditions of Rogers Water Utilities’ 
Special Contract for Facilities Extensions as may then be in effect and as may be modified for 
Owner/Developer’s particular development; and
d.
Acquire any necessary rights of way and improve the full width of Roberts 
Road from the South boundary of the Bentonville Public Schools property to the South boundary of the 
Property.  Improvement of Roberts Road by Owner/Developer shall be a paved surface in full compliance 
with City street standards.
Nothing herein shall be interpreted to create an obligation in Owner/Developer to develop the 
Property.  The obligations of Owner/Developer as provided above shall only be applicable when and as 
the Property is developed.  The City and the Commission agree to make the services described above 
available for connection by Owner/Developer as described, but only, when and if, Owner/Developer 
actually develops the Property.  Neither the City, nor the Commission, nor RWU shall have any 
obligation to extend water service, sewer service, or any other service to the Property absent 
Owner/Developer’s development of the Property and Owner/Developer’s payment for the extension of 
water service, sewer service, and other services as described herein above.    
2.
In the event that the Commission, on the recommendation of RWU, should
determine that its system and the public would be better served by the construction of a regional lift 
station facility with a capacity in excess of that necessary to serve the development of the Property, 
Owner/Developer shall pay a fee to RWU in an amount equal to the estimated total cost, including land 
acquisition or contribution, for the construction of a local lift station designed to serve only the 
development of the Property.
3.
Fees to City, Commission, and Rogers Water Utilities.  Owner/Developer
will pay all applicable, customary, and standard deposits, service charges and fees, rates, meter 
connection charges, tapping fees, impact fees, access fees, sales taxes, fees for Federal Safe Drinking 
Water Act compliance, and any other applicable charges and fees in accordance with all applicable 
Ordinances of the City of Rogers, the rules, regulations, procedures, and specifications of the 
Commission and the Rogers Water Utilities, and any other applicable law, as they now exist or as they 
may be hereafter amended, said ordinances, rules, regulations, procedures, specifications, and applicable 
laws, being incorporated herein and made part of this Agreement.  Owner/Developer will pay all 
customary and standard development fees charged by the City.
4.
Obligations to Run with the Land.  This Development Agreement shall be 
recorded in the Benton County Real Estate Records, shall act as a covenant running with the land, and 
shall be binding upon Owner or Developer and their heirs, successors, and assigns. Owner/Developer 
covenants and represents that it owns 100% of the property subject to this Agreement and that this 
covenant meets the requirements of Ark. Code. Ann. §18-12-103. Owner/Developer, on behalf of itself 
and its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees that the Property shall not be developed absent 
compliance by Owner/Developer, or by its successors and assigns, with the Owner/Developer’s 
obligations to extend water service, sewer service, and other services as stated herein above to the 
Property at Owner/Developer’s sole costs and expense (or the sole cost and expense of 
Owner/Developer’s successors and assigns). 
Page 13 of 21
5.
No Implied Obligations.  It is expressly agreed that nothing contained in this 
Development Agreement shall be construed to contain a covenant, either expressed or implied either (a) 
by Owner/Developer to commence the development of the Property within a fixed time or (b) to create 
any obligation of the City, the Commission, or RWU not consistent with this Agreement.  Neither the 
City, nor the Commission, nor RWU have any obligation to extend water service, sewer service, or any 
other services to the Property absent Owner/Developer’s development of the Property and 
Owner/Developer’s payment of the costs and expenses for extension of services as stated herein above.  
Owner/Developer, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby waives and relinquishes the 
benefit of any statute, rule, regulation, ordinance, or other provision of law that might require the City, the 
Commission, or RWU to extend services to the property within a certain period of time, including, 
without limitation, the provisions of Ark. Code. Ann. § 14-40-609 (b) (2) (F).  Owner/Developer, on 
behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, promises and covenants that it will not bring any suit, 
action or proceeding against the City, the Commission, or RWU to enforce any provision of any statute, 
rule, regulation, or ordinance that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement or requires any action 
on the part of the City, the Commission, or RWU that conflicts with the City’s, the Commission’s, or 
RWU’s rights under this Agreement.  Owner/Developer, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, 
shall indemnify and hold harmless, the City, the Commission, and RWU from all causes of action, claims, 
demands, liabilities, losses, costs, or expenses for any loss, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
contained in, or arising from, any suit, action, or proceeding brought in violation of this Agreement.
