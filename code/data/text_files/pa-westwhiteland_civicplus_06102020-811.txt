Board of Supervisors 
Guidelines for Virtual Meetings  
6/10/2020 
 
The Board of Supervisors welcomes the opportunity to listen to citizens’ comments on 
matters involving Township business.  To maintain a respectful and productive 
mosphere for public discussion during a virtual/electronic meeting, the following 
guidelines will apply: 
 
1) The public is welcome to join the meeting via computer, tablet, cell phone or 
landline phone. 
 
2) Meeting participants are asked to mute their device to improve the sound 
quality for everyone else. 
 
3) Only one person speaks at a time.  Participants are asked to “raise their hand” 
online or by hitting *9 on their phone and wait until they are recognized by the 
Chair before speaking. 
 
4) Those with questions or comments for anyone at the meeting are expected to 
keep the substance and tone respectful. 
 
5) Commenters will share their name and address for the minutes. 
 
6) In the interest of time, the Board may limit speakers to three minutes each.  
 
 
 
 
When meetings involve long agendas and/or topics about which many people may 
want to comment, the following additional ground rules may apply: 
 
7) The Board has discretion to decide that first preference for speaking will be 
given to West Whiteland residents, followed by non-residents if time permits.  
The Chairman will announce at the beginning of the meeting when this 
procedure will apply and ask that all speakers give their name and address.   
 
8) Participants will refrain from asking questions or responding out of turn to the 
speakers or the Supervisors. 
 
9) Speakers will be asked to keep their comments as brief as possible and limit 
repetition of comments to allow time for others to get their turn. 
 
10) Time limits may be set when needed due to the length of the agenda.

MEMORANDUM 
 
 
 
 
 
DATE: June 5, 2020 
TO: Board of Supervisors 
 
FROM: John R. Weller, AICP 
Director of Planning and Zoning 
 
SUBJECT: Overview of Transportation Capital 
Improvements (Act 209) Plan 
Progress to date and possible next steps 
 
 
 
 
 
Recommended Motion:  None at this time, for discussion only. 
 
On November 24, 2015, the Township Board of Supervisors adopted our Transportation Capital 
Improvements Plan following a public planning process that began in August 2014.  Often 
referred to as the “Act 209 Plan,” the Plan has three principal sections: 
• 
The Land Use Assumptions Report, which projected the new development that could  
be expected within the Plan’s study area (about half of the Township in our case); 
• 
The Roadway Sufficiency Analysis, which reviewed the then-existing road network and 
identified locations where congestion was already a problem and – more importantly – 
where it could become a problem due to the development projected in the prior 
section; and 
• 
The Capital Improvements Plan, which proposed improvements to the roads that would 
mitigate the impact of the projected development.  This section of the Plan did not 
only propose improvements, but also provided schematic designs and cost estimates 
for those improvements. 
 
The great benefit that the Township has received from this Plan is that it allows us to charge 
developers a traffic impact fee that goes toward the cost of constructing the identified 
improvements that will offset the impact of their projects.  In some cases, the developers 
recognize that some improvement will benefit their project and will build it for us. 
 
This Plan has been an astonishing success for us.  The following list describes the projects 
recommended by the Plan and their current status.  They are listed in the order in which they 
appear in the Plan. 
 
1. Connect Waterloo Blvd. and Lincoln Hwy. between Pottstown Pike and Whitford Rd. - 
Constructed by developer of Keva Flats. 
2. Improve intersection of Whitford Rd. and Waterloo Blvd. – Constructed by developer 
of the Waterloo Reserve community. 
3. Extend Waterloo Blvd. to intersect with Lincoln Hwy. at Campbell Blvd. – Constructed 
by developer of the Waterloo Reserve community. 
4. Improve intersection of Whitford Rd. and Lincoln Hwy. – Includes construction of 
additional northbound lane on north leg of intersection, which has now been designed 
and will be constructed as a cooperative effort of the Township and the developer of 
West 
Whiteland 
 
2 
Primrose Daycare, which will occupy the Salon DeSanté site.  Related improvements 
have yet to be constructed. 
5. Improve intersection of Whitford Rd. and Commerce Dr. – Not yet started. 
6. Improve intersection of Whitford Rd. and Clover Mill Rd. – Not yet started. 
7. Intersection of Ship Rd. and Lincoln Hwy. – This is the Ship Road Couplet, which has 
been a recent topic of interest.  The southern portion is to be constructed by the 
developers of two new projects now being reviewed by the Township Planning 
Commission as conditional use applications; the smaller northern portion will be built 
by the Township. 
8. Intersection of Springdale Dr. and Lincoln Hwy. – Some specified improvements to be 
completed as part of the Exton Knoll project, now being reviewed by the Township 
Planning Commission as a land development plan. 
9. Intersection of Phoenixville Pike, Dunwoody Dr., and King Rd. – Constructed by 
developer of the Reserve at Glen Loch community. 
10. Intersection of Phoenixville Pike and King Rd. – Constructed by developer of the 
Reserve at Glen Loch community. 
 
In addition to these construction projects, we have also collected almost $750,000 in traffic 
impact fees from developers of projects who did not build any improvements for us.  That 
funding will pay for the Township match for the grants for the north leg of the Ship Road 
Couplet and the cost of the Township’s portion of the Whitford Road turning lane. 
 
In the course of preparing the Plan, the section of Pottstown Pike between Lincoln Hwy. and 
Boot Rd. was cited as another critical area.  However, due to the regional nature of its 
impact and the tremendous cost of improvements, we concluded that such improvements 
were beyond the capacity of the Township acting alone, so it was deliberately excluded from 
the Plan.  Improving Pottstown Pike will require a cooperative effort with PennDOT and 
perhaps the federal government.  In the interest of identifying possible solutions to the 
chronic congestion in this area, the Township completed the Route 100 Congestion Mitigation 
Study in April 2018, with significant financial support from the Delaware Valley Regional 
Planning Commission, which confirmed that an additional north bound lane on Pottstown Pike 
by Exton train station is feasible.  The study also recommends a new intersection at Route 
100, Mountainview Drive and Whiteland Woods Blvd.  Additional survey and engineering work 
have been done for the new northbound land on Route 100 has been completed to further 
refine the cost estimate and help with the next step of seeking PennDot support and 
federal/state funding for the project. 
 
 
Staff Comment 
 
Although we are barely halfway through the anticipated life cycle of the Transportation 
Capital Improvements Plan, the rate at which its major recommendations are being 
implemented indicates that an update will be needed soon.  The update process will allow us 
to re-evaluate the 2015 Plan and add to it as well.  At this point, Staff has started to develop 
a list of intersections and road segments where congestion appears to be worsening and which 
may be suitable for inclusion in an updated Plan: 
• 
Whitford Rd. at the railroad viaduct by Whitford train station. 
• 
Intersection of Boot Rd. and King Rd. 
 
3 
• 
Intersection of Boot Rd. and Ship Rd.  We note that any projects at this intersection 
would need to be planned and executed in cooperation with West Goshen Township. 
• 
Intersection of Ship Rd. and Valley Hill Rd.  We note that any projects at this 
intersection would need to be planned and executed in cooperation with Uwchlan 
Township since the north leg lies in their jurisdiction. 
 
Improvements to Pottstown Pike would continue to be addressed separately and in 
cooperation with PennDOT.  The upcoming Ship Road Corridor Assessment also will start soon 
and lead to high level recommendations that could include the Ship Road intersections listed 
above. 
 
Staff is not seeking any action by the Board tonight, but we want to bring to your attention 
the success of our current Act 209 Plan and our desire to retain a consultant to do an update 
sometime in the next year or two.  We would also like to know if the Board has any questions 
on these projects or any additions to make to our list of areas for consideration when the Plan 
is updated.

MEMORANDUM 
 
 
 
 
 
DATE: June 5, 2020 
TO: Board of Supervisors 
Mimi Gleason 
 
FROM: Pam Gural-Bear 
Ed Culp 
 
SUBJECT: Authorization to Advertise Amendment to 
the Township Parks and Open Space 
Regulations Ordinance  
 
 
 
 
 
Recommended Motion:  To authorize the advertisement of the amendment to the Township 
Parks and Recreation Areas Ordinance. 
 
The Board discussed the proposed amendments to the Parks Ordinance on November 11, 2019.  
Per that discussion, changes have been made to the draft ordinance to add a prohibition 
against smoking (224-2.Q) and delete the proposed prohibition of go-carts, remote-controlled 
vehicles and other motorized devices in parks without Board approval (former 224-2.N). In 
addition, revisions were made to address the issue of which open space is open to the public, 
and therefore subject to the rules, and which open space is not open to the public (§224-1 
and §224-3). The provision of §2203(b) of the Second Class Township Code into §224-1 which 
states that the rules are to be posted at conspicuous places in parks or recreation grounds, 
establishing a bright line rule that the designated open space must be open to the public and 
the rules posted was also incorporated into the proposed ordinance.  
 
The Ordinance was never formally adopted after the November discussions due to the length 
of agendas early in the year and then delayed again due to Covid-19. Staff is now requesting 
that the Board confirm the earlier decision to authorize advertisement and schedule 
consideration of the Parks Ordinance accordingly.  
 
The Township’s Parks and Recreation Area Ordinance has been in place since 1993.  As the 
Township becomes more developed, the parks are visited by more and more people on a daily 
basis resulting in the activity level in the parks increasing substantially over the years. The 
proposed updates to the parks and open space regulations are designed to help keep our parks 
safe and accessible for everyone to enjoy while assuring that the regulations are enforced 
consistently and fairly.   
 
 
Summary of Changes 
 
The goal of the revisions was to simplify the park rules, provide consistency with Chester 
County and State regulations, and address unauthorized use of parks for personal gain. 
 
• 
Facilities:  Defined an organized activity and group to eliminate conflict for those who 
permit/reserve the fields. Wording was added to clarify who and what activity takes 
priority on a field.  Groups that permit or reserve the field pay for the use and provide the 
Township with a certificate of insurance.

• 
Disposal of Waste:  Added the requirement to dispose of recycling in the designated 
receptacles. 
• 
Firearms:  Changed the wording from banning the carrying of a firearm to banning the 
discharging a firearm in order to comply with state law.  
• 
Pets/Animals: Clarified that leashed dogs are allowed in all Township parks and open 
space unless otherwise posted as prohibited. 
• 
Sound Equipment: Added the clarification that amplification equipment is prohibited 
unless specifically permitted by the Township. 
• 
Explosives and fireworks: Added the clarification that fireworks are prohibited unless 
specifically permitted by the Township. 
• 
Skateboards:  Removed this section as it is not an issue.  
• 
Use of Go-Carts, Remote-Controlled Vehicles and Other Motorized Devices:  Removed this 
section that was proposed to be added to the Parks Ordinance in the last draft. 
• 
Recreation Fields: Removed this regulation as the fields at Boot Road Park South can be 
used for activities other than baseball or softball. 
• 
Unmanned/Manned Aircraft: Added a new section prohibiting use of Township parks, 
trails, or open space to launch or land unmanned or manned aircraft. 
• 
Tobacco-Free Parks and Open Space: Added a new section prohibiting smoking and/or 
possessing a lit tobacco-smoke-producing instrument in any of the Township-owned parks 
and open space. 
• 
Undeveloped Parkland: Clarified passive recreational activities 
• 
Enforcement: Removed Director of Parks and Recreation as that position does not exist.  
• 
Concessions in the Parks: Changed the wording from concessions to Commercial 
Operations and simplified the permit application section.  
 
A draft copy of the Parks and Open Space Rules and Regulations was reviewed by the Public 
Services Commission and their suggestions were incorporated.  The Township Solicitor has 
reviewed the amendment and found it satisfactory.

MEMORANDUM 
 DATE: 
June 4, 2020 
 
 
 
 
TO: 
Board of Supervisors 
 
Mimi Gleason, Township Manager 
 
 
FROM: 
Theodore D. Otteni, P.E. 
 
Director of Public Works 
 
SUBJECT: DKR4, LLC (Primrose Daycare) 
 
PennDOT Right-of-Way Stormwater Management Facilities Agreement 
 
 
Recommended Motion: To authorize the Township Manager to sign the PennDOT 
Right-of-Way Stormwater Management Facilities Agreement with DKR4, LLC, 
including the requirement for a lump sum contribution of $10,000 for future 
maintenance. 
 
Background: 
 
On November 13, 2019 the Board of Supervisors granted final approval of the DKR4, LLC (a.k.a. 
Primrose Daycare), Land Development Plan.  In conjunction with their planned site 
improvements, work will be done along Whitford Road and Lincoln Highway (Business Rt. 30), 
which are PennDOT roads.  In addition to the roadway improvements, the applicant will modify 
and/or relocate drainage facilities along these roads.  Because of this work, PennDOT is requiring 
that a Highway Occupancy Permit (HOP) specifically for the stormwater facilities be 
executed.  Under PennDOT’s policy (see below), the local municipality must assume maintenance 
responsibilities of any new or modified drainage components within PennDOT’s ROW. 
 
The applicant has complied with stormwater regulations and has implemented post-construction 
stormwater controls.    
 
PennDOT Policy and Township Approach 
 
In 2012, PennDOT issued a policy change requiring municipalities to assume maintenance 
responsibilities of underground stormwater components (drainage inlets, pipes, etc.) that are 
installed in conjunction with development projects along State roads.  Prior to the 2012 policy 
change, PennDOT assumed maintenance responsibilities of the underground stormwater 
components.  The policy change was a highly debated topic at the time, since it is believed that 
PennDOT should own and maintain components along a PennDOT road. 
 
The Township has implemented a policy to address future maintenance and repairs associated 
with the new drainage facilities which requires a one-time lump sum contribution from the 
developer to the Township in the amount of 50% of the estimated construction cost for the 
drainage components within PennDOT’s ROW.  The contribution will be deposited into an account 
dedicated for future work on stormwater components along PennDOT roads that the Township 
has been required to maintain.  
 
Maintenance responsibilities for the next fifteen to twenty years is likely to be limited to cleaning 
the inlet grates. The concrete drainage structures and pipe have a service life in excess of fifty 
years.

1. 
ALL CROSSWALKS ARE TO BE 8 FEET WIDE (OR AS NOTED) AND ARE TO BE INSTALLED AS SHOWN 
ON THE SIGNING AND PAVEMENT MARKING PLAN. STOP LINES MUST BE A MINIMUM OF 4 FEET FROM 
THE EDGE OF THE CROSSWALK. 
2. 
ERADICATE ALL EXISTING MARKINGS WHICH ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE USING AN ERADICATION 
METHOD APPROVED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE. 
3. 
THE LIMITS OF ALL SIDEWALK TRANSITION AREAS SHOULD MATCH THE EXISTING SIDEWALK ELEVATION. 
REPLACE SIDEWALK TO THE NEAREST SIDEWALK JOINT. 
4. 
WHEN SIDEWALK IS BEING LOWERED, THE GRASS AREA BEHIND THE SIDEWALK SHOULD BE REGRADED 
WITH A 3: 1 MAXIMUM SLOPE. 
5. 
IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE PROPOSED SIDEWALK CAN BE LOWERED WITH GRADING OR EXTENDED 
DIRECTLY TO THE EXPOSED BUILDING/WALL FACADE, THE CONTRACTOR IS DIRECTED TO COORDINATE 
THE REMOVAL OF THE CHEEK WALL FROM THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION WITH THE RESIDENT ENGINEER 
OR HIS/HER DESIGNEE. 
6. 
RESET ALL UTILITY VALVES, COVERS AND MANHOLES TO GRADE, AS NECESSARY. 
7. 
ALL RAMP LOCATIONS ARE DIMENSIONED FROM THE CONSTRUCTION BASELINE TO THE FACE OF 
DEPRESSED CURB. 
8. 
IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE ANY DISCREPANCIES FOUND BETWEEN THE PROPOSED SLOPES AND 
PROPOSED SPOT ELEVATIONS/ DISTANCES, THE CONlRACTOR MUST CONTACT THE DESIGN ENGINEER 
BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH CONSTRUCTION. 
9. 
UPON COMPLETION OF THE ADA CURB RAMP CONSTRUCTION, THE CONTRACTOR MUST COMPLETE AND 
SUBMIT CS-4401 ADA CURB RAMP INSPECTION FORMS TO THE PENNDOT INSPECTOR, DOCUMENTING 
THE AS-BUILT DIMENSIONS AND SLOPES FOR EACH ADA CURB RAMP CONSTRUCTED BY THE 
PROJECT. PENNDOT WILL THEN CROSS CHECK TO MAKE SURE NONE OF THE AS-BUil 
T VALUES ARE 
WORSE THAN THE DESIGN VALUES DEPICTED ON THE PLAN AND PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. THE 
ENGINEER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLETING AS-BUILT CS-4401 FORMS. 
10. IF A FIELD CONDITION WILL CAUSE A CURB RAMP TO EXCEED THE PLAN VALUES, THIS MUST BE 
BROUGHT TO THE PENNDOT INSPECTOR'S ATTENTION BEFORE THE RAMP IS INSTALLED. THIS MAY 
NECESSITATE CURB RAMP RE-DESIGN AND RE-APPROVAL THROUGH PENNDOTS ADA UNIT BEFORE 
THE INSTALLATION OF THE CURB RAMP. PENN DOT WILL NOT APPROVE AS-BUil 
T NON-COMPLIANT 
CURB RAMPS IF A COMPLIANT DESIGN IS DEPICTED ON THE PLAN, OR HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY 
APPROVED DURING THE DESIGN STAGE OF THE PROJECT. IF A CURB RAMP IS NOT INSTALLED PER 
THE APPROVED PLAN, PENNDOT MAY REQUIRE IT TO BE PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY REMOVED AND 
RECONSTRUCTED. THE ISSUED HIGHWAY OCCUPANCY PERMIT WILL NOT BE CLOSED UNTIL COMPLETED 
CS-4401 FORMS ARE SUBMITTED AND ACCEPTED BY PENNDOT. 
11. ALL PROPOSED SIGNAL FOUNDATIONS SHALL BE INSTALLED FLUSH WITH THE PROPOSED 
RAMP /LANDING/SIDEWALK IN ACCORDANCE WITH PENNDOT

PennDOT Storm Water Facility Policies & Guidebook 
TO: 
District Executives 
FROM: 
R. Scott Christie, P.E. /s/ 
Deputy Secretary for Highway Administration 
This time neutral strike-off letter (SOL) replaces SOL# 4 
70-10-03 dated June 24,2010, and 
applies to Highway Occupancy Permits (HOP) issued after June 24, 2010. We are updating a number 
of 
Publications in order to use consistent terminology (i.e. use of 
the term "storm water" rather than 
"drainage") and introducing the HOP Storm Water Facility Guidebook. This Guidebook (attached) 
assists in the installation or modification of storm water facilities during the HOP process and 
includes alternative storm water designs. It will be placed on PennDOT's website under Highway 
Occupancy Permits and references the "Co-Applicant Agreement", an example of 
which can also be 
accessed online. 
Also attached are replacement sheets to be used to update existing publications. Please 
remove and destroy replaced sheets: 
• 
Pub. 170, HOP Manual, Chapter 3.8, Construction of Sidewalk, Curb, or Storm Water 
Facilities, pp 2 through 3, 80 through 81, and 119. 
• 
Pub. 282, HOP Guidelines, Chapter 3.7, Construction of Sidewalk, Curb, or Storm 
Water Facilities, pp 2 through 3, pg. 5, pp 64 and 65, pg. 91, and pg. 191. 
• 
Pub. 23, Chapter 8.5, Storm Water Maintenance Responsibilities Concerning 
Municipalities, pp 8-i, 8-10 & 11, and Exhibit 7, Background for Storm Water Facilities 
Policy, pp 8-22 and 23. 
Other chapters of 
Pub. 23 will be impacted by these terminology changes and will be revised 
through future updates. 
It is vital that District HOP application reviewers continue to meet with applicants and their 
engineer before design begins, since the HOP policy requires a local government to be a co-applicant 
for certain types of 
permits. If 
the local government does not wish to be a co-applicant the use of 
alternative storm water designs should be considered. In such cases the private land owner would be 
the sole HOP applicant. 
If 
you have any questions in regards to the attached policy, please contact Daryl St. Clair, 
P.E., Acting Director, Bureau of 
Highway Safety and Traffic Engineering, at (717) 787-7350.

determined will then serve as the basis for the remuneration requested from the property 
owner. 
2. 
Drainage Structures. -- In order to conform to Title 23, Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), applicants for a permit may not be permitted to encroach or install structures 
on the right-of-way unless: 
a. It is in the "public interest", and 
b. The encroachment will not impair the highway (as defined) or interfere with the 
safe and free flow of traffic and drainage. 
Both conditions must be satisfied; it is not permissible to allow right-of-way 
occupancies solely for the convenience of the permittee. Also, do not allow abutting 
property owners to occupy highway right-of-way with their site improvements if there 
are reasonable alternatives. 
FHWA may allow the placement of rock-lined ditches from an adjacent property to 
highway drainage systems provided there is compliance with other requirements 
(e.g., available system capacity). However, a proposal for other encroachments 
(including pipes and end treatments) must document that the two conditions cited 
above are satisfied. If this justification is not included with the permit application, 
promptly return the application to the applicant as incomplete. 
Consistent with Regulation 441, permits will not normally be issued for occupancy of 
any limited access highway by drainage structures which alter or connect with a 
PENNDOT drainage facility. In special cases, PENNDOT, with the written approval 
of the FHWA, may make exceptions. 
An application for a drainage facility not altering or connected to a Department 
drainage facility that proposes to occupy limited access right-of-way must be 
consistent with the Design Manual, Part 5, as specified in Chapter 459. 
Construction of Sidewalk, Curb, or Storm Water Facilities 
Free Permits will be issued in the name of a local government for the construction or 
modification of sidewalk, curb or storm water facilities being installed at no additional cost 
or expense to Penn DOT. Local governments are townships, cities, boroughs, incorporated 
towns, home rule municipalities, and counties. The Department may also issue a permit to 
an individual property owner for the construction of such structures within its property 
frontage limits provided the permit is recorded. A local government may impose additional 
requirements upon a property owner for the construction of curbs and sidewalks provided 
that they do not conflict with the Department's standards. (See Chapter 5. 1 - Storm Water 
Facility Maintenance - Responsibility for additional guidance on who shall apply for certain 
storm water facility modifications).

Curbs and sidewalks are to be designed and installed consistent with Sections 630, 
676 and 694 of Publication 408, Roadway Construction Standards RC-64M and RC-67M, 
and Design Manual, Part 2, Chapter 6. Also see Section 416 of the State Highway Law. 
Storm water facilities are to be designed and installed consistent with applicable 
provisions of Design Manual, Part 2, Chapter 2; the Maintenance Manual, Chapter 8.5; 
Publication 408 and Roadway Construction Standards RC-30M thru RC-46M. Also see 
Sections 417 and 421 of the State Highway Law. 
Applications to construct or modify curb, sidewalk or storm water facility will be 
reviewed by District staff to determine the effects on safety, capacity, existing utility facilities 
and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
If the proposed sidewalk, curb or storm water facility would have an adverse effect 
on safety or capacity, the application will not be approved. 
If the proposed sidewalk, curb or storm water facilities would have an adverse effect 
on highway drainage or change the rate, volume, or quality of storm water runoff, the 
Permittee will be required to (1) construct all remedial storm water facilities, (2) assume all 
future maintenance obligations of the storm water facilities, and (3) record the permit. 
If the proposed sidewalk, curb or storm water facility will require the relocation of any 
utility facility, the applicant must submit written acknowledgment from all affected Utilities 
that the Utilities agree to relocate to the location designated on the plans at no additional 
cost to Penn DOT. 
Following are regulatory references relating to drainage. (Also see State Highway

Storm Water Facility Maintenance -- Responsibility 
Authority. PennDOT has statutory authority to maintain adequate highway storm 
water (State Highway Law, 36 P.S. Section 670 - 417) and to regulate the use of State 
highways (State Highway Law, 36 P.S. Section 670 - 420; 67 Pa. Code Section 441.2). 
Refer to Chapter 8 of the Maintenance Manual for additional information related to 
maintenance responsibilities. 
Pipe culverts placed under a driveway to accommodate the property owner 
enables safe vehicular access without adversely affecting highway storm water. If the 
driveway did not exist, a pipe culvert would not be necessary to maintain highway storm 
water. Pipe culverts can become blocked and cause more potential problems than 
driveways with swales. Use swales, where feasible, across driveways. If swales are not 
feasible, pipes may be allowed. 
Pipe culverts placed under a driveway benefit the property owner as well as the 
traveling public. A pipe culvert can reduce the property owner's cost of maintaining the 
driveway. Maintenance of a pipe culvert installed under an access is the property 
owner's responsibility (under Regulation 441.6(12)). Although PennDOT may initially 
install a pipe culvert under a driveway as part of a construction or maintenance project, 
it is primarily the property owner's responsibility to maintain the pipe culvert just as it is 
primarily the property owner's responsibility to maintain safe sight distance and to 
remove snow from the driveway. These responsibilities are not limited to "permitted" 
driveways; thus, whether or not a valid permit exists does not alter the fact that the 
owner is responsible for access maintenance. 
Persons owning property abutting a State highway have a constitutional right of 
reasonable (i.e., safe and operationally sound) access to public roads. However, along 
with this right there is also a responsibility to provide continued safe and operationally 
sound access to motorists and a responsibility not to adversely affect the rights thru-
traffic has to safe and operationally sound highway movement. 
Of course, if a nonfunctioning pipe culvert is creating or has the potential to 
create a hazardous roadway condition, PennDOT may, after appropriate notice, take 
action to eliminate the hazard (and invoice the property owner for all costs under 
Program 612, using the applicable Object Codes). Under Regulation 441.10, Penn 
DOT 
has the authority to remove, sever or block drainage structures constructed or altered 
without a permit or in violation of the regulations. 
Where storm water structures (other than a pipe culvert under a minimum use 
driveway) are permitted in PennDOT right-of-way or are permitted to connect to 
PennDOT storm water facilities, the Permit shall state that the permittee is responsible 
for future maintenance of the storm water structures being installed (see Permit 
Condition Code #388). Permits that allow the above types of storm water facilities need 
to be recorded.

It is recommended that every new land development project be designed to 
retain the site development storm water runoff or a design that does not require storm 
water to be directed to the State highway right-of-way. However, this is not always 
possible and PennDOT is faced with site development storm water designs that are 
directing and discharging storm water toward and within the State highway right-of-way. 
In addition, many municipalities, by ordinance, require, as part of the local land 
development process, the installation of curbing along the site frontage adjacent to a 
State highway. Often when curbing is introduced, there is a need to manage storm 
water via the installation of enclosed surface storm water facilities. Penn 
DOT prefers 
the design of storm water systems through the use of open ditches and cross pipes 
which reduces the cost of highway projects and future maintenance. 
New land development should be designed to ensure that the quantity and 
volume of storm water directed onto the State highway right-of-way is properly 
managed. Penn DOT is not obligated to issue a highway occupancy permit for the use of 
its right-of-way for storm water purposes, but may do so in such situations within its 
discretion for economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development. Permits 
related to new land development may be issued to private applicants if for open surface 
storm water facilities. Permits for enclosed surface storm water facilities connecting to 
highway storm water facilities shall be issued to a local government or a local 
government and the private owner of the new land development as co-applicants. This 
policy applies to permits being issued after June 24, 2010. Exceptions may be granted 
from PennDOT's Central Office for land development plans approved before June 24, 
2010. Condition Code #389 should be used if there is a private co-applicant. Permits for 
enclosed surface storm water facilities not connected to highway storm water facilities 
can be issued to public or private applicants if they can be defined as a utility facility 
under Pa Code, Title 67, Chapter 459. Local governments are townships, cities, 
boroughs, incorporated towns, home rule municipalities, and counties. 
Additional guidance, broken into five different scenarios, indicating who the 
permit applicant shall be for a particular type of proposed storm water facility within 
PennDOT right-of-way is as follows: 
1. 
Storm water facilities draining or conveying drainage under a 
proposed driveway or local road. 
a. Permittee - driveway/local road applicant. 
b. Examples - driveway pipes, culverts, ditches, swales and/or associated 
open and enclosed surface storm water facilities under or appurtenant to 
the driveway or local road that serve to drain the driveway or local road or 
convey drainage under the driveway or local road.

2. 
Open Surface storm water facilities draining more than a proposed 
driveway or local road, whether connected to a highway storm water 
facility or not. 
a. Permittee - driveway/local road applicant. 
b. Examples - ditches, curbing, swales and inlets servicing development of 
the land in general and typically not under or appurtenant to the driveway 
or local road. 
c. Local government approval is required if a local ordinance addressing 
storm water exists. If a local ordinance does not exist, county government 
should be consulted to determine if there are any county imposed 
requirements for which approval must be obtained from the county. [As a 
matter of policy for local coordination purposes.] 
d. PennDOT is not required to allow use of its right-of-way for this general 
land development storm water; but may do so within its discretion for 
economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development. 
3. 
Enclosed surface storm water facilities draining more than a 
proposed driveway or local road and physically or hydraulically 
connected to an existing or new highway storm water facility. 
a. Permittee - local government or local government and landowner as co-
permittees. [The local government may pass responsibility onto landowner 
through land development process.] 
b. Examples - pipes servicing development of the land in general and 
typically not under or appurtenant to the driveway or local road. 
c. Penn 
DOT is not required to allow the use of its right-of-way for this 
general land development storm water; but may do so within its discretion 
for economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development. 
d. The following conditions shall be added to the permit if there is a private 
co-applicant (Condition Code #389): 
1. 
STORM WATER FACILITIES INSTALLED BY THIS PERMIT ARE 
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
TO CONTINUALLY MAINTAIN OR REPLACE. 
2. 
LANDOWNER CO-PERMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PROVIDING FUNDING TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO 
OFFSET FUTURE MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE PERMITTED STORM WATER FACILITY(IES). 
e. Maintenance responsibilities under the permit only apply to the storm 
water facilities installed as part of the permit. 
f. A local maintenance indemnity and funding agreement (co-applicant 
agreement) is recommended to be recorded so that the agreement will 
legally bind any subsequent owner of the property serviced by the facility.

4. 
New or modified enclosed surface storm water facilities draining the 
highway and/or adjacent properties. 
a. Permittee - local government or local government and landowner as co-
permittees. [The local government may pass responsibility on to developer 
through land development process.] 
b. Examples - enclosed surface storm water facilities created due to the 
installation of curbing along the highway. [This scenario is different from 
scenario three because the facility is draining the highway and/or adjacent 
properties rather than the landowner's property.] 
c. PennDOT is not required to allow the use of its right-of-way for this 
general land development storm water; but may do so within its discretion 
for economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development. 
d. The following conditions shall be added to the permit if there is a private 
co-applicant (Condition Code #389): 
1. 
STORM WATER FACILITIES INSTALLED BY THIS PERMIT ARE 
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
TO CONTINUALLY MAINTAIN OR REPLACE. 
2. 
LANDOWNER CO-PERMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PROVIDING FUNDING TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO 
OFFSET FUTURE MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE PERMITTED STORM WATER FACILITY(IES). 
e. Maintenance responsibilities under the permit only apply to the storm 
water facilities installed as part of the permit. 
f. A local maintenance indemnity and funding agreement (co-applicant 
agreement) is recommended to be recorded so that the agreement will 
legally bind any subsequent owner of the property serviced by the facility. 
5. 
Enclosed storm water drainage facilities not connected to a highway 
storm water facility. 
a. Permittee - landowner or local government. [These are utility facilities 
under Pa Code, Title 67, Chapter 459.] 
b. Examples - pipes servicing the development of the land in general that 
are independent of highway storm water facilities. 
c. The system must be deemed to directly or indirectly serve the public or 
any part thereof. §459.1 (definition of utility facility). [This is an easier 
determination if the permittee is the local government.] 
The above scenarios have been developed in view of several circumstances: Section 
421 of the State Highway Law, 36 P.S. § 670-421, which indicates: "It is unlawful for any 
person to discharge sewage or drainage, except surface drainage, on, or within the 
legal limits of, any State highway"; the constitutional right of access held by landowners 
abutting non-limited access highways; the public nature of local governments as well as 
their historic and statutory responsibility for storm water management within their 
geographic boundaries and their review and approval of land development plans, which 
frequently include storm water management; Pa Code, Title 67, Chapter 441 and

Asset Management of Cross Pipes 
Storm water maintenance responsibilities will be recorded in the Roadway 
Management System (RMS) along with other Systematic Techniques to Analyze and 
Manage Pennsylvania Pavements (STAMPP) inventory and condition data as defined in 
Publication 73, the Drainage Condition Survey Field Manual. Use a "O" for non-
PennDOT maintained, and a "1" for PennDOT maintained cross pipes. This will allow 
the facility to be plotted on the straight-line-diagrams. Field data is expected to be 
available in the RMS database for input after January 2010. 
New cross pipe information shall be provided to the District RMS Coordinator 
when other highway occupancy permit (HOP) pavement related data is provided 
through the Pavement History Update Policy implemented in March 2009. Publication

b. The encroachment will not impair the highway (as defined) or interfere with the 
safe and free flow of traffic and drainage. 
Both conditions must be satisfied; it is not permissible to allow right-of-way occupancies 
solely for the convenience of the permittee. Also, abutting property owners will not be 
allowed to occupy highway right-of-way with their site improvements if there are reasonable 
alternatives. 
FHWA may allow the placement of rock-lined ditches from an adjacent property to highway 
drainage systems provided there is compliance with other requirements (e.g., available 
system capacity). However, a proposal for other encroachments (including pipes and end 
treatments) must document that the two conditions cited above are satisfied. If this 
justification is not included with the permit application, it will be promptly returned to the 
applicant as incomplete. 
Consistent with Regulation 441, permits will not normally be issued for occupancy of any 
limited access highway by drainage structures which alter or connect with a PENN DOT 
drainage facility. In special cases, PENN 
DOT, with the written approval of the FHWA, may 
make exceptions. 
An application for a drainage facility not altering or connected to a Department drainage 
facility that proposes to occupy limited access right-of-way must be consistent with the 
Design Manual, Part 5, as specified in Chapter 459. 
Construction of Sidewalk, Curb, or Storm Water Facilities 
Free Permits will be issued in the name of a local government for the construction or 
modification of sidewalk, curb or storm water facilities being installed at no additional cost 
or expense to Penn DOT. Local governments are townships, cities, boroughs, incorporated 
towns, home rule municipalities, and counties. The Department may also issue a permit to 
an individual property owner for the construction of such structures within its property 
frontage limits provided the permit is recorded. A local government may impose additional 
requirements upon a property owner for the construction of curbs and sidewalks provided 
that they do not conflict with the Department's standards. (See Chapter 5. 1 - Storm Water 
Facility Maintenance - Responsibility for additional guidance on who shall apply for certain 
storm water facility modifications). 
Curbs and sidewalks are to be designed and installed consistent with Sections 630, 
676 and 694 of Publication 408, Roadway Construction Standards RC-64M and RC-67M, 
and Design Manual, Part 2, Chapter 6. Also see Section 416 of the State Highway Law. 
Storm water facilities are to be designed and installed consistent with applicable 
provisions of Design Manual, Part 2, Chapter 2; the Maintenance Manual, Chapter 8.5; 
Publication 408 and Roadway Construction Standards RC-30M thru RC-46M. Also see 
Sections 417 and 421 of the State Highway Law.

Applications to construct or modify curb, sidewalk or storm water facilities will be 
reviewed by District staff to determine the effects on safety, capacity, existing utility facilities 
and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
If the proposed sidewalk, curb or storm water facilities would have an adverse effect 
on safety or capacity, the application will not be approved. 
If the proposed sidewalk, curb or storm water facilities would have an adverse effect 
on highway storm water or change the rate, volume, or quality of storm water runoff, the 
Permittee will be required to (1) construct all remedial storm water facilities, (2) assume all 
future maintenance obligations of the storm water facilities, and (3) record the permit. 
If the proposed sidewalk, curb or storm water facilities will require the relocation of 
any utility facility, the applicant must submit written acknowledgment from all affected 
Utilities that the Utilities agree to relocate to the location designated on the plans at no 
additional cost to PennDOT.

Storm Water Facility Maintenance -- Responsibility 
Authority. PennDOT has statutory authority to maintain adequate highway storm 
water (State Highway Law, 36 P.S. Section 670 - 417) and to regulate the use of State 
highways (State Highway Law, 36 P.S. Section 670 - 420; 67 Pa. Code Section 441.2). 
Refer to Chapter 8 of the Maintenance Manual for additional information related to 
maintenance responsibilities. 
Pipe culverts placed under a driveway to accommodate the property owner 
enables safe vehicular access without adversely affecting highway storm water. If the 
driveway did not exist, a pipe culvert would not be necessary to maintain highway storm 
water. Pipe culverts can become blocked and cause more potential problems than 
driveways with swales. Use swales, where feasible, across driveways. If swales are not 
feasible, pipes may be allowed. 
Pipe culverts placed under a driveway benefit the property owner as well as the 
traveling public. A pipe culvert can reduce the property owner's cost of maintaining the 
driveway. Maintenance of a pipe culvert installed under an access is the property 
owner's responsibility (under Regulation 441.6(12)). Although PennDOT may initially 
install a pipe culvert under a driveway as part of a construction or maintenance project, 
it is primarily the property owner's responsibility to maintain the pipe culvert just as it is 
primarily the property owner's responsibility to maintain safe sight distance and to 
remove snow from the driveway. These responsibilities are not limited to "permitted" 
driveways; thus, whether or not a valid permit exists does not alter the fact that the 
owner is responsible for access maintenance. 
Persons owning property abutting a State highway have a constitutional right of 
reasonable (i.e., safe and operationally sound) access to public roads. However, along 
with this right there is also a responsibility to provide continued safe and operationally 
sound access to motorists and a responsibility not to adversely affect the rights thru-
traffic has to safe and operationally sound highway movement. 
Of course, if a nonfunctioning pipe culvert is creating or has the potential to 
create a hazardous roadway condition, PennDOT may, after appropriate notice, take 
action to eliminate the hazard (and invoice the property owner for all costs under 
Program 612, using the applicable Object Codes). Under Regulation 441.10, Penn DOT 
has the authority to remove, sever or block storm water structures constructed or 
altered without a permit or in violation of the regulations. 
Where storm water structures (other than a pipe culvert under a minimum use 
driveway) are permitted in PennDOT right-of-way or are permitted to connect to 
PennDOT storm water facilities, the Permit shall state that the permittee is responsible 
for future maintenance of the storm water structures being installed (see Permit 
Condition Code #388). Permits that allow the above types of storm water facilities need 
to be recorded.

PENNDOT PUB 282 
HIGHWAY OCCUPANCY PERMIT (HOP) GUIDELINES Page 91A (REV. 12-11) 
It is recommended that every new land development project be designed to 
retain the site development storm water runoff or a design that does not require storm 
water to be directed to the State highway right-of-way. However, this is not always 
possible and PennDOT is faced with site development storm water designs that are 
directing and discharging storm water toward and within the State highway right-of-way. 
In addition, many municipalities, by ordinance, require, as part of the local land 
development process, the installation of curbing along the site frontage adjacent to a 
State highway. Often when curbing is introduced, there is a need to manage storm 
water via the installation of enclosed surface storm water facilities. Penn 
DOT prefers 
the design of storm water systems through the use of open ditches and cross pipes 
which reduces the cost of highway projects and future maintenance. 
New land development should be designed to ensure that the quantity and 
volume of storm water directed onto the State highway right-of-way is properly 
managed. PennDOT is not obligated to issue a highway occupancy permit for the use of 
its right-of-way for storm water purposes, but may do so in such situations within its 
discretion for economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development. Permits 
related to new land development may be issued to private applicants if for open surface 
storm water facilities. Permits for enclosed surface storm water facilities connecting to 
highway storm water facilities shall be issued to a local government or a local 
government and the private owner of the new land development as co-applicants. This 
policy applies to permits being issued after June 24, 2010. Exceptions may be granted 
from PennDOT's Central Office for land development plans approved before June 24, 
2010. Condition Code #389 should be used if there is a private co-applicant. Permits for 
enclosed surface storm water facilities not connected to highway storm water facilities 
can be issued to public or private applicants if they can be defined as a utility facility 
under Pa Code, Title 67, Chapter 459. Local governments are townships, cities, 
boroughs incorporated towns, home rule municipalities, and counties 
Additional guidance, broken into five different scenarios, indicating who the 
permit applicant shall be for a particular type of proposed storm water facility within 
PennDOT right-of-way is as follows: 
1. 
Storm water facilities draining or conveying drainage under a 
proposed driveway or local road. 
a. Permittee - driveway/local road applicant. 
b. Examples - driveway pipes, culverts, ditches, swales and/or associated 
open and enclosed surface storm water facilities under or appurtenant to 
the driveway or local road that serve to drain the driveway or local road or 
convey drainage under the driveway or local road. 
2. 
Open Surface storm water facilities draining more than a proposed 
driveway or local road, whether connected to a highway storm water 
facility or not. 
a. Permittee - driveway/local road applicant.

b. Examples - ditches, curbing, swales and inlets servicing development of 
the land in general and typically not under or appurtenant to the driveway 
or local road. 
c. Local government approval is required if a local ordinance addressing 
storm water exists. If a local ordinance does not exist, county government 
should be consulted to determine if there are any county imposed 
requirements for which approval must be obtained from the county. [As a 
matter of policy for local coordination purposes.] 
d. PennDOT is not required to allow use of its right-of-way for this general 
land development storm water; but may do so within its discretion for 
economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development. 
3. 
Enclosed surface storm water facilities draining more than a 
proposed driveway or local road and physically or hydraulically 
connected to an existing or new highway storm water facility. 
a. Permittee - local government or local government and landowner as co-
permittees. [The local government may pass responsibility onto landowner 
through land development process.] 
b. Examples - pipes servicing development of the land in general and 
typically not under or appurtenant to the driveway or local road. 
c. PennDOT is not required to allow the use of its right-of-way for this 
general land development storm water; but may do so within its discretion 
for economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development. 
d. The following conditions shall be added to the permit if there is a private 
co-applicant (Condition Code #389): 
1. 
STORM WATER FACILITIES INSTALLED BY THIS PERMIT ARE 
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
TO CONTINUALLY MAINTAIN OR REPLACE. 
2. 
LANDOWNER CO-PERMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PROVIDING FUNDING TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO 
OFFSET FUTURE MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE PERMITTED STORM WATER FACILITY(IES). 
e. Maintenance responsibilities under the permit only apply to the storm 
water facilities installed as part of the permit. 
f. A local maintenance indemnity and funding agreement (co-applicant 
agreement) is recommended to be recorded so that the agreement will 
legally bind any subsequent owner of the property serviced by the facility. 
4. 
New or modified enclosed surface storm water facilities draining the 
highway and/or adjacent properties. 
a. Permittee - local government or local government and landowner as co-
permittees. [The local government may pass responsibility on to developer 
through land development process.]

HIGHWAY OCCUPANCY PERMIT (HOP) GUIDELINES Page 91C (REV. 12-11) 
b. Examples - enclosed surface storm water facilities created due to the 
installation of curbing along the highway. [This scenario is different from 
scenario three because the facility is draining the highway and/or adjacent 
properties rather than the landowner's property.] 
c. PennDOT is not required to allow the use of its right-of-way for this 
general land development storm water; but may do so within its discretion 
for economy of maintenance as well as supporting land development.

facilities installed as part of the permit. 
f. A local maintenance indemnity and funding agreement (co-applicant 
agreement) is recommended to be recorded so that the agreement will 
legally bind any subsequent owner of the property serviced by the facility. 
5. 
Enclosed surface storm water facilities not connected to a highway 
drainage facility. 
a. Permittee - landowner or local government. [These are utility facilities 
under Pa Code, Title 67, Chapter 459.] 
b. Examples - pipes servicing the development of the land in general that 
are independent of highway storm water facilities. 
c. The system must be deemed to directly or indirectly serve the public or 
any part thereof. §459.1 (definition of utility facility). [This is an easier 
determination if the permittee is the local government.] 
The above scenarios have been developed in view of several circumstances: Section 
421 of the State Highway Law, 36 P.S. § 670-421, which indicates: "It is unlawful for any 
person to discharge sewage or drainage, except surface drainage, on, or within the 
legal limits of, any State highway"; the constitutional right of access held by landowners 
abutting non-limited access highways; the public nature of local governments as well as 
their historic and statutory responsibility for storm water management within their 
geographic boundaries and their review and approval of land development plans, which 
frequently include storm water management; Pa Code, Title 67, Chapter 441 and 
Chapter 459; and the Department's Maintenance Manual, Department Publication 23, 
Chapter 8.

Asset Management of Cross Pipes 
Storm water maintenance responsibilities will be recorded in the Roadway 
Management System (RMS) along with other Systematic Techniques to Analyze and 
Manage Pennsylvania Pavements (STAMPP) inventory and condition data as defined in 
Publication 73, the Drainage Condition Survey Field Manual. Use a "O" for non-
PennDOT maintained, and a "1" for PennDOT maintained cross pipes. This will allow 
the facility to be plotted on the straight-line-diagrams. Field data is expected to be 
available in the RMS database for input after January 2010. 
New cross pipe information shall be provided to the District RMS Coordinator 
when other highway occupancy permit (HOP) pavement related data is provided 
through the Pavement History Update Policy implemented in March 2009. Publication

A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE TOWNSHIP MANAGER TO 
EXECUTE, 
ENDORSE 
AND 
DELIVER 
ANY 
AND 
ALL 
STANDARD LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AND TO 
APPROVE INTERIM ESCROW RELEASES AND APPOINTING 
THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS AS SECOND TOWNSHIP 
ENGINEER TO CERTIFY INTERIM ESCROW RELEASES  
 
WHEREAS, Article V, Section 509 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code 
(MPC) authorizes the deposit with the Township of financial security to guarantee the construction 
of certain improvements depicted on approved land development plans; and  
 
WHEREAS, Article V, Section 509(j) of the MPC requires a municipal engineer to certify, 
in writing, to the governing body that subdivision and land development improvements have been 
completed in accordance with the approved plan in order for the governing body to authorize 
interim escrow releases of financial security; and 
 
WHEREAS, Article I, Section 107(a) of the MPC defines “municipal engineer” as a 
professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, duly appointed as 
the engineer for a municipality; and 
 
WHEREAS, Article XII, Section 1201 of the Pennsylvania Second Class Township Code 
authorizes the appointment of a Township Engineer; and  
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors appointed SSM Group, a professional engineering 
firm as the Township Engineer at the organization meeting on January 6, 2020; and 
 
WHEREAS, Theodore D. Otteni, the Director of Public Works of West Whiteland 
Township, is a Professional Engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and 
 
WHEREAS, there is no restriction against appointing a second professional engineer 
licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a municipal engineer for certifying interim 
escrow releases under the MPC; and 
 
WHEREAS, the process for interim escrow releases of financial security for certain smaller 
projects can be completed by the Director of Public Works with greater efficiency and reduced 
cost than the professional engineering firm; and 
 
 WHEREAS, the Township has availed itself of the authority granted pursuant to Section 
509 of the MPC by establishing certain standardized agreements as approved from time to time 
by the Board of Supervisors as typical conditions of final subdivision or land development plan 
approval, which include but are not necessarily limited to the Developer Agreement, the Financial 
Security Agreement, the Landscaping Restrictive Covenant, and the Stormwater Management 
Facilities Maintenance Agreement (the “Agreements”); and 
 
2 
 
WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 1301(B) of the Second Class Township Code authorizes 
the Board of Supervisors to delegate any of their nonlegislative powers and duties to the Township 
Manager; and 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Supervisors of West Whiteland 
Township hereby authorizes and approves the following:  
 
1.  
The Board of Supervisors of West Whiteland Township hereby appoints the 
Director of Public Works, Theodore D. Otteni P.E., in addition to SSM Group, to be the Township 
Engineer for the purpose of certifying that the work for which the developer has sought an interim 
release of financial security has been completed in accordance with the approved plan, based 
upon his review of the inspections conducted by West Whiteland Township staff.  
 
2. 
The Township Manager is authorized to approve an interim release of financial 
security following receipt of certification by any approved Township Engineer appointed by the 
Board of Supervisors. 
 
3.  
The Township Manager is authorized to execute the Agreements, as long as no 
material revisions or additions are made to the Agreements and the Board of Supervisors 
previously approved the final subdivision or land development plan at a public meeting with a 
condition authorizing the Township Manager’s signature. 
 
4. 
This resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption. 
 
 
ADOPTED this 10TH day of JUNE, 2020.

MEMORANDUM 
DATE:

TO: 
Board of Supervisors 
 
Mimi Gleason, Township Manager 
 
 
FROM: 
Theodore D. Otteni, P.E., Director of Public Works 
 
 
 
SUBJECT: 
Truck Restrictions on Township Roadways 
 
 
RECOMMENDED MOTIONS:  
Direct staff to initiate the process of amending Township Ordinance §300-16: Trucks prohibited 
on certain streets; exceptions. 
 
BACKGROUND: 
The Township has enacted an Ordinance prohibiting “truck” type vehicles from traveling down 
certain roadways in the Township. “Trucks” are defined as “a motor vehicle designated, used or 
maintained primarily for the transportation of property, freight, or merchandise.” The traffic from 
these types of vehicles significantly degrade the condition of the roadways and cause a nuisance 
to residential developments otherwise undisturbed. We are proposing extending one road 
limitation and adding two new roads to the existing list of prohibited streets. 
 
Amend: 
Kirkland Avenue (from Boot Road to King Road) – There is an existing restriction to truck traffic 
on Kirkland Avenue from Route 100 to Boot Road. There has been an increase in truck traffic on 
the suggested section of road likely due to increased usage of GPS navigation. 
 
Add: 
Station Place (from Boot Road to King Road) – There has been an increase in truck traffic on this 
road likely due to increased usage of GPS navigation. 
 
Creamery Way (from Campbell Boulevard to Whitford Road) – This is an agreed upon condition 
of the Land Development plan approval for the Parkview at Oaklands apartments.
