Minutes 
The minutes of the February 17, 2020 Board meeting were approved as submitted. 
 
Welcome 
Hamilton Holloway welcomed everyone and thanked Board members for their patience as the CSB 
navigates through new processes in response to COVID-19 while also continuing operations as best 
possible. He also thanked Ivy Sager and the Management Team for outstanding leadership and service 
through all of this.  
 
Executive Director's Report 
Ms. Sager began by announcing the Management Team is participating in the Board meeting through 
Zoom and each is available to answer any questions. 
  
Ms. Sager spoke to the redesign of nearly everything the agency does in commitment to continuing to 
serve the Hanover community and CSB clients during COVID-19. Ms. Sager announced that attention has 
now turned to planning for reopening and returning to more typical operations. She noted that the agency’s 
front door will likely reopen on June 1, with new protocols in place. Staff will begin to be return back to 
the office, with telehealth continuing as long as regulatory bodies continue imposing relaxed requirements.  
Day Programs will be the last to reopen, and no specific date is scheduled at this point. 
 
Jim Hunt asked if any CSB staff have tested positive for COVID-19. Ms. Sager confirmed no known 
positive testing for staff; several clients have reported positive testing, with one client passing away due 
to complications of COVID-19. 
 
Lori Spain asked how clients are being seen. Ms. Sager confirmed the use of telehealth – either by video 
conference or by phone, with very few clients being seen face-to-face. If face-to-face contact is necessary, 
protocol is in place for staff’s required use of PPE. Discussion ensued. 
 
Mr. Holloway asked about taking care of staff morale. Gabriella Caldwell-Miller described numerous 
activities teams have created to support one another.  
 
Ms. Sager reminded the Board  this is typically the time of year the County recognizes employees for their 
years of service during a special event; considering social distancing, staff is looking at other ways for 
recognition. 
 
Melissa Young inquired as to the use of Zoom for telehealth. Ms. Sager responded that meetings are 
password protected and/or entry is controlled by the meeting organizer. In addition, the CSB is using the 
HIPAA-compliant Zoom platform.

Ms. Spain asked about the County Administrator’s retirement party. Jim Taylor responded County 
Administration is  looking to plan something that meets current social gathering restrictions. It was further 
clarified that Mr. Harris’s retirement date has been extended to June. 
 
Ms. Sager spoke to the 3Prd
P quarter financial report, considering the impact of the virus on the agency’s 
financial picture. As such, a financial update regarding both the current year budget and next year’s budget 
will be provided at the June meeting. 
 
Ms. Sager described how the CARF Recertification Survey will be completed digitally. 
 
Mr. Holloway asked about the drop in SDA numbers for youth seeking mental health services. Dr. 
Caldwell-Miller spoke to several factors, including children coping better than expected without the 
stressors from school demands, and adults facing challenges seeking services while working from home 
and caring for children. 
 
Margaret Perkinson commented on the challenges preparing for CARF during all the changes in response 
to COVID-19 and her admiration of those doing so. 
 
Ms. Young asked about STEP VA funding, with Ms. Sager speaking to how it has been paused. Discussion 
ensued. 
 
Ms. Young inquired as to how COVID-19 will change things for the future, such as efficiencies. Ms. Sager 
responded that there have been many “silver linings” around removing service barriers, but as the agency 
moves forward, staff will continue to serve in compliance with the regulations that govern the services 
provided. 
 
Ms. Perkinson offered there are still many areas of the County without internet service as well as clients 
without equipment to enable telehealth. Ms. Sager spoke to clients not having enough cell phone minutes 
for hour-long sessions and described workarounds and support from HCSS to acquire minutes for clients.  
Discussion ensued. 
 
Ms. Spain asked if the agency is taking temperatures of staff or members of the public upon entry to CSB 
buildings. Ms. Sager indicated temperatures were not being taken, and spoke to new employee health 
protocols, as did Mr. Taylor. Discussion ensued. 
 
Mr. Holloway paused discussion to welcome Ryan Hudson to the Board. Mr. Hudson was appointed in 
March and represents the Mechanicsville District. Mr. Hudson provided a brief description of his 
background and interest in mental health services. Board Members and staff introduced themselves and 
welcomed Mr. Hudson. 
 
Chairperson’s Report 
Mr. Holloway reviewed upcoming work sessions and discussed options for presentations to be made via 
video conferencing. 
 
Mr. Holloway announced the Public Awareness Committee presentation has been paused. 
 
Ms. Sager spoke to the June Board Meeting, which typically includes a closed session related to her 
performance evaluation by the Board. Mr. Taylor confirmed evaluations for all County staff are moving 
forward even though there will be no merit-based pay increases. He indicated to Board members that he 
would be seeking their input on the Executive Director’s performance ahead of June’s meeting.

Board Member Updates and Activities 
Amy Gregory announced the Miss Hanover Abilities event is paused. Ms. Gregory also spoke to HCSS’s 
collaboration with the CSB in assisting clients access telehealth by providing phones and minutes. 
 
Mr. Holloway announced that the Arc of Hanover programs came to a standstill in March. He went on to 
say Arc was able to get a federal Paycheck Protection Plan loan and is connecting with clients as best it 
can, since the biggest challenge the clients face is isolation. Mr. Holloway also shared Arc’s advocacy 
for clients to receive COVID relief money. 
 
Ms. Gregory announced she has been working hard on teaching students in new ways and finally feels 
she has settled into it. 
 
Ms. Cross commented on the success of the RAFT Zoom groups. 
 
Ms. Sager invited the meeting’s attendees to share their thoughts on today’s meeting configuration, 
spacing, etc. as the team continues to look at the best ways to safety continue meeting. 
 
Ms. Spain asked about takeaways from the National Drug Abuse Summit. Ms. Sager announced that 
information will be shared with the local Opioid Taskforce.

Executive Director’s Monthly Report 
June 2020 
 
A. Executive Director 
 
• Ashland and Bell Creek offices open during regular business hours 
• DOJ Settlement Agreement Updates 
• Recent Audits 
• Hanover DASH Update 
 
With Hanover County’s phased reopening of County buildings, the Ashland and Bell Creek 
lobbies were reopened to walk-ins as of Monday, June 1. So far this week, traffic has been light 
but steady. As well, staff that have been working remotely (more than 50% of CSB staff) are 
beginning to transition back to their County workspace. At this time, the lobbies are open during 
normal business hours (evening hours have not yet resumed); clinical staff, however, continue to 
schedule evening telehealth appointments reflective of their pre-COVID schedules. Day program 
sites remain closed with no determination at this point when they will reopen. 
 
In the midst of the COVID response, the DOJ Settlement Agreement and actions that are 
necessary for Virginia to exit the agreement on time, remain a primary focus for DBHDS, and by 
extension, the CSBs. This includes substantial changes to the Performance Contract, data 
requirements and licensing reviews, just to name a few. VACSB continues to advocate on behalf 
of CSBs around these expectations, though little to no flexibility is being considered or offered. 
Hanover CSB will continue to work diligently to respond to the new and numerous requirements 
related to the DOJ Settlement Agreement. A work session to provide greater detail will be 
provided later this year.  
 
As related to the above, the agency has been under both a DMAS audit and licensing review in 
the last few weeks, both looking specifically at DD program areas. The licensing review was 
completed with one citation. The DMAS audit is in its final stages. 
 
Hanover DASH, the County’s transportation program that was launched in December 2019, has 
announced some program enhancements. Beginning June 12, the program is offering the 
following enhancements as a pilot program: 
• 
“No Co-Pay Period” – Hanover DASH is waiving the $6.00 trip fee on all trips requested 
and occurring between June 12 and September 30. 
• 
Expanded hours of operation: 6 AM to 6 PM Monday through Saturday 
• 
Employment Transportation is now an eligible Trip Type 
• 
Service Area now includes medical facilities at Stony Point 
 
With the availability of service for transportation, Hanover CSB staff are working with supported 
employment individuals to consider this resource as an option for rides to and from work. More 
information about this will be provided during the upcoming board meeting.

The following are included in this month’s packet 
• April 2020 Dashboard  
• 3-month Planning Calendar  
 
UAccess Redesign Project 
In May 2020, 60 individuals presented at the agency seeking services through SDA (none were 
duplications). Of the 60 individuals that started the SDA process, 55 individuals proceeded 
through to the Comprehensive Needs Assessment and were scheduled for an initial appointment 
with a primary clinician. The remaining 5 did not proceed through the process due to a variety of 
reasons, including being referred to another service provider (1) and self-selecting to not follow 
through with the complete process (4). There were no direct referrals to crisis from SDA in May. 
 
The chart below provides a visual of the primary service type for those who proceeded through 
assessment and were scheduled for their first appointment since the beginning of this fiscal year. 
 
U
 
 
UStep VA 
Due to impacts to the State budget, funding for additional steps in the Step VA plan have been 
unallotted. Hanover CSB expects for receive level funding in FY21 for the first three steps that 
were previously funded – Same Day Access, Primary Care and Outpatient Services. 
 
UHuman Resources 
In May, there was one new hire:  Part-time, non-benefited Peer Recovery Specialist.  There were 
no resignations. 
 
Staff continue to work on performance evaluations; all evaluations are to be completed and 
submitted to Human Resources by June 19, 2020.

While no in-person staff recognition event will be held this year, the agency is working to 
provide a recognition gift to all staff, especially in recognition for their commitment, flexibility 
and resiliency during the public health emergency. In addition, the County will continue their 
annual tradition of providing service awards, though no public ceremony will be held. This year, 
the CSB celebrates the service of staff as follows: 
5 years – 4 
15 years – 5  
20 years – 5 
25 years – 1 
30 years – 2 
 
         UDonationsU (*Donations that need action to accept by the Board.) 
• Compass Church donated office supplies benefiting all programs with an approximate 
value of $50.00. 
• Anonymous donors provided 46 fabric facemasks, available for clients participating 
in all programs, with an approximate value of $92.00. 
• Hanover Mental Health donated $2000.00 to the RAFT House Member Fund.* 
UCommunity Relations/Community Education

B. Business Operations 
• FY 2021 Department Budget 
• Facility Repairs and Maintenance 
• COVID-19 Facility Improvements 
UFY 2021 Department BudgetU  
CSB has received the final FY 2021 department budget; it is 3.66% higher than the FY 2020 
adopted department budget. More details will be provided during the upcoming meeting. 
 
37TUFacility Repairs and MaintenanceU  
37TAll CSB building improvements are on hold until next fiscal year. The Raft House parking lot 
improvements which are funded by the landlord (as included in the recent lease amendment) are 
on hold at this time waiting on the contractor to replace the building’s drain field for the septic 
system. Once, the new drain field is installed, the landlord will be able to move forward with 
paving the main parking area, and re-graveling the access roads. Expected completion is July 1, 
2020. 
 
37TUCOVID-19 Facility ImprovementsU  
37TDepartment staff worked with the County’s Facilities Department to have sneeze guards 
installed at the Ashland and Bell Creek lobbies. The sneeze guards have been strategically placed 
at greeter stations and front desk work stations to create a barrier between the client and staff 
when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Facilities has also put down distancing markers 
to give clients suggestions on where to stand while waiting in line to be screened and checked in.

• Housing Choice Voucher Program 
• Behavioral Health Wellness Team 
• Outpatient Services and Community Services 
 
UHousing Choice Voucher Program 
Virginia Housing and Development Association (VHDA) awarded a grant, COVID-19 
Emergency Funding Support: VHDA's Housing Choice Voucher Network, in the amount of 
$5,315.00. The purpose of the grant is to support efforts to maintain the capacity of the Housing 
Choice Voucher Program that is managed by HCCSB. The grant provides funding support for 
the part-time non-benefitted Housing Specialist Position. 
 
UBehavioral Health Wellness 
The BHW team continued to leverage social media to reach its audience in Hanover County and 
beyond. BHW served 4,988 people, served via social media (FB, YouTube, zoom), professional 
consultation, and email. A highlight in May was the Teens Care Too Quarantine Challenge and 
youth videos. The Teens Care Too Quarantine Challenge guide is included in this packet. The 
videos are available on the Hanover Cares YouTube page: 
33Thttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wgKWBrdTZiqv_7RFIi8Mw33T.  
 
UOutpatient Services and Community Services 
Staff continue to collaborate across programs to serve our clients during the COVID-19 
emergency. Three RAFT Case Managers continue to manage case management services for 
clients enrolled in the Adult Outpatient (OP) Program. The Adult OP team continues to use 
telehealth to make services accessible. Clinicians have noticed that some clients find they can 
share more easily when talking on the phone. However, some clients seem to have a more 
difficult time engaging via telehealth. Clinicians are responding by devoting additional time and 
adopting creative methods to engage these clients. Clinicians note that the no-show rate for 
sessions seems to be close to zero! 
 
True to the evidence-based mission for providing intensive services to individuals in the 
community, members of the Intensive Community Treatment program completed an intake 
interview at Carter Park in Ashland to best facilitate a homeless individual accessing services. 
This individual had come through SDA, been hospitalized, and became hard to locate upon 
hospital discharge. Additionally, the team met face to face with clients to deliver medications, 
provide injections, link individuals to medical care and groceries, and help individuals move 
from homelessness to apartment dwelling.  
 
Both RAFT House and ICT staff delivered meal kits to clients who needed food but lacked 
transportation to pick up the meal kits provided through the County.

USupport CoordinationU    
Supported Living Staff continued to provide drive by visits to several individuals. They also 
delivered meals to individuals who were not able to get to the Hanover Meal Distribution sites.  
Two staff who are THEROPS trainers were able to continue providing the first part of 
THEROPS for staff recertification and for new staff through Zoom. Staff have been working 
with families and individuals to complete 17 Slot Allocation Review Form assessments for an 
upcoming Waiver Slot Allocation Panel in June. Three Community Living slots and one Family 
and Individual Supports (FIS) slot will be awarded. These slots are available through attrition. 
Another Waiver Slot Allocation panel will be held later in the summer to allocate the FY21 slot 
that have been allocated. Preliminarily, Hanover anticipates 2 CL and 11 FIS waivers to be 
assigned at that time. Staff enjoyed working with Supported Employment staff to deliver 
approximately 40 “Bee Well” activity kits to individuals.   
 
USupported Employment 
SE staff are continuing to support clients who need unemployment benefits, Zoom SE support 
meetings and prepping to return to work for clients. Some clients in individual employment and 
crews have begun to phase in their work sites and Job Coaches are going with them. Many SE 
staff have been assembling and delivering Bee Well kits.   
 
UDay HealthU  
DHR staff (9 total) continue to be redeployed into other positions within the county while the 
program is closed. The remaining DHR staff continue to stay in regular contact with program 
participants during the closure of the program with updates and outreach/engagement by phone. 
Staff are even doing driveway visits to chat, read books or just wave from a distance. 
Approximately 216 activity packets have been dropped off at program participant’s houses over 
the past 8 weeks!
