Summary 
RCW 42.24 governs the process for audit and review of claims and payroll payments for the City.  RCW 42.24.180 
requires the review and approval of all payments at a regularly scheduled public meeting on at least a monthly 
basis.  The State Budgeting, Accounting and Reporting Systems (BARS) Manual outlines the above format for 
approval by the City Council.   
RCW 42.24.080 requires that all claims presented against the City by persons furnishing materials, rendering 
services, or performing labor must be certified by the appropriate official to ensure that the materials have 
been furnished, the services rendered, or the labor performed as described, and that the claims are just, due 
and unpaid obligations against the City. 
RCW 42.24.180 allows expedited processing of the payment of claims when certain conditions have been 
met. The statute allows the issuance of warrants or checks in payment of claims before the legislative body 
has acted to approve the claims when: (1) the appropriate officers have furnished official bonds; (2) the 
legislative body has adopted policies that implement effective internal control; (3) the legislative body has 
provided for review of the documentation supporting the claims within a month of issuance; and (4) that if 
claims are disapproved, they shall be recognized as receivables and diligently pursued. 
The City meets all these conditions. 
To comply with the requirements, Finance staff schedule payment of claims and payroll for semi-monthly 
Council approval on the Consent Agenda. The payments listed in the schedule cover all claims and payroll 
payments during the period prior to the date of the Council meeting. 
All payments made during this period were found to be valid claims against the City. Details are attached 
and any questions should be directed to the City Manager or Finance Director. 
The City’s internal controls include certification of the validity of all payments by the appropriate department 
prior to submission for payment. The Finance Director has delegated authority for the examination of 
vouchers and authorization of payments to the Finance, Accounts Payable, and Payroll staff. All payments 
are reviewed and validated. The Finance Division regularly reviews its processes to ensure appropriate 
internal controls are in place.

Staff Report Summary 
Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA) requires certain cities and counties to adopt 
and maintain a Comprehensive Plan which addresses specific mandated elements as prescribed 
by the Act. The Plan may be amended no more than once per year. The City of Moses Lake adopted 
a GMA-compliant Comprehensive Plan in 2001 and has amended it periodically since. 
Before adopting amendments to its Comprehensive Plan, the City must provide a 60-day review 
and comment period to state agencies. This 60-day review was completed for the 2019 
amendment process. Comprehensive Plan amendments are also subject to the requirements of 
the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). SEPA gives state agencies, local agencies, and the public 
an opportunity to comment on the potential impacts the proposal may have on the environment. 
The SEPA review was not completed on the 2019 Comprehensive Plan amendment proposals. For 
this reason, I am requesting City Council rescind Ordinance 2934 which adopted the 2019 
Comprehensive Plan amendments. 
The ordinance included two zone changes within the City, and two changes to the Urban Growth 
Area (UGA). The two requests to include property in the UGA were not forwarded to Grant County 
for review, as is required. The Central Terminals request to include 170 acres in the UGA, and the 
Dunes Lakes, LLC request to include 833 acres in the UGA are no longer viable. 
The Hansen request to change 8.54 acres from Public Zone to Light Industrial, and the Cox and Cox 
request to change 2.82 acres from High Density Residential to General Commercial are viable but 
subject to challenge because the SEPA review process was not followed correctly.

On December 19, 2019, the City Council approved the proposed Comprehensive Plan amendments
