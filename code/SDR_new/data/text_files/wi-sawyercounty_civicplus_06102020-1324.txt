county forests. An opinion of the Attorney General with reference to the Forest Crop Law 
stated that the counties would be exempt from the owner's share of annual tax. In 1929 the 
law was amended to create the County Forest Reserve Law. In 1963, several major revisions 
were made, creating the County Forest Law s28.11. The most notable change was the 
creation of a permanent program of forests that would be managed in accordance with a 10 
Year Comprehensive Land Use Plan developed by the county, with the assistance of the 
Department of Natural Resources. Several grants and loans were created and remain 
available to counties to compensate for public uses of these county forest lands as stipulated

in s28.11. To fulfill additional statutory obligations acreage share payments to towns are 
currently $.30/acre, and towns with county forest land receive a minimum of 10% of the 
stumpage revenue from their respective County Forest each year. 
In 2020, twenty-nine counties in Wisconsin owned approximately 2.4 million acres entered 
under the County Forest Law. 
125.2
SAWYER COUNTY FOREST HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
 
1932: A County resolution was adopted designating the County Forest reserve Units.  The 
units established were the Namekagon, Totogatic, Lake Chetac North, Lake Chetac South 
and the Thornapple Forest Reserve Units.  At the time, the County Conservation Committee 
was placed in charge of the administration of these lands.  They were also authorized to 
select some individuals to supervise activities on the Forest.  The first Administrator was 
given title of County Trespass Officer.  He was to be responsible to the Conservation 
Committee and to work in cooperation with the Wisconsin Conservation Department.
March 18, 1933:  The first application was made by Sawyer County to enter non-
agricultural County lands under the State Forest Crop Law and the County Forest Reserve 
Law.  These lands were to be designated by the Conservation Committee, Agricultural 
Committee and Tax Deed Lands Committee.
1932-1941:  An important development in the history of the Sawyer County Forest was the 
establishment of the Smith Lake Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Camp, located in 
Section 8, Township 42 North, Range 7 West.  This camp was started in 1932 and closed 
down in 1941.  The Federal CCC program employed young men who worked hard planting 
trees and improving the Forest and Forest infrastructure.  Among the accomplishments on 
the Sawyer County Forest were 4,688 acres of trees planted and 4,237 acres of timber stand 
improvements.  Other projects included white pine blister rust control, construction of fire 
towers, telephone lines, fire lands and firebreaks.

1933:   The total acreage of Sawyer County land entered under the Forest Crop Law was 
37,622 acres.
1934:  The first County Forest ordinance was adopted.
1937:  The first recorded County Forest withdrawals occurred.
1939:  Portions of Section 21, Township 42 North, Range 8 West were withdrawn for 
purposes of exchanging land to obtain flowage rights on the Totogatic Flowage.  Also, in 
1939, upon recommendation of the State and resolution of the County Board, County lands 
within the boundaries of the Flambeau River State Forest were traded for State lands within 
the boundaries of the Sawyer County Forest.  At this time, the Sawyer County Forest was in 
excess of 70,000 acres.
1941:  Starting about this time, lands that could be purchased for a reasonable price within 
the County Forest boundaries were acquired.  Among the lands acquired was the Hans 
Thompson property in Section 7, Township 42 North, Range 7 West.  These purchased 
lands, together with lands acquired through tax delinquency were entered under the Forest 
Crop Law.
1947:  A resolution was adopted that all fire lanes in Sawyer County maintained by the State 
be turned over to Sawyer County to be maintained and operated under the direction and 
supervision of the Sawyer County Conservation Committee.  Later, many of these roads 
were turned over to the individual Townships to be entered under the Town Road Systems.
1964:  The total acreage of the Sawyer County Forest was 113,079 acres.
1960’s:  First snowmobile trail was developed.
1973:  Johnson Timber chipping mill opens just outside hayward, increasing demand for 
nearly unmarketable aspen timber.
Page 18 of 44

1976:  The County receives a Federal grant to develop a skiing and hiking trail.  The trail 
eventually becomes known as the American Birkebeiner Trail.
1979:  Louisiana-Pacific wafer board plant constructed, greatly increasing demand for aspen 
timber resource.
1979:  American Birkebeiner Trail widened to present width.
1988:  First funded ATV trails developed.
1993:  First Chequamegon Area Mountain Bike Association (CAMBA) trail developed.
1993:  County Forest gross timber sale revenue reaches $255,586
2001:  County Forest gross timber sale revenue exceeds $1,000,000 for the first time with 
gross timber sale receipts of $1,072,162.
2005:  County Forest gross timber sale revenue exceeds $2,000,000 for the first time with 
gross timber sale receipts of $2,094,267.
2008:  Sawyer County completes land purchase of 1398 acres from Board of 
Commissioners of Public Lands, parcels located within the Edgewater and Totogatic Blocks 
of County Forest bring total acreage of sawyer County Forest to 115,197 acres.
2015:  County Forest gross timber sale revenue exceeds $3,000,000 with gross timber sale 
receipts of $3,247,738.
125.3   WISCONSIN COUNTY FORESTS ASSOCIATION
Sawyer County is a member of the Wisconsin County Forests Association, Inc. (WCFA). 
This Association was incorporated on May 15, 1968 under Chapter 181 of the Wisconsin 
Statutes, without stock and not for profit. The WCFA Board of Directors is composed of 
Commented [PTT13]:  Static Language, leave 
intact.
Page 19 of 44

fifteen delegates elected from County Forestry Committees who are members of the 
Association and two members at large.
WCFA provides a forum for consideration of issues and policy that are common to all of 
the county committees responsible for their respective County Forest programs, including 
those programs encompassed under s. 28.11 and chapter 77, Wis. Stats. WCFA also 
provides leadership and counsel to County Forest administrators and forestry committees 
through regular meetings and active committees on legislative and recreational issues. 
WCFA develops and implements a strategic plan. The organization’s mission statement is 
as follows:
Wisconsin County Forests Association provides leadership uniting the interests of 
the world’s largest county forest program while ensuring long term forest health 
and sustainability.
125.4   TRENDS
The values and uses of the Sawyer County Forest contribute significantly to fulfilling many 
of society's ecological and socioeconomic needs now and in the future. Changing trends will 
impact the values and uses of the Forest in coming years.

Wisconsin’s forests are naturally changing due to forest succession. Most of the 
County Forest acreage statewide is a result of regeneration or planting from the early 
to mid-1900’s.  Mid to late successional northern hardwood forests are replacing the 
early successional aspen-birch, oak and jack pine forests of the 1940’s through the 
1970’s. The aspen cover type is key habitat for many of the state’s premier game 
species including deer, ruffed grouse, snowshoe hare and woodcock. The county 
forest system currently has 15% of the State’s public land base and 24% of the aspen 
resource.  

Conflict over timber management practices will likely continue to increase as more 
individuals and groups demand greater involvement in forestry decisions. Practices 
such as clearcutting and even-aged management will continue to be controversial. 
Efforts to educate the public on the merits of these sound forest management 
techniques will continue. 
Commented [PTT14]:  Thse are general trends 
that likely reflect statewide issues.  Tailor 
as approporate to reflect your local 
recognized trends.
Page 20 of 44
12

Sawyer County may experience funding problems as municipalities are being 
required to provide more services with less money. Potential losses of revenue from 
decreased shared revenues and resistance to tax increases may make county timber 
revenues increasingly important to the finances of county governments. This is 
complicated by increasing public pressure to reduce timber harvests on county 
forests.  

Increasing knowledge about a wider variety of species and their habitat needs is 
leading to a growing list of threatened and endangered species. This could lead to 
improvements in managing the forest and mitigating impacts to these species. 
Mitigating measures have the potential to impede recreational and forest 
management activities. Refer to Chapter 800 (840) for specifics on this subject. 

Invasive exotic species pose an ever-increasing threat to the County Forest. Gypsy 
moth, Asian long-horned beetle, garlic mustard, buckthorn, honeysuckle have all 
gained a foothold in Wisconsin’s forests. Refer to Chapter 600 (610) for specifics on 
this subject.

The Forest is considered to be an outdoor classroom serving all age groups. It 
consists of diverse communities with a large variety of plant and animal life giving 
ample opportunity for study and observation.
125.5   PROTECTING THE PUBLIC RESOURCE
As stated in State Statute 28.11 (1), the county forest program enables and encourages 
“the planned development and management of the county forests for optimum production 
of forest products together with recreational opportunities, wildlife, watershed protection 
and stabilization of stream flow, giving full recognition to the concept of multiple-use to 
assure maximum public benefits to protect the public rights, interests and investments in 
such lands; and to compensate the counties for the public uses, benefits and privileges 
these lands provide; all in a manner which will provide a reasonable revenue to the 
towns in which such lands lie.”

(2) 
Variances. The 
LCC 
may, 
upon 
the request 
of 
an 
Applicant, 
authorize 
a 
variance 
from
the requirements 
of 
this Ordinance when, 
upon 
showing 
by 
the Applicant, 
unnecessary
hardship 
would 
result 
from 
literal 
enforcement 
of 
this 
Ordinance.
(a) 
A 
variance 
shall:
1. 
Be 
consistent 
with 
the 
spirit 
and 
purpose 
of 
this 
Ordinance.
2. 
Be 
based 
on 
unique 
circumstances 
and 
not 
to 
the 
general 
conditions 
of 
the
area.
3. 
Not 
be 
granted 
for 
a 
self-created 
hardship.
4. 
Not 
permit 
an 
activity or 
practice that may 
fail structurally or 
otherwise
and 
cause 
significant 
Water 
Pollution 
or 
other 
off-site 
impacts.
5. 
Not 
be 
granted 
if 
the 
variance 
will 
result 
in 
an 
outcome 
that 
is 
contrary 
to
the 
public 
interest 
and 
be 
damaging 
to 
the 
rights 
of 
other 
persons.
6. 
Not 
be 
granted 
solely 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
economic 
gain 
or 
loss.
7. 
Not 
be 
granted 
solely

date 
of 
the 
Ordinance.
(b) 
No 
variance 
from 
the

be 
approved unless

variance or 
waiver 
from 
the Technical Standards 
through the
NRCS 
or 
other 
authorized 
authority. If

a
program 
requirement 
at 
the 
County's 
discretion.
(c) 
No 
variance from any State of 
Wisconsin code or standard may
