Unclaimed Payments shall be segregated in a special account and held in 
trust, uninvested by the Paying Agent/Registrar, for the account of the Owner of the

applied to the next payment or payments on the Certificates thereafter coming due 
and, to the extent any such money remains after the retirement of all outstanding

neither the City, the Paying Agent/Registrar nor any other person shall be liable or 
responsible to any holders of such Certificates for any further payment of such 
unclaimed moneys or on account of any such Certificates, subject to Title 6, Texas 
Property Code. 
Section 3.4. 
Execution and Registration of Certificates. 
(a) 
The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the City by the Mayor or 
Mayor Pro Tem and the City Clerk, by their manual or facsimile signatures, and the 
official seal of the City shall be impressed or placed in facsimile thereon.  Such facsimile 
signatures on the Certificates shall have the same effect as if each of the Certificates 
had been signed manually and in person by each of said officers, and such facsimile seal 
on the Certificates shall have the same effect as if the official seal of the City had been 
manually impressed upon each of the Certificates. 
(b) 
In the event that any officer of the City whose manual or facsimile 
signature appears on the Certificates ceases to be such officer before the authentication 
of such Certificates or before the delivery thereof, such manual or facsimile signature 
nevertheless shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such officer had remained 
in such office. 
(c) 
Except as provided below, no Certificate shall be valid or obligatory for 
any purpose or be entitled to any security or benefit of this Ordinance unless and until 
there appears thereon the Certificate of Paying Agent/Registrar substantially in the 
form provided herein, duly authenticated by manual execution by an officer or duly 
authorized signatory of the Paying Agent/Registrar.  It shall not be required that the 
same officer or authorized signatory of the Paying Agent/Registrar sign the Certificate 
of Paying Agent/Registrar on all of the Certificates.  In lieu of the executed Certificate 
of Paying Agent/Registrar described above, the Initial Certificate delivered at the 
Closing Date shall have attached thereto the Comptroller’s Registration Certificate 
substantially in the form provided herein, manually executed by the Comptroller of 
Public Accounts of the State, or by his duly authorized agent, which certificate shall be 
evidence that the Initial Certificate has been duly approved by the Attorney General of 
the State and that it is a valid and binding obligation of the City, and has been registered 
by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State. 
(d) 
On the Closing Date, one initial Certificate (the “Initial Certificate”), 
representing the entire principal amount of the Certificates, payable in stated 
installments to the Underwriter or its designee, executed by manual or facsimile 
-10- 
#6125310.5 
signature of the Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem and the City Clerk of the City, approved by 
the Attorney General of Texas, and registered and manually signed by the Comptroller 
of Public Accounts of the State of Texas, will be delivered to the Underwriter or its 
designee.  Upon payment for the Initial Certificate, the Paying Agent/Registrar shall 
cancel such Initial Certificate and deliver to DTC on behalf of the Underwriter registered 
definitive Certificates as described in Section 3.9. To the extent the Paying 
Agent/Registrar is eligible to participate in DTC’s FAST System, as evidenced by an 
agreement between the Paying Agent/Registrar and DTC, the Paying Agent/Registrar 
shall hold the definitive Bonds in safekeeping for DTC. 
Section 3.5. 
Ownership. 
(a) 
The City, the Paying Agent/Registrar and any other person may treat the 
Owner as the absolute owner of such Certificate for the purpose of making and receiving 
payment of the principal thereof, for the purpose of making and receiving payment of 
the interest thereon (subject to the provisions herein that the interest is to be paid to 
the person in whose name the Certificate is registered on the Record Date or Special 
Record Date, as applicable), and for all other purposes, whether or not such Certificate 
is overdue, and neither the City nor the Paying Agent/Registrar shall be bound by any 
notice or knowledge to the contrary. 
(b) 
All payments made to the Owner of a Certificate shall be valid and 
effectual and shall discharge the liability of the City and the Paying Agent/Registrar 
upon such Certificate to the extent of the sums paid. 
Section 3.6. 
Registration, Transfer, and Exchange. 
(a) 
So long as any Certificates remain outstanding, the City shall cause the 
Paying Agent/Registrar to keep at its Designated Payment/Transfer Office a register 
(the “Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, 
the Paying Agent/Registrar shall provide for the registration and transfer of Certificates 
in accordance with this Ordinance. 
(b) 
The ownership of a Certificate may be transferred only upon the 
presentation and surrender of the Certificate to the Paying Agent/Registrar at the 
Designated Payment/Transfer Office with such endorsement or other instrument of 
transfer and assignment as is acceptable to the Paying Agent/Registrar.  No transfer of 
any Certificate shall be effective until entered in the Register. 
(c) 
The Certificates shall be exchangeable upon the presentation and 
surrender thereof at the Designated Payment/Transfer Office for a Certificate or 
Certificates of the same maturity and interest rate and in any denomination or 
denominations of any integral multiple of $5,000, and in an aggregate principal amount 
equal to the unpaid principal amount of the Certificates presented for exchange.  
(d) 
The Paying Agent/Registrar is hereby authorized to authenticate and 
deliver Certificates transferred or exchanged in accordance with this Section.  A new 
-11- 
#6125310.5 
Certificate or Certificates will be delivered by the Paying Agent/Registrar, in lieu of the 
Certificate being transferred or exchanged, at the Designated Payment/Transfer Office, 
or sent by United States mail, first class, postage prepaid, to the Owner or his designee.  
Each Certificate delivered by the Paying Agent/Registrar in accordance with this Section 
shall constitute an original contractual obligation of the City and shall be entitled to 
the benefits and security of this Ordinance to the same extent as the Certificate or 
Certificates in lieu of which such Certificate is delivered. 
(e) 
No service charge shall be made to the Owner for the initial registration, 
subsequent transfer, or exchange for a different denomination of any of the 
Certificates.  The Paying Agent/Registrar, however, may require the Owner to pay a 
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that is authorized to be 
imposed in connection with the registration, transfer, or exchange of a Certificate. 
(f) 
Neither the City nor the Paying Agent/Registrar shall be required to 
transfer or exchange any Certificate called for redemption, in whole or in part, within 
45 days prior to the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, such limitation shall 
not be applicable to an exchange by the Owner of the uncalled balance of a Certificate. 
Section 3.7. 
Cancellation. 
All Certificates paid or redeemed before scheduled maturity in accordance with 
this Ordinance, and all Certificates in lieu of which exchange Certificates or 
replacement Certificates are authenticated and delivered in accordance with this 
Ordinance, shall be cancelled and proper records made regarding such payment, 
redemption, exchange, or replacement.  The Paying Agent/Registrar shall dispose of 
such cancelled Certificates in the manner required by the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended. 
Section 3.8. 
Replacement Certificates. 
(a) 
Upon the presentation and surrender to the Paying Agent/Registrar of a 
mutilated Certificate, the Paying Agent/Registrar shall authenticate and deliver in 
exchange therefor a replacement Certificate of like tenor and principal amount, bearing 
a number not contemporaneously outstanding.  The City or the Paying Agent/Registrar 
may require the Owner of such Certificate to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or 
other governmental charge that is authorized to be imposed in connection therewith 
and any other expenses connected therewith. 
(b) 
In the event that any Certificate is lost, apparently destroyed or 
wrongfully taken, the Paying Agent/Registrar, pursuant to the applicable laws of the 
State and in the absence of notice or knowledge that such Certificate has been acquired 
by a bona fide purchaser, shall authenticate and deliver a replacement Certificate of 
like tenor and principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, 
provided that the Owner first complies with the following requirements: 
-12- 
#6125310.5 
(i) 
furnishes to the Paying Agent/Registrar satisfactory evidence of his 
or her ownership of and the circumstances of the loss, destruction, or theft of 
such Certificate; 
(ii) 
furnishes such security or indemnity as may be required by the 
Paying Agent/Registrar to save it and the City harmless; 
(iii) 
pays all expenses and charges in connection therewith, including, 
but not limited to, printing costs, legal fees, fees of the Paying Agent/Registrar, 
and any tax or other governmental charge that is authorized to be imposed; and 
(iv) 
satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the City 
and the Paying Agent/Registrar. 
(c) 
If, after the delivery of such replacement Certificate, a bona fide 
purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which such replacement Certificate was 
issued presents for payment such original Certificate, the City and the Paying 
Agent/Registrar shall be entitled to recover such replacement Certificate from the 
person to whom it was delivered or any person taking therefrom, except a bona fide 
purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided 
therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost, or expense incurred by the City or the 
Paying Agent/Registrar in connection therewith. 
(d) 
In the event that any such mutilated, lost, apparently destroyed, or 
wrongfully taken Certificate has become or is about to become due and payable, the 
Paying Agent/Registrar, in its discretion, instead of issuing a replacement Certificate, 
may pay such Certificate when it becomes due and payable. 
(e) 
Each replacement Certificate delivered in accordance with this Section 
shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the City and shall be 
entitled to the benefits and security of this Ordinance to the same extent as the 
Certificate or Certificates in lieu of which such replacement Certificate is delivered. 
Section 3.9. 
Book-Entry-Only System. 
(a) 
The definitive Certificates shall be initially issued in the form of a 
separate single fully registered Certificate for each maturity.  Upon initial issuance, the 
ownership of each such Certificate shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as 
nominee of DTC, and except as provided in Section 3.10 hereof, all of the outstanding 
Certificates shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. 
(b) 
With respect to Certificates registered in the name of Cede & Co., as 
nominee of DTC, the City and the Paying Agent/Registrar shall have no responsibility or 
obligation to any DTC Participant or to any person on behalf of whom such a DTC 
Participant holds an interest in the Certificates, except as provided in this Ordinance.  
Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, the City and the Paying 
Agent/Registrar shall have no responsibility or obligation with respect to (i) the 
-13- 
#6125310.5 
accuracy of the records of DTC, Cede & Co. or any DTC Participant with respect to any 
ownership interest in the Certificates, (ii) the delivery to any DTC Participant or any 
other person, other than an Owner, as shown on the Register, of any notice with respect 
to the Certificates, including any notice of redemption, or (iii) the payment to any DTC 
Participant or any other person, other than an Owner, as shown in the Register of any 
amount with respect to principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Certificates.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance to the contrary, the City and the 
Paying Agent/Registrar shall be entitled to treat and consider the person in whose name 
each Certificate is registered in the Register as the absolute Owner of such Certificate 
for the purpose of payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 
Certificates, for the purpose of giving notices of redemption and other matters with 
respect to such Certificate, for the purpose of registering transfer with respect to such 
Certificate, and for all other purposes whatsoever.  The Paying Agent/Registrar shall 
pay all principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Certificates only to or upon 
the order of the respective Owners, as shown in the Register as provided in this 
Ordinance, or their respective attorneys duly authorized in writing, and all such 
payments shall be valid and effective to fully satisfy and discharge the City’s obligations 
with respect to payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 
Certificates to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.  No person other than an Owner, 
as shown in the Register, shall receive a certificate evidencing the obligation of the City 
to make payments of amounts due pursuant to this Ordinance.  Upon delivery by DTC to 
the Paying Agent/Registrar of written notice to the effect that DTC has determined to 
substitute a new nominee in place of Cede & Co., and subject to the provisions in this 
Ordinance with respect to interest checks or drafts being mailed to the registered 
Owner at the close of business on the Record Date, the word “Cede & Co.” in this 
Ordinance shall refer to such new nominee of DTC. 
(c) 
The Representation Letter previously executed and delivered by the City, 
and applicable to the City’s obligations delivered in book entry only form to DTC as 
securities depository, is hereby ratified and approved for the Certificates. 
Section 3.10. Successor Securities Depository; Transfer Outside Book-Entry-Only 
System. 
In the event that the City determines that it is in the best interest of the City 
and the beneficial owners of the Certificates that they be able to obtain certificated 
Certificates, or in the event DTC discontinues the services described herein, the City 
shall (i) appoint a successor securities depository, qualified to act as such under 
Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, notify DTC and 
DTC Participants of the appointment of such successor securities depository and 
transfer one or more separate Certificates to such successor securities depository; or 
(ii) notify DTC and DTC Participants of the availability through DTC of certificated 
Certificates and cause the Paying Agent/Registrar to transfer one or more separate 
registered Certificates to DTC Participants having Certificates credited to their DTC 
accounts.  In such event, the Certificates shall no longer be restricted to being 
registered in the Register in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, but may be 
-14- 
#6125310.5 
registered in the name of the successor securities depository, or its nominee, or in 
whatever name or names Owners transferring or exchanging Certificates shall 
designate, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
Section 3.11. Payments to Cede & Co. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance to the contrary, so long as 
the Certificates are registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, all 
payments with respect to principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such 
Certificates, and all notices with respect to such Certificates shall be made and given, 
respectively, in the manner provided in the Representation Letter of the City to DTC.

Section 4.7. 
Effect of Redemption.

When Certificates have been called for redemption in whole or in part and 
due provision has been made to redeem same as herein provided, the Certificates or

year of twelve 30-day months, such interest to be paid semiannually on February 1 and

The principal of this Certificate shall be payable without exchange or collection 
charges in lawful money of the United States of America upon presentation and

Certificate, the registered owner shall be the person in whose name this Certificate is 
registered at the close of business on the “Record Date,” which shall be the fifteenth 
day of the month next preceding such interest payment date.  In the event of a

new record date for such interest payment (a “Special Record Date”) will be established 
by the Paying Agent/Registrar, if and when funds for the payment of such interest have 
been received from the City.  Notice of the Special Record Date and of the special 
payment date of the past due interest (the “Special Payment Date,” which date shall 
be 15 days after the Special Record Date) shall be sent at least five business days prior 
to the Special Record Date by United States mail, first class, postage prepaid, to the 
address of each owner of a Certificate appearing on the books of the Paying 
Agent/Registrar at the close of business on the last day next preceding the date of 
mailing of such notice. 
If the date for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Certificate is 
not a Business Day, the date for such payment shall be the next succeeding day which 
is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, or day on which banking institutions in the 
State of Texas or the city in which the Designated Payment/Transfer Office of the 
Paying Agent/Registrar is located are generally authorized or obligated by law or 
executive order to close (a “Business Day”), and payment on such date shall for all 
purposes be deemed to have been made on the original date payment was due. 
This Certificate is dated June 15, 2020 and is one of a series of fully registered 
certificates specified in the title hereof issued in the aggregate principal amount of 
[$____________] (herein referred to as the “Certificates”), issued pursuant to a certain 
ordinance of the City (the “Ordinance”) for the costs associated with the rehabilitation 
of, construction of improvements to, and the equipment of the City’s System, including 
lift stations, elevated storage tanks, wastewater treatment plant head works, and the 
expansion of the wastewater treatment plant;  the construction of improvements to 
roads and related rights of way, including lighting, signals, signage, drainage, and 
landscaping; the cost of professional services incurred in connection therewith; and the 
costs of issuing the Certificates. 
 
The City has reserved the right to redeem the Certificates maturing on and after 
February 1, 2027, in whole or from time to time in part before their respective 
scheduled maturity dates, on February 1, 2026, or on any date thereafter, at a 
redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the 
date of redemption.  If less than all of the Certificates are to be redeemed, the City 
shall determine the maturity or maturities and the amounts thereof to be redeemed 
-22- 
#6125310.5 
and shall direct the Paying Agent/Registrar to call by lot the Certificates, or portions 
thereof, within such maturity and in such principal amounts, for redemption. 
[Certificates maturing on February 1, 20__, (the “Term Certificates”) are subject 
to mandatory sinking fund redemption prior to their scheduled maturity, and will be 
redeemed by the City, in part at a redemption price equal to the principal amount 
thereof, without premium, plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the dates 
and in the principal amounts shown in the following schedule:

February 1, 20__
$_______

The Paying Agent/Registrar will select by lot or by any other customary method 
that results in a random selection the specific Term Certificates (or with respect to 
Term Certificates having a denomination in excess of $5,000, each $5,000 portion 
thereof) to be redeemed by mandatory redemption.  The principal amount of Term 
Certificates required to be redeemed on any redemption date pursuant to the foregoing 
mandatory sinking fund redemption provisions hereof shall be reduced, at the option of 
the City, by the principal amount of any Term Certificates which, at least 45 days prior 
to the mandatory sinking fund redemption date (i) shall have been acquired by the City 
and delivered to the Paying Agent/Registrar for cancellation, or (ii) shall have been 
redeemed pursuant to the optional redemption provisions hereof and not previously 
credited to a mandatory sinking fund redemption.] 
Not less than 30 days prior to a redemption date for the Certificates, the City 
shall cause a notice of redemption to be sent by United States mail, first class, postage 
prepaid, to the Owners of the Certificates to be redeemed at the address of the Owner 
appearing on the registration books of the Paying Agent/Registrar at the close of 
business on the business day next preceding the date of mailing such notice. 
The City reserves the right to give notice of its election or direction to redeem 
Certificates pursuant to an optional redemption conditioned upon the occurrence of 
subsequent events.  Such notice may state (i) that the redemption is conditioned upon 
the deposit of moneys and/or authorized securities, in an amount equal to the amount 
necessary to effect the redemption, with the Paying Agent/Registrar, or such other 
entity as may be authorized by law, no later than the redemption date, or (ii) that the 
City retains the right to rescind such notice at any time on or prior to the scheduled 
redemption date if the City delivers a certificate of the City to the Paying 
Agent/Registrar instructing the Paying Agent/Registrar to rescind the redemption 
notice and such notice and redemption shall be of no effect if such moneys and/or 
authorized securities are not so deposited or if the notice is rescinded.  The Paying 
Agent/Registrar shall give prompt notice of any such rescission of a conditional notice 
of redemption to the affected Owners.  Any Certificates subject to conditional 
-23- 
#6125310.5 
redemption and such redemption has been rescinded shall remain outstanding and the 
rescission of such redemption shall not constitute an event of default.  Further, in the 
case of a conditional redemption, the failure of the City to make moneys and or 
authorized securities available in part or in whole on or before the redemption date 
shall not constitute an event of default. 
Any notice so mailed shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, 
whether or not the registered owner receives such notice.  Notice having been so given 
and subject, in the case of an optional redemption, to any rights or conditions reserved 
by the City in the notice, the Certificates called for redemption shall become due and 
payable on the specified redemption date, and notwithstanding that any Certificate or 
portion thereof has not been surrendered for payment, interest on such Certificates or 
portions thereof shall cease to accrue. 
As provided in the Ordinance, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, 
this Certificate is transferable upon surrender of this Certificate for transfer at the 
designated office of the Paying Agent/Registrar with such endorsement or other 
evidence of transfer as is acceptable to the Paying Agent/Registrar; thereupon, one or 
more new fully registered Certificates of the same stated maturity, of authorized 
denominations, bearing the same rate of interest, and for the same aggregate principal 
amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. 
The City, the Paying Agent/Registrar, and any other person may treat the person 
in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for the purpose of 
receiving payment as herein provided (except interest shall be paid to the person in 
whose name this Certificate is registered on the Record Date) and for all other purposes, 
whether or not this Certificate be overdue, and neither the City nor the Paying 
Agent/Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.  
IT IS HEREBY certified, recited and covenanted that this Certificate has been 
duly and validly issued and delivered; that all acts, conditions and things required or 
proper to be performed, to exist and to be done precedent to or in the issuance and 
delivery of this Certificate have been performed, exist and have been done in 
accordance with law; and that annual ad valorem taxes, within the limits prescribed by 
law, sufficient to provide for the payment of the interest on and principal of this 
Certificate, as such interest comes due and such principal matures, have been levied 
and ordered to be levied against all taxable property in the City. 
IT IS FURTHER certified, recited and represented that the revenues to be derived 
from the operation of the City’s water, sewer and wastewater system, after the 
payment of all operation and maintenance expenses thereof (the “Net Revenues”), are 
pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Certificates in an amount 
not to exceed $1,000; provided, however, that such pledge is junior and subordinate in 
all respects to the pledge of the Net Revenues to the payment of all outstanding 
obligations of the City and any obligation of the City, whether authorized heretofore or 
hereafter, which the City designates as having a pledge senior to the pledge of the Net 
Revenues to the payment of the Certificates.  The City also reserves the right to issue, 
-24- 
#6125310.5 
for any lawful purpose at any time, in one or more installments, bonds, certificates of 
obligation and other obligations of any kind payable in whole or in part from the Net 
Revenues, secured by a pledge of the Net Revenues that may be prior and superior in 
right to, on a parity with, or junior and subordinate to the pledge of the Net Revenues 
securing the Certificates. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City has caused this Certificate to be executed by the 
manual or facsimile signature of the Mayor or Mayor Pro Tem of the City and

bonds” within the meaning of section 141 of the Code.  Furthermore, the City will not 
take a deliberate action (as defined in section 1.141-2(d)(3) of the Regulations) that

Continuing Compliance.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Ordinance, the City’s obligations under the federal tax covenants set forth above will 
survive the defeasance and discharge of the Certificates for as long as such matters are

All documents provided to the MSRB pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by 
identifying information as prescribed by the MSRB. 
Section 10.3. Limitations, Disclaimers and Amendments. 
(a) 
The City shall be obligated to observe and perform the covenants specified 
in this Article for so long as, but only for so long as, the City remains an “obligated 
person” with respect to the Certificates within the meaning of the Rule, except that 
the City in any event will give notice of any redemption calls and any defeasances that 
cause the City to be no longer an “obligated person.” 
(b) 
The provisions of this Article are for the sole benefit of the Owners and 
beneficial owners of the Certificates, and nothing in this Article, express or implied, 
shall give any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim hereunder to any 
other person.  The City undertakes to provide only the financial information, operating 
data, financial statements, and notices which it has expressly agreed to provide 
pursuant to this Article and does not hereby undertake to provide any other information 
that may be relevant or material to a complete presentation of the City’s financial 
results, condition, or prospects or hereby undertake to update any information provided 
in accordance with this Article or otherwise, except as expressly provided herein.  The 
-35- 
#6125310.5 
City does not make any representation or warranty concerning such information or its 
usefulness to a decision to invest in or sell Certificates at any future date. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE CITY BE LIABLE TO THE OWNER OR 
BENEFICIAL OWNER OF ANY CERTIFICATE OR ANY OTHER PERSON, IN CONTRACT OR 
TORT, FOR DAMAGES RESULTING IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM ANY BREACH BY THE CITY, 
WHETHER NEGLIGENT OR WITH OR WITHOUT FAULT ON ITS PART, OF ANY COVENANT 
SPECIFIED IN THIS ARTICLE, BUT EVERY RIGHT AND REMEDY OF ANY SUCH PERSON, IN 
CONTRACT OR TORT, FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF ANY SUCH BREACH SHALL BE LIMITED TO 
AN ACTION FOR MANDAMUS OR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. 
(c) 
No default by the City in observing or performing its obligations under this 
Article shall constitute a breach of or default under the Ordinance for purposes of any 
other provisions of this Ordinance. 
(d) 
Nothing in this Article is intended or shall act to disclaim, waive, or 
otherwise limit the duties of the City under federal and state securities laws. 
(e) 
The provisions of this Article may be amended by the City from time to 
time to adapt to changed circumstances that arise from a change in legal requirements, 
a change in law, or a change in the identity, nature, status, or type of operations of the 
City, but only if (i) the provisions of this Article, as so amended, would have permitted 
an underwriter to purchase or sell Certificates in the primary offering of the Certificates 
in compliance with the Rule, taking into account any amendments or interpretations of 
the Rule to the date of such amendment, as well as such changed circumstances, and 
(ii) either (A) the Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount (or any greater 
amount required by any other provisions of this Ordinance that authorizes such an 
amendment) of the outstanding Certificates consent to such amendment or (B) a person 
that is unaffiliated with the City (such as nationally recognized bond counsel) 
determines that such amendment will not materially impair the interests of the Owners 
and beneficial owners of the Certificates.  The provisions of this Article may also be 
amended from time to time or repealed by the City if the SEC amends or repeals the 
applicable provisions of the Rule or a court of final jurisdiction determines that such 
provisions are invalid, but only if and to the extent that reservation of the City’s right 
to do so would not prevent the underwriters of the initial public offering of the 
Certificates from lawfully purchasing or selling Certificates in such offering.  If the City 
so amends the provisions of this Article, it shall include with any amended financial 
information or operating data next provided in accordance with Section 10.1 an 
explanation, in narrative form, of the reasons for the amendment and of the impact of 
any change in the type of financial information or operating data so provided.
