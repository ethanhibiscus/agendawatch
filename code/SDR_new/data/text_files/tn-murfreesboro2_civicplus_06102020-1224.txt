Summary 
Amendment to add the appropriate automatic renewal language reflected in the 
invitation to bid.  
Recommendation 
Approve Amendment #3 to add appropriate contract renewal language.  
Background Information  
The City accepted the original bid from Twins Technology LLC to purchase and install 
security cameras at City Hall. On April 11, 2019, Council approved the contract with 
Twins Technology. The original invitation to bid (Section 4.8), provided for automatic 
one-year renewals up to five years. This provision was inadvertently left out of the 
contract. Under the terms of the contract, the agreement expired on April 10th of this 
year, which was not the intention of staff or the vendor. The proposed amendment 
modifies the contract to provide for the terms of the bid request as published and 
accepted. 
Fiscal Impacts 
None. The proposed amendment follows the bid form and assures the City secure 
competitive pricing for security cameras and equipment.

WHEREAS, the Contract entered into on April 11, 2019, did not contain the appropriate automatic 
renewal language reflected in the Invitation to Bid; and

The City reserves the right to reject any and all bids, to waive any irregularities in a bid, to make 
awards to more than one bidder, to accept any part or all of a bid, or to accept the bid (or bids) 
which, in the judgment of the governing body, is in the best interest of the City.  The City also 
reserves the right to make revisions to any quantity shown on the bid form dependent upon bid 
prices and available funding.  Prices bid on each item shall be firm regardless of the actual quantity 
of item(s) purchased.  
Withdrawal of Bid. 
No bidder may withdraw its bid for a period of ninety (90) calendar days after the date and time 
set for the opening of the responses. In the event the City awards a contract to a bidder and during

contract, the City reserves the right to terminate the contract and award the contract to the next 
best offer without being required to re-advertise the project. 
Cost of Response. 
The City will not be liable for any costs incurred by the bidders in preparing a response to this 
solicitation. Bidders will submit responses at their own risk and expense. The City makes no 
guarantee that any equipment or services will be purchased as a result of the solicitation and 
reserves the right to reject any and all responses.  All responses and their accompanying 
documentation will become the record of the City. 
Contract. 
The successful bidder’s response to this ITB shall be included as an addendum to the contract.  
Should any conflict or discrepancy arise between the ITB and the contract, the contract shall 
control. All bidders who are awarded contracts pursuant to this ITB agree to be bound by the 
terms and conditions set forth in the attached City Contract (Attachment A).  If the bidder objects 
to any contract terms or proposes any additional terms, such objections and terms must be set 
forth in the bid.  Rejection of any proposed City Contract terms may be a basis for rejection of the 
bid. 
Contract Termination. 
The City reserves the right to cancel the contract for the work without cost or penalty to the City 
if, in the City’s opinion, there is a failure at any time by the contractor to adequately perform the 
contract, or if there is any attempt to willfully impose upon the City a material or product or 
workmanship which is, in the opinion of the City, of an unacceptable quality.  Cancellation of the 
contract shall not impair any rights or claim of the City to damages for the breach of any covenants 
of the contract by the contractor.    
 
The contract awarded may be terminated upon any of, but not limited to, the following 
occurrences:  
 
a) bankruptcy or insolvency of the bidder or one or more of the bidder’s principal owners;  
b) unauthorized substitution of products other than those identified in the specifications or 
specifically approved by the City as a substitute prior to award of the contract;

bidder;

e) and any other breach of the terms of the ITB specifications or contract. 
Page 6 of 27 
 
Contract Modification. 
The contract may be modified only by written amendment executed by all parties and their 
signatories hereto.  
Replacement or Repair. 
No waiver of any provision of the contract shall affect the right of any party thereafter to enforce 
such provision or to exercise any right or remedy available to it in the event of any other default. 
The City, at its option and in lieu of immediate termination, may request the awarded bidder 
replace or repair any defective goods or correct performance by written notice to the contractor.  
In that event, the contractor shall take corrective action within the amount of time specified by 
the City in the written notice.  Exercise of this option shall not relieve the contractor of any liability 
to the City for damages for the breach of any covenants of the contract by the contractor. 
Expense of Legal Action. 
Awarded bidder agrees that, in the event either party deems it necessary to take legal action to 
enforce any provision of the contract, and in the event the City prevails, awarded bidder shall pay 
all expenses of such action including the City’s attorney fees and costs at all stages of the legal 
action. 
Governing Laws. 
The validity, construction and effect of the contract, and any and all extensions and/or 
modifications thereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee.   
Severability. 
Should any provision of the contract be declared to be invalid by any court of competent 
jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed and shall not affect the validity of the remaining 
provisions of the contract. Any action between the parties arising from this agreement shall be 
maintained in the courts of Rutherford County, Tennessee.  
Indemnification and Hold Harmless. 
Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the City, its officers, agents and employees from: i) 
any claims, damages, costs, and attorney fees for injuries or damages arising, in part or in whole, 
from the negligent or intentional acts or omission of awarded bidder, its officers, employees 
and/or agents, including its sub or independent contractors, in connection with the performance 
of this contract; and ii) any claims, damages, penalties, costs, and attorney’s fees arising from any 
failure of awarded bidder, its officers, employees and/or agents, including its sub or independent 
contractors, to observe applicable laws, including, but not limited to, labor laws and minimum 
wage laws.  Pursuant to Tennessee Attorney General Opinion 93-01, the City will not indemnify, 
defend or hold harmless in any fashion awarded contractor from any claims arising from any 
failure, regardless of any language in any attachment or other document that Contractor may 
provide.

shareholders, member, or partners has been convicted or plead guilty or nolo contender to any

arising from injuries or damages resulting from, in part or in whole, the negligent or 
 
intentional acts or omissions of contractor, its officers, employees and/or agents, 
 
including its subcontractors or independent contractors, in connection with the 
 
performance of this Agreement, and, Expenses arising from any failure of Contractor, its 
 
officers, employees and/or agents, including its subcontractors or independent 
 
contractors, to observe applicable laws, including, but not limited to, labor laws and 
 
minimum wage laws.  
b.          Pursuant to Tennessee Attorney General Opinion 93-01, the City will not indemnify,

may provide. 
c.          Copyright, Trademark, Service Mark, or Patent Infringement. 
I. 
Contractor, at its own expense, is entitled to and has the duty to defend any suit 
which may be brought against the City to the extent that it is based on a claim that 
the products or services furnished infringe a copyright, Trademark, Service Mark, or 
patent.  Contractor will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City against any 
award of damages and costs made against the City. The City will provide Contractor 
immediate notice in writing of the existence of such claim and full right and 
opportunity to conduct the defense thereof, together with all available information 
and reasonable cooperation, assistance and authority from the City in order to 
enable Contractor to do so. The City reserves the right to participate in the defense 
of any such action. Contractor has the right to enter into negotiations for and the 
right to effect settlement or compromise of any such action provided (i) any 
amounts due to effectuate fully the settlement are immediate due and payable and 
paid by Contractor; (ii) no cost or expense whatsoever accrues to the City at any 
 
time; and (iii) such settlement or compromise is binding upon the City upon approval 
by the Murfreesboro City Council.

Contractor's obligation to satisfy the final award, Contractor may at its option and 
expense: 
a. Procure for the City the right to continue using the products or services. 
b. Replace or modify the alleged infringing products or services with other 
equally suitable products or services that are satisfactory to the City, so that 
they become non-infringing. 
c. Remove the products or discontinue the services and cancel any future 
charges pertaining thereto; provided however, Contractor will not exercise 
this option until Contractor and the City have determined that each of the 
other options are impractical. 
III. 
Contractor has no liability to the City if any such infringement or claim thereof is 
based upon or arises out of the use of the products or services in combination with 
apparatus or devices not supplied or else approved by Contractor, the use of the 
products or services in a manner for which the products or services were neither 
designated nor contemplated, or the claimed infringement in which the City has any 
direct or indirect interest by license or otherwise, separate from that granted herein.

Local Option Sales Tax for FY 20 ran about 3.6% above FY 19 and about 1.4% above budget through April.  April 
collections came in over budget. This information reflects a 2-month lag – the collections are for February 2020 taxes. A 
drop is anticipated in this revenue line item beginning with the May receipts. 
 
 
 
State Sales Tax came in about 4.6% above budget and around 6.6% higher than last year through April. This is due to the 
new internet sales tax collections that are incorporated into the State Shared Sales Tax. The new internet sales tax rules 
went into effect in October and started appearing in the collections in December. This information reflects a 2-month lag 
– the collections are for February 2020 taxes. A significant drop is anticipated in this revenue line item beginning with 
the May receipts.

The Hotel/Motel Tax rate doubled in FY 20 from 2.5% to 5%. Thru March, collections were in-line with FY 19’s reported 
gross receipts. However, the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on the travel and tourism industry significantly impacted 
March taxes remitted in April. Collections were down 54% and are expected to continue to decline for the remainder of 
the fiscal year and into FY21. Projections for the remainder of the year are around 25-27% of what was budgeted, which 
will result in a projected $950,000 budget deficit for FY20. FY21 Hotel/Motel taxes are budgeted 50% less than FY20’s 
budget at $1.6 million.

The budgeted Debt Service Transfer increased by $1.4M to account for the additional debt service related to the 2019 
$58M SunTrust loan and anticipated debt service for FY20 debt of $25M. Debt Service is running 2.48% higher than this 
time last year which was anticipated due to the 2019 loan. Since the FY20 debt is no longer planned, budgeted savings 
are anticipated this year.  
 
Repairs & Maintenance make up 7% of General Fund budgeted expenses. This includes maintenance of software 
($1.1M), fleet services ($3.5M). Police R&M for radios, mobile data terminals, etc. totals $1.3M. State Street Aid R&M of 
streets, markings and right of way totals almost $4M. These expenses are seasonal and fluctuate depending on contract 
timing and timing of repairs. This was trending 19% under budget through April.

COUNCIL COMMUNICATION 
Meeting Date: 06/10/2020 
Item Title: 
Review of Solid Waste Ordinance Revisions 
Department: 
Solid Waste Department 
Presented by: 
Darren Gore  
Summary 
Recommended Solid Waste Ordinance revisions. 
Background Information  
The Solid Waste Department has undergone significant changes in the past year; 
gaining efficiencies and effectiveness in service delivery and maximizing resources. 
City Code Section 14 – Garbage, Weeds, Trash and Other Solid Waste needs to be 
amended to reflect current solid waste practices and better clarify to the public the 
expectations associated with curbside pick-up services for solid waste and brush, limb 
and yard waste.  All grass clippings recommended to be bagged in biodegradable 
yard waste bags year-round. Additional fees will be charged for loose grass clippings. 
Solid Waste Ordinance Revision Summary 
• 
All leaves recommended to be bagged in biodegradable yard waste bags from 
January 15th through October 15th.  Additional fees will be charged for loose 
leaves during this time period. During peak leaf disposal (Oct. 16th through 
January 14th), leaves may be loosely piled at the curbside for pickup.   
• 
Further clarification that private lawn and tree service establishments must not 
place the grass clippings or brush and limb at the curb for City pickup. 
• 
Incorporation of a Resolution to establish solid waste fees from time to time; 
establishing proposed fees for: 
o Monthly solid waste collection fees for residential and commercial 
customers, 
o Bulk item pick-up on a per item basis, 
o Brush, limb and yard waste collection for greater than 8 cubic yards 
(6’x6’x6’),  
o Payment for replacement of solid waste carts that are damaged, and  
o Fees for special event solid waste services, such as events on the square 
and Cannonsburgh. 
• 
Incorporation of Solid Waste Collection Design Criteria adopted July 10, 2019 
by City Council 
• 
Establishes discontinuation of service as defined in accordance with MWRD and 
CUD policies.

History 
Murfreesboro initiated a solid waste fee in January of 2019 at $5 per cart per month 
for both residential and commercial customers (commercial is defined as having 
multifamily and mobile home complexes included) for once a week and twice a week 
curbside pick-up, respectively.   
On July 1, 2019 the solid waste fees increased to $7.50 per cart per month for 
residential customers and $30 per cart per month for commercial customers.  The 
table below summarizes the cart counts (added and opted out) from July 2019 
through May 2020.

On July 10, 2019 the Council adopted solid waste collection design criteria that 
defined expectations of new residential development requirements that afforded 
them the opportunity to receive City solid waste curbside pickup services.  New 
commercial customers were no longer afforded City services for solid waste collection 
and disposal.  A “right-sizing” initiative was conducted on pre-existing commercial 
customers to allow them the opportunity to reduce the number of solid waste carts 
serviced by the City when they demonstrated on a recurring basis a lesser number 
of carts would satisfy their solid waste disposal needs.   
Existing practices involving brush, limb and yard waste pickup services were 
scrutinized and efficiencies have been gained through use of temporary “lay down” 
areas around town, utilization of other department resources, opening the mulching 
site on Florence Rd Saturday mornings, and significant overtime for personnel 
working additional hours to provide this service.   
On January 9, 2020, City Council approved an external contracted services contract 
with Rec Pro (Rollins Excavating) for curbside pickup services for brush, limb and 
yard waste.  The contract is for 1-yr with the option to extend 2 additional years in 
1-yr intervals.  In conjunction with this approval, was the sale of two 1-man knuckle 
3 
 
booms to Rollins.  The goal is to have twice a month pick-up of brush, limb and yard 
waste for the residents of Murfreesboro.  A significant amount of the proposed 
ordinance changes involves dealing with brush, limb and yard waste pickup.   
Setting proper service delivery expectations is of the utmost priority in making the 
proposed ordinance changes; however, enforcement of new City Code provisions will 
also be paramount in resetting some of the public behavior and substandard practices 
in solid waste and brush, limb and yard waste disposal.  
Council Priorities Served 
Responsible budgeting 
Affordable services with the goal of achieving long-term sustainability is the highest 
priority of the solid waste staff.   
Establish strong City brand 
Efficient and effective implementations of technology, training and retaining a 
resilient workforce translates into excellent customer service.  
Maintain public safety 
Proper collection, transport and disposal of solid waste is critical to maintaining the 
public health and welfare. 
Fiscal Impacts 
No immediate fiscal impacts associated with implementing the proposed ordinance 
changes. The proposed schedule of fees includes charging for bulk item pick-up, solid 
waste cart replacement, and special event service, which will enhance revenue and 
move the Solid Waste Department toward self-sufficiency.

Section 14-51 - Owner responsibility if property leased to tenant.  
The term "owner" used herein shall include any "tenant" (unless the real property is 
an apartment complex of five units or more) and this article shall apply to owners 
and tenants as follows:  
(A)  When the City Manager has prior knowledge that the subject real estate is 
rented or leased, or learns that same is rented or leased within ten days of the 
notice to the owner (as set forth in Code § 14-55), the City official shall also give 
notice to the tenant at the tenant's last known address. The notice to the tenant 
shall be in addition to the notice to the owner.  
(B)  If the owner proves that a written lease requires the tenant to maintain the 
premises and to perform the functions required by Code § 14-52 and Code § 14-
53, the primary responsibility hereunder shall be that of the tenant but with the 
owner having secondary responsibility. In the event the City is required to take 
the action set forth in Code § 14-57(A) and the tenant fails to pay the cost of same 
within 30 days of billing, the owner shall then be liable to the City for payment 
of same. Specifically, the owner will be subject to Code § 14-57(B) and Code § 14-
57(C). Nothing mentioned herein will affect the respective duty of the tenant and 
owner to the other. For the purpose of this article the term "written lease" means 
a lease agreement in writing signed by the owner and tenant.  
(Ord. No. 90-27 § 1, 06-07-90) 
Section 14-52 - Nuisance declared; penalty.  
(A)  Nuisance declared. It shall be unlawful for any owner to permit or suffer weeds 
to grow, or motor vehicles, rubbish, or garbage to accumulate, on the owner's 
property to such an extent that a nuisance is created which is injurious to the 
health, safety, or welfare of the inhabitants of the City. When premises in the 
City are not maintained in a sanitary condition as required by the laws of the 
State or the laws of the City, including specifically the International Property 
Maintenance Code and its provisions on weeds, motor vehicles, and rubbish and 
garbage, §§ 302.4, 302.8 and 305, respectively, and said premises have become a 
menace to public health, safety, or welfare, the City Manager shall declare the 
premises to be a nuisance. An adjudication of a violation of such a law by a court 
is not a prerequisite for the premises to be declared a nuisance in accordance with 
the terms of this article.  
(B)  Penalty. Failure to carry out this Code provision, and §§ 14-53 and 14-54 shall 
be considered a misdemeanor and subject to punishment as set forth in 
Murfreesboro City Code § 1-8.

used for this purpose, which map shall delineate specifically any areas so 
proposed which are within 50 feet of improved residential property, and the

The fee shall be the same as that established for variance requests. The Board of 
Zoning Appeals may grant special permit under Code § 14-120(B)(3) provided the 
evidence presented at the public hearing establishes the following:  
(1)  the requested use will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon 
the use and enjoyment of contiguous property and the character of the 
neighborhood;  
(2)  the facilities for keeping dogs will be constructed, arranged, and operated 
so as to be compatible with property in the immediate vicinity and not

Sections 14-123—14-200 - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - RECYCLING  
Section 14-201 - Recycle Murfreesboro.  
This article shall be known as the "Recycle Murfreesboro Ordinance".  
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-202 - Purposes.  
The purpose of the Recycle Murfreesboro Ordinance is to provide flexibility in 
developing and implementing recycling plans in the City, a means to protect our 
environment, a means to prolong the life of landfills, a means to preserve our natural 
resources, a means to prevent waste, and an alternative means of disposing of refuse.  
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-203 - Recyclables.  
The recycling program may include any or all of the following materials: clear, brown, 
and green glass; steel, tin and aluminum; paper plastic bottles; cardboard; newspaper 
or any other item approved by the Solid Waste Department Director. The term 
"recyclables," as hereinafter referred to in this chapter, shall include any item 
approved by the Solid Waste Department Director for collection as a commodity 
designated for reuse or delivery to an established recycling center, from all residences 
and establishments, public and private, but shall not include hazardous waste, 
infectious waste, commercial, industrial or residential solid waste, sewage, body 
wastes, recognizable industrial or medical by-products.  
 
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-204 - Authority.  
The City Manager is authorized and directed to cooperate with public and not-for-
profit organizations, corporations (private, for-profit), and individuals in developing 
recycling plans for the City, subject to the terms and provisions of this article. Any 
plan developed by the City Manager in cooperation with any public or private 
DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

SOLID WASTE 
 
 
Page 32 of 33 
 
organization, corporation, or individual shall be subject to the approval of the Council 
after a public hearing has been advertised a minimum of ten days in a local 
newspaper. Copies of the plan will be available at City Hall for inspection and review 
by the public for a minimum of ten days prior to the public hearing. The Council may 
alter or amend the plan following the public hearing. A plan may be approved by 
resolution. When applicable, all requirements for the grant of a franchise must be 
satisfied.  
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-205 - Dropoff centers.  
(A)  The recycling plan may involve drop-off centers. The dropoff centers plan may 
involve an exclusive franchise for a portion or all of the City. The plan may permit 
the use of City property (such as City schools or fire halls) for collections points. 
The plan may involve the City actually providing the collection containers. The 
plan may provide an exclusive franchise for all existing and new drop-off centers 
within the designated territory for a designated period of time. Any such plan 
must address the matter of cleanup, maintenance, publicity, and regular 
collection of recyclable materials. The plan should address the availability of a 
market for the recyclable materials collected.  
(B)  If there is no existing franchise, and there are two or more applicants for the 
same franchise, a not-for-profit organization will be favored over a for-profit 
organization or individual, all other things being equal. If a for-profit 
organization or individual has an existing franchise, then it will have priority 
over all other applicants for the same franchise, provided all other things are 
equal.  
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-206 - Curbside collection.  
The plan may involve curbside collection of recyclable materials. The plan may 
provide for a central collection point one day a month at one location in each block in 
the franchise territory. The plan may involve City equipment and employees actually 
picking up and hauling the recyclable materials to a central drop-off point. The plan 
may provide the exclusive rights to curbside pickup in the designated area of the City 
for a definite period of time. Before such a plan is implemented, proof of public 
acceptance and willingness to voluntarily participate in the plan for curbside pickup 
of recyclable materials must be demonstrated by the applicant. The factors set forth 
in Code § 14-205(A) in evaluating and reviewing plans and applicants are

(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-207 - Buy-back centers.  
Nothing in this article shall limit or prevent the establishment of commercial buy-
back centers. In other words, an exclusive grant of franchise under this article which 
involves voluntary recycling will not in any way impair, impede, or limit the ability 
of free enterprise to establish a buy-back center.  
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-208 - Anti theft and anti-scavenger provision.  
It shall be unlawful for any person to steal or to rummage through materials involved 
in a recycling program. It shall be unlawful for any person to steal materials or 
rummage through refuse, whether involved in a voluntary recycle program or not, 
when the refuse is placed at the curb for collection.  
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90) 
Section 14-209 - Non-recyclable material.  
It shall be unlawful for any person to deposit trash, refuse, garbage, or rubbish at a 
Recycle Murfreesboro collection point which is not a recyclable material designated 
for collection at the Recycle Murfreesboro collection point.  
(Ord. No. 90-13 § 1, 03-22-90)

Summary 
Reconsideration of staff recommendation to limit density to 2.5 single family unit 
equivalents in the following areas: 
• Flow monitoring basin 10A-3; area south of MTSU encompassing areas south of 
East Lytle St. to north of East Castle St. (exhibit attached).  Note that a portion 
of the area is within the City Core Overlay, which was exempt to any density 
restrictions per the Sewer Allocation Ordinance. 
• Flow monitoring basin 10A-4; area south of MTSU encompassing areas south of 
Alumni Dr. to north of John Bragg Hwy and north of University Ridge Apartments 
(Norman Ave.; exhibit attached). 
Staff Recommendation 
Restrict the development in Basins 10A-3 & 10A-4 to the density allowable for a 
Commercial Zoning at 2.5 single family units per acre (sfu/acre) or 650 gallons per 
day per acre (gpd/acre) regardless of the current zoning or whether the property 
resides within the City Core Overlay area.  
Developments “In Process” 
Two projects have been identified as “in process” by staff in basin 104-A.  They along 
with staff recommendation are as follows: 
1) East Side Village: Developer was told they would be required to have “low flow” 
developments, so they are fully aware of restricted flow conditions and will be 
subject to the 2.5 sfu’s per acre.  No grandfathering required.   
2) Karma is 23 units on 2.78 acres (8.3 units/ac).  This development was 
approved as a PRD by Planning Commission 1/24/18 and Construction plans 
were approved 7/22/19.  Water and sewer construction plans have not been 
approved.  This development meets the sewer allocation ordinance grand-
father period; however, staff recommends that if the project does not 
commence in the next six months that they would be required to pay 10% of 
their connection fees to secure 30 months of a will serve commitment for sewer 
service.

A due diligence meeting for a property located at 206 Dill Lane has been scheduled 
for a June 25, 2020 with Planning staff; however, I would not consider this “in 
progress” and therefore expect any development on this property to meet the 2.5 
sfu’s per acre density requirement.   
 
Background Information  
Between December 13, 2018 to January 21, 2019, the Department requested ADS, 
through our professional services agreement, to install 3 temporary sewer flow 
monitors within flow monitor Basin MF10 because a developer was interested in 
building a hotel just north of E. Main Street along Rutherford Blvd.  Staff was 
uncertain whether the downstream sewer main could handle the additional flow from 
a hotel.   
Between the dates of December 23 to December 31, 2018, Murfreesboro received a 
total of 3.24” with the heaviest rain during this period being December 31st of 1.91”.  
This rain produced sewer depths from 5” to 20” at the temporary monitor locations as 
shown on the attached spreadsheet.  With these depths of flow, the surcharge 
elevations can be determined within the sewer main and manholes up and/or 
downstream of the monitor locations.  As a result of these surcharge conditions, the 
Water Resources Department declined serving the proposed hotel and the project 
never coalesced.   
In 2011, upon receiving a Commissioners Order, from the State of Tennessee 
Department of Environment and Conservation staff created a Capacity Assurance 
Program (CAP) to explain the basis for coordinating capacity decision criteria for each 
sewer basin within our sewer system. The objective of the CAP was to enable the 
Department to authorize new sewer service connections or increases in flow from 
existing sewer service connections while not increasing the likelihood of creating 
sanitary sewer system overflows (SSO’s).  Within the CAP the below table of 
Collection System Surcharge Condition Criteria was created to give guidelines as to 
when to disallow additional connections to the system. 
 
Collection System Area/ Monitor 
Basin 
Surcharge Condition Criteria   
Area of Limited or No Backup  
Sewer Hydraulic Gradeline within 1’ of MH Rim  
Area of Significant Backup Complaints 
Sewer Hydraulic Gradeline within 2’ of MH Rim 
Siphon or Other Unique Structure 
Evaluate Based on Design Criteria 
 
Since the creation of this CAP, EPA Region 4 has created a little different guideline 
specified within different consent decrees given to municipalities within the southeast.  
The guideline is to disallow additional sewer connections and sewer extensions when 
 
3 
 
sewer surcharges within 3 feet of the manhole rim.  
Using this new surcharge guideline specified by EPA, and the recent flow monitoring 
study information, staff realizes the necessity to restrict development in the 
temporary flow monitor areas of 10A-3 and 10A-4.  The recently passed Sewer 
Allocation Ordinance and supporting Resolution has reduced the allowed densities 
based on the current zonings, except for the City Core Overlay area, however, staff 
feels the results of the flow monitoring warrant the need to restrict development 
densities even further in order to allow the vacant properties within these areas to 
continue to develop.  Instead of disallowing connections completely, staff would like 
CIA to study whether sewer flow can be redirected to Basin 9A and alleviate the 
density restriction. 
Council Priorities Served 
 
Maintain public safety 
Maintaining the Department’s NPDES Permit and safeguard the sewer system from 
sewer overflows focuses on public safety and welfare. 
Fiscal Impact  
Limiting the development density will reduce the sewer connection fees that the 
Department will collect.
