any party may request an opportunity to present additional evidence or testimony regarding the proposal. The review body 
shall grant such request by continuing the public hearing or by leaving the record open for additional written evidence or 
testimony. Failure to raise an issue during the hearing, in person or by letter, or failure to provide statements or evidence 
sufficient to afford the decision maker an opportunity to respond to the issue precludes an appeal based on that issue.
