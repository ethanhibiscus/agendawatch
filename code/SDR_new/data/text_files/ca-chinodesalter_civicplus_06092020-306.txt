Agenda Report 
JULY 2, 2020 
SECTION:  ACTION ITEM 
 
 
 
 
SUBJECT: 
ADOPTION OF REVISED CURRENT INVESTMENT POLICY 
RECOMMENDATION: 
It is recommended that the Board:  
1. Review the attached Chino Basin Desalter Authority Investment Policy, as submitted; and  
2. Adopt Resolution 20-xx approving CDA’s Investment Policy for FY 2020/21. 
BACKGROUND: 
The current Investment Policy retains the Board authorized investments, which are a subset of 
investments allowed by the updated California Government Code Section.   
The current Investment Policy states that the policy shall be reviewed whenever there are recommended 
changes or annually, whichever occurs first, and modifications must be approved by the Board of 
Directors. The Board’s last review of the Chino Basin Desalter Authority Investment Policy was at its 
regularly scheduled meeting on September 11, 2014. Since then, there have been no modifications to 
the current Investment Policy.  
Staff has made the following changes to the current policy: 
1. In Section 8.0 – Authorized and Suitable Investments, we have added Medium-term Notes 
under J. 
2. We have made minor verbiage changes as indicated by various red-lined areas. 
The revised Investment Policy is attached for the Board’s review. The primary objectives, in priority 
order, are: 
• Safety:  Preservation of capital in the overall portfolio is the foremost objective. 
• Liquidity:  Investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the Agency to meet 
all anticipated operating requirements. 
• Yield:  Return on investments is of secondary importance; however, the investment portfolio 
shall be designed to attain a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, 
taking into account the investment risk constraints and cash flow requirements. 
• Compliance:  At a minimum, an investment policy must comply with the requirements of the 
California Government Code (CGC).  The Board may impose additional requirements based on 
its investment objectives and preferences.    
• Comprehensiveness:  An investment policy should be comprehensive to ensure that the key 
aspects of the investment program are properly addressed.

• Balance:  An investment policy should provide a balance between investment restrictions, 
which help protect the Agency’s assets, and investment flexibility, which permits staff to adapt 
to changing market conditions and investment needs. 
• Clarity:  An investment policy should express the Board’s investment objectives with sufficient 
clarity, so that staff, brokers/dealers, and other interested participants clearly understand the 
investment policy’s intent.  
This item was reviewed and discussed by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on 6/9/2020 and 
reviewed/approved by the Finance Committee on 6/18/2020. 
PRIOR BOARD ACTION 
The Board of Directors approved and adopted the Chino Basin Desalter Authority Investment Policy 
on September 11, 2014. 
IMPACT ON BUDGET 
There is no impact on the Authority’s Fiscal Year 2019/2020 budget.

CDA Investment Policy (July 2014) 
 
Page  1 
CHINO BASIN DESALTER AUTHORITY 
INVESTMENT POLICY 
1.0 
POLICY 
WHEREAS; The Legislature of the State of California has declared that the deposit and investment 
of public funds by local officials and local agencies is an issue of statewide concern (California 
Government Code (CGC) Sections 53600.6 and 53630-1 (CGC §53600.6 and 53630.1);  
WHEREAS; the legislative body of a local agency may invest surplus monies, not required for the 
immediate necessities of the local agency, in accordance with the provisions of CGC §5922 and 
CGC §53601 et seq.; and 
WHEREAS; the Treasurer of the Chino Basic Desalter Authority (CDA) shall annually prepare and 
submit a statement of investment policy and such policy, and any changes thereto, shall be 
considered by the legislative body at a public meeting (CGC §53646[a]). 
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the policy of the CDA is to invest funds in a manner which 
will provide: (i) the maximum security; (ii) the funds necessary to meet the daily cash flow 
demands of the Authority; and (iii) the highest investment return while conforming to all statutes 
governing the investment of the Authority funds within the constraints of this Investment Policy. 
2.0 
SCOPE 
This Investment Policy applies to all surplus monies of the CDA.  
Pooling of funds 
Except for cash in certain restricted and special funds, the CDA will consolidate cash and reserve 
balances from all funds to maximize investments earnings and to increase efficiencies with regard 
to investment pricing, safekeeping and administration. Investment income will be allocated to 
the various funds based on their respective participation and in accordance with generally 
accepted practices. 
3.0 
PRUDENCE 
Investments shall be made with that degree of judgment and care, under circumstances then 
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management 
of their own affairs; not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of 
their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.  The standard of prudence to be used 
by designated investment signatories shall be the "prudent investor" standard (CGC §53600.3) 
and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Designated investment 
signatories, acting in accordance with written procedures, this investment policy, and exercising 
due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or 
market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion 
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 
CDA Investment Policy (July 2014)

4.0 
OBJECTIVES 
As specified in CGC §53600.5, when investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, 
selling, and managing public funds, the primary objectives, in priority order, of the investment 
activities shall be: 
A. 
Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program.  
Investments made by CDA shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation 
of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, diversification is required to prevent 
any potential loss on any individual security or depository from exceeding the income generated 
from the remainder of the portfolio. 
B. 
Liquidity: The investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable CDA to meet 
all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated. 
C. 
Return on Investments (Yield): The investment portfolio shall be designed with the 
objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking 
into account the investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.  
Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives 
described above.  The core of investments is limited to relatively low-risk securities in anticipation 
of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed.  Securities shall not be sold prior to 
maturity with the following exceptions:  
1. 
A security with declining credit may be sold to minimize loss of principal.  
2. 
A security swap would improve quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio.  
3. 
Liquidity needs of the portfolio that requires the security to be sold. 
5.0 
DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 
Authority to manage the investment program is derived from CGC §53600, et seq.  
Management’s responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated for a one-year 
period by the legislative body to the Treasurer or the General Manager/CEO who shall 
thereafter assume full responsibility for those transactions until the delegation of authority is 
revoked by the Board of Directors. The Treasurer shall establish written procedures for the 
operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Procedures should 
include reference to: safekeeping, wire transfer agreements, collateral/depository agreements 
and banking services contracts, as appropriate. Such procedures shall include explicit 
delegation of authority to persons/positions responsible for investment transactions. No person 
may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this 
investment policy and the procedures established by the Treasurer or the General 
Manager/CEO. The Treasurer shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall 
establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinates. 
 
 
CDA Investment Policy (July 2014)

6.0 
ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Officers and employees involved in the placement of investments shall refrain from personal 
business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment program, or 
which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. 
7.0 
AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND DEALERS 
The Treasurer shall maintain a list of approved and authorized financial institutions and brokers/ 
dealers, selected on the basis of credit-worthiness, financial strength, experience, and 
capitalization.   
In selecting the financial institutions for the deposit or investment of CDA funds, the Treasurer’s 
consideration shall include the depository’s latest equity/asset ratio data and continue to 
monitor the financial institutions' credit characteristics and financial history throughout the 
period during which CDA funds are deposited or invested. The minimum qualifications for 
Authority approved depository/financial institutions include: (i) that they must be at least three 
(3) years old; have total assets in excess of ten ($10) billion dollars; a core capital/asset ratio of 
5% or better; or (ii) have total assets in excess of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000); and 
a core capital/asset ratio of 6% or better. 
For the services of banks, savings banks, and savings and loan associations, depository 
agreements shall be prepared by the Treasurer and authorized representatives of the respective 
financial institutions for consideration and execution by the Treasurer.   
For broker/dealer services utilized to invest in government securities and other investments, the 
Treasurer is designated to select only broker/dealers who are licensed and in good standing with 
the California Department of Securities, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), or other applicable self-regulatory organizations. A 
periodic review of authorized broker/dealers is essential to serve the CDA’s investment needs. 
In order to improve quality services, expertise, and credit worthiness, the Treasurer may, on a 
selective basis, revise the approved list of broker/dealers to update qualified broker/dealers 
under the requirements of this Investment Policy.  
The Treasurer shall maintain a list of approved broker/dealers and will review the listing with the 
Board of Directors on an annual basis or more frequently if needed, (see Attachment  “D"). 
Financial institutions/depositories, broker/dealers and external investment managers, who do 
investment-related business with CDA shall sign a Certificate of Understanding (see Attachment 
"A"). The Certification of Understanding states that the entity: 
A. Has read and is familiar with the CDA’s Investment Policy as well as Applicable Federal 
and State Law; 
B. Agrees to notify CDA in writing of any potential conflicts of interest;   
C. Meets the requirements as outlined in this Policy; 
D. Agrees to make every reasonable effort to protect the assets of CDA from loss.

Annually, banks, savings bank, savings and loans associations, and authorized broker/dealers will 
be requested to update information about their financial institutions.  The required information 
will be supplied by responses to the attached questionnaires (see Attachment "B" for 
broker/dealers and Attachment “C” for banks and savings and loans), and provide CDA with 
copies of published financial statements. 
8.0 
AUTHORIZED AND SUITABLE INVESTMENTS 
CDA investments are governed by Government Code. Within the investments permitted by the 
Government Code, CDA seeks to further restrict eligible investments to the investments listed 
below. In the event an apparent discrepancy is found between this Investment policy and the 
Government Code, the more restrictive parameters will take precedence. Percentage holding 
limits listed in this section apply at the date a security is purchased. Credit ratings, where shown, 
specify the minimum credit rating category required at purchase without regard to +/- or 1,2,3 
modifiers, If any.   
A. United States Treasury notes, bonds, bills, or certificates of indebtedness, or those for 
which the full faith and credit of the United States are pledged for the payment of

accounts, time deposits, and certificates of deposit in financial institutions located in 
California. Bank deposits are required to be collateralized as specified under Government 
Code § 53630 et. seq.  Agreements allowing for the waiver of the collateral requirement 
for that amount of deposit covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may be 
implemented provided the remainder of the deposit is secured by collateral as required 
by the Government Code.  
D. Placement Service Certificates of Deposit (PSCD) with private sector entity that assists in 
the placement of deposit with eligible financial institutions located in the United States 
(CGC § 53601.8). The full amount of the principal and the interest that may be accrued

insurance. In combination with Negotiable CDs, the maximum portfolio exposure to 
Placement Service CDs is limited to 30%. The maximum investment maturity will be 
restricted to five years.  Total investment in this category should not go to one particular 
financial institution.

statute as an investment alternative for California’s local governments and special 
districts and is under the administration of the State Governor of California. All securities 
purchased by LAIF are under the  authority of Government Code § 16429 and 16480.4. As 
part of the Pooled   Money Investment Account (PMIA), LAIF has oversight by the Pooled 
Money Investment Board (PMIB), and an in-house Investment Committee.  LAIF also has 
oversight by the Local Agency Investment Advisory Board and is audited by the Bureau of 
State Audits on an annual basis.  Investment in California LAIF cannot exceed the

dealers with which CDA has entered into a master repurchase agreement which specifies 
terms and conditions of repurchase agreements. 
1) Transactions shall be limited to the primary dealers and banking institutions rated “A” 
or better by a NRSRO, or with a financially stable banking institution which CDA has 
substantial banking relationship.  The maturity of repurchase agreements shall not 
exceed 90 days. The market value of securities used as collateral for repurchase 
agreements shall be monitored daily by the Treasurer and will not be allowed to fall 
below 102% of the value of the repurchase agreement plus the value of collateral in 
excess of the value of the repurchase agreement. In order to conform with the Federal 
Bankruptcy Code which provides for the liquidation of securities held as collateral for 
repurchase agreements, the only securities acceptable as collateral shall be securities 
that are direct obligations of, or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest 
by the United States or any agency of the United States. 
 
CDA Investment Policy (July 2014) 
 
Page  6 
 
I. Negotiable Certificates of Deposit.  Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) issued by a 
nationally or state-chartered bank, a savings association or a federal association (as 
defined by Section 5102 of the Financial Code), a state or federal credit union, or by a

institutions which have long-term debt rated at least in the “A” category, or its equivalent, 
by a NRSRO; and/or have short-term debt rated at least “A-1,” or its equivalent, by a

I.J. Medium-Term Notes. All corporate and depository institution debt securities with a 
maximum remaining term of five years or less, issued by corporations organized and 
operating within the United States or by depository institutions licensed by the Untied 
State or any state and operating within the United States. Notes eligible for investment 
under this subdivision shall be rated “A” or better by a nationally recognized rating 
service. Purchases of medium-term notes shall not include other instruments authorized 
by this section and may not exceed 30 percent of the authority’s money that may be 
invested pursuant to this section. 
 
Ineligible Investments:  Investments not described herein, including but not limited to, reverse 
repurchase agreements and common stocks are prohibited from use in this portfolio. This 
Investment Policy further specifically disallows investments in inverse floaters, range notes, or 
interest-only strips that are derived from a pool of mortgages, or any security that could result in 
zero interest accrual if held to maturity. 
9.0 
AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS FOR BOND FUNDS 
Bond funds shall be invested in the securities permitted pursuant to Board approved bond 
documents. If the bond documents are silent as to the permitted investments, bond funds will 
be invested in the securities permitted by this policy. Notwithstanding the other provisions of 
this Investment Policy, the dollar portfolio, percentage, and term limitations listed elsewhere in 
the Investment Policy do not apply to bond funds. In addition to the securities listed in Section 
8.0 above, bond funds may be invested in a structured investment product if approved by the 
Treasurer. 
10.0 SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY 
As required by CGC §53601 all security transactions entered into by CDA shall be conducted on 
Deliver versus Payment basis. Delivery versus Payment or DVP basis means all securities 
purchased or acquired shall be delivered to CDA by book entry, physical delivery, or third-party 
custodial agreement. Investments in the state pool or money market funds are undeliverable, 
and therefore, not subject to the delivery or third-party safe keeping requirements. 
CDA Investment Policy (July 2014) 
 
Page  7 
 
11.0 DIVERSIFICATION 
The Board of Directors recognize that investment risks can result from issuer defaults, market 
price changes, or various technical complications leading to temporary illiquidity.  Portfolio 
diversification is employed to minimize these risks.  Investment signatories are expected to 
display prudence in the selection and/or approval of securities, to minimize the risks present in 
the investment portfolio.  No individual investment transaction shall be undertaken which 
jeopardizes the total capital position of the overall portfolio. Further, financial institutions which 
hold funds, deposited as investments, shall be subject to an investment limitation. 
 
The Board of Directors acknowledges that from time to time certain situations may arise during 
which strict adherence to an inflexible investment policy may be overly restrictive.  On a case by 
case basis, the Board of Directors may consider any pertinent information of such situations and 
may, by minute action, modify or waive, within the constraints of CGC §53601 et seq., any of the 
provisions and/or restrictions of this Investment Policy. 
The Treasurer shall periodically establish diversification guidelines, within the context of this 
policy, and strategies to control any risks of default, market price changes, and illiquidity. 
12.0 TRADING OF SECURITIES 
A trade is the movement from one security to another and may be done for a variety of reasons, 
such as to increase yield, lengthen or shorten maturities, to take a profit, or to increase 
investment quality. The purchase and sale transaction and the sale transaction must each be 
recorded separately and any losses or gains on the sale must be recorded. 
The Treasurer may obtain competitive bids from at least two brokers or financial institutions on 
all purchases of investment instruments primarily using “GFOA Yield Advantage” software when 
available.  Competitive bids can be also obtained by other communication channels when 
necessary. 
13.0 MAXIMUM MATURITIES 
Where no maturity limit is stated for an investment under Section 8.0, no investment shall be 
made in any security that at the time of the investment, has a term remaining to maturity in 
excess of five years unless the Board has granted express authority to make that investment 
either specifically or as part of a previous investment program no less than three (3) months prior 
to the investment. Any investment currently held at the time the investment policy is adopted 
which does not meet the new policy guidelines will be held until maturity and shall be exempt 
from the current policy.  At the time of the investment’s maturity or liquidation such funds shall 
be reinvested only as provided in the most current policy.   
14.0 PORTFOLIO DURATION LIMITATION 
The weighted average duration of the entire portfolio shall not exceed three (3) years. 
CDA Investment Policy (July 2014) 
 
Page  8 
 
15.0 MONITORING CREDIT RATINGS 
The Treasurer shall monitor the ratings of all investments in their portfolios on a continuous basis 
and report all credit downgrades of portfolio securities to the Board in writing within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event. If an existing investment’s rating drops below the minimum allowed for 
new investments made pursuant to this policy, the Treasurer shall also make a written 
recommendation to the Treasurer as to whether this security should be held or sold. 
16.0 REPORTING 
The Treasurer shall submit to each member of the Board of Directors a periodic investment 
report.  This report will include the elements of the quarterly report as recommended by CGC 
§53646, to include: 
a. 
Type of investment 
b. 
Name of institution 
c. 
Date of maturity 
d. 
Amount of deposit or cost of the security and the par value 
e. 
Current market value of all securities 
f. 
Rate of interest/earnings (yield) 
g. 
A monthly list of transactions  
 
(i) 
CGC §53646(b)(2),(3) recommends that the investment report must include a 
statement that (i) all investment actions executed since the last investment report 
have been made in full compliance with the Investment Policy or a Board of Directors' 
minute action (wavier) and, that (ii) CDA will meet its expenditure obligations for the 
next six months.  The Treasurer shall maintain a complete and timely record of all 
investment transactions in support of the above statement.  
17.0 INTERNAL CONTROLS 
The Treasurer is responsible for establishing and maintaining a control structure designed to 
ensure that the assets of CDA are protected from loss, theft or misuse.  The internal control 
structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met.  The 
concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that (1) the cost of a control should not exceed the 
benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation and benefits requires estimates and judgments 
by management.  
An annual independent review by an external auditor to assure compliance with policies and 
procedures will be performed as part of the Authority’s annual audit 
18.0 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 
The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of obtaining a rate of return 
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the investment risk constraints 
and the cash flow needs.  In order to determine whether market yields are being achieved, the 
Treasurer shall identify comparable benchmarks to the portfolio investment duration, (e.g. 90-
CDA Investment Policy (July 2014) 
 
Page  9 
 
day US Treasury Bill, 6-month US Treasury Bill, average LAIF yield rate).  This comparative analysis 
is included in investment report presented to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.   
19.0 POLICY REVIEW 
This investment policy shall be reviewed regularly to ensure its consistency with the overall 
objectives of preservation of principal, liquidity, and return and its relevance to current law and 
financial and economic trends. The Board shall be responsible for maintaining guidance over this 
investment policy to ensure that CDA can adapt readily to changing market conditions and 
approve any modification to the investment policy prior to implementation. 
20.0 STATE LAW 
The legislated authority of CDA’s investments is covered in Section 53601, 53607, 53635, 53638, 
53646, 53652, and 53653 of the Government Code.  It is the policy of CDA to comply with the 
State laws governing its investments. 
21.0 INVESTMENT POLICY ADOPTION 
The Investment Policy shall be adopted by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Chino Basin 
Desalter Authority. Moreover, the Policy shall be reviewed whenever there are recommended 
changes or annually, whichever occurs first, and modifications must be approved by the Board of 
Directors.

The price at which a security is currently being sold in the market.  See FAIR VALUE. 
 
MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT: 
A written contract covering all future transactions between the parties to repurchase agreements

A holder of securities (e.g. investment dealer) sells these securities to an investor (e.g. the 
Agency) with an agreement to repurchase them at a fixed date.  The security “buyer” (e.g. the 
Agency) in effect lends the “seller” money for the period of the agreement, and the terms of the 
agreement are structured to compensate the “buyer” for this.  Dealers use RP extensively to 
finance their positions. Exception: When the Fed is said to be doing RP, it is lending money that 
is increasing bank reserves.  
 
*REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT (REVERSE REPO): 
A counter party (e.g. investment dealer) buys the securities from the holder of securities (e.g. the 
Agency) with an agreement to sell them back at a fixed date.  The counter party in effect lends 
the seller (e.g. the Agency) money for the period of the agreement with terms of the agreement 
structured to compensate buyer.

sell) prices of a quote, or between the amount paid when bought and the amount received when 
sold.
