A. 
Program Launch Update 
 
Tyler Masters reported that WCE has launched now in all member jurisdictions, the Cities of Eastvale, Hemet, 
Jurupa Valley, Norco, Perris, and Wildomar.   The required two sets of pre-enrollment notifications for all 
jurisdictions have been mailed.  The first set of post-enrollment notifications were mailed to customers in the 
Cities of Norco, Perris, and Wildomar on April 13, 2020. 
 
Solar customers (Net Energy Metering – NEM) are the last remaining customer class to be phased-in and this 
will occur on a quarterly basis to coincide with Southern California Edison’s (SCE) 12-month true-up process.  
Post-launch, new customers will automatically be a customer of WCE; notifications are being delivered to new 
move-ins on a weekly basis. 
 
The regional opt-out rate is approximately 3.52%.  Most decline to state a reason for opting out; the next highest 
reason for this is because customers have indicated that they just do not like being enrolled automatically.   
 
Staff continue to monitor and respond to questions and comments within online public group pages; with the 
current social media tool being utilized, staff are unable to respond on public group pages.  Since the May 2020 
launch, social media activity has decreased substantially. 
 
Staff has posted a Frequently Asked Questions reference page on WCE’s website and will also post on WCE’s 
social media platforms. 
 
There was an error of the first set of customer bills – the charge descriptions were blank; however, the amount 
customers were charged was correct.  The error was made by SCE and has since been resolved. 
 
Action: 
1. 
Received and filed. 
 
 
B. 
Draft Fiscal Year 2020/2021 Agency Budget 
 
Andrew Ruiz reported that the draft Fiscal Year (FY) 2020/2021 Agency Budget continues to represent a 2% 
savings on customers’ bills overall.  There is an anticipated $12 million available for placement into the 
reserves.  WCE will launch its first program in the new fiscal year – the Smart Thermostat Program.  The 
Doubtful Account Reserve was increased from .5% to 1% in the anticipation of any COVID-19 impacts. 
 
Operating expenses and revenue may change due to updates of the load forecast following receipt of additional 
historical usage data from Southern California Edison (SCE), opt-out rates from the May 2020 enrollment 
2
becoming clearer, changes to both SCE and WCE rates that are expected to change five times in the upcoming 
fiscal year, and changes in market prices which impact the cost of energy.   
 
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has placed moratoriums on utility bill disconnections, which could potentially 
impact cashflows and non-payment, which is why WCE has increased its allowance for doubtful accounts.  
WCE will continue to regularly monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and adjust the Budget based on observed 
data and/or changes to underlying assumptions, if necessary, as the situation evolves. 
 
Craig Martin indicated that SCE has yet to provide historic usage data (HUD) data, which is crucial for the 
upcoming Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) so that WCE does not over procure for calendar year 2020.  Mr. 
Martin anticipates hearing from SCE within the next couple of days. 
 
Director Ted Hoffman asked if the payback to WRCOG is included in this fiscal year’s Budget. 
 
Mr. Ruiz responded that only current operational costs are included in this fiscal year’s Budget.  The debt owed 
to WRCOG will not be factored in until FY 2021/2022. 
 
Director Chris Barajas asked if WCE bought more energy than necessary due to the anticipated higher usage 
and will WCE be making a small profit. 
 
Mr. Martin responded that the months which have been over procured are June, July, August, and September; 
however, July prices will rise so it was best to purchase more than necessary when costs were lower. 
 
Director Barajas asked if, given the current pandemic, there is an increase or decrease to either customer and/or 
residential usage. 
 
Mr. Martin responded that there is a model to run for COVID-19 and it appears that residential usage may rise 
approximately 15%; commercial could also rise depending on the business being determined essential or not. 
 
Action: 
1. 
Received and filed. 
 
 
C. 
Non-Residential Client Engagement and Outreach Update 
 
Don Ries reported that staff still does not have complete 2019 data from Southern California Edison (SCE).  As 
data is received, staff reviews and refines the priority list to determine the top 50 usage customers.  Of the top 50 
customers, there are nine which are considered to be the top users.  Of these top nine, four were lost due to the 
customers being direct access customers.  If WCE is able to provide the necessary daily information to these 
customers, they have indicated that they are willing to participate in WCE. 
 
There are approximately 11,500 commercial accounts, with an opt-out rate of 2.6%; commercial opt-outs 
account for approximately 7.5% of the total opt-outs.   Analysis templates are now operational and are used to 
project cost savings, custom usage reviews, and assist to determine applicable tariff. 
 
While outreach programs with member jurisdictions continue, they have been hampered by COVID-19. 
 
Chair Ben Benoit asked staff to reach out to the Directors within those areas of the direct access customers for 
any assistance. 
 
Action: 
1. 
Received and filed. 
 
 
D. 
Joint Rate Comparison Update 
 
Barbara Spoonhour reported that the Joint Rate Comparison (JRC) must be completed and posted to WCE’s 
and Southern California Edison’s (SCE) website within 60 days of a rate change.  Notices must be mailed to all 
customers each July.  The JRC utilizes SCE’s 3-year average load data.  The current JRC is comparing WCE’s and 
SCE’s April 2020 rates.  Staff still has no access to SCE’s methodology for flattening its Time-of-Use (TOU) 
3
rates.   
 
WCE currently has 25 customers in the Choice Plus Plan.  SCE’s 100% green rate, as of April 2020, is 
significantly lower than what the bundled customers are being charged.  SCE has indicated that it will have a 
rate change for its green rate but has not indicated when.  WCE’s Choice Plus Plan is now approximately 2% 
higher that SCE’s green rate. 
 
Chair Ben Benoit indicated that SCE’s green rate is not 100% green. 
 
Ms. Spoonhour indicated that it is a mixture and not 10% renewable. 
 
Craig Martin indicated that he spoke to SCE, which cannot break down its own green rate, as there are very few 
customers who opt-up to this rate. 
 
The Directors expressed interest in reducing WCE’s rate in order to remain competitive with SCE. 
 
Action: 
1. 
Directed staff to return to the next meeting with a resolution to adopt a rate change to 
the Choice Plus Plan. 
 
 
E. 
Updated Generation Rates for Calendar Year 2020 
 
Tyler Masters reported that initial rates were adopted in January 2020, and in February changes were also made 
and adopted.  These changes resulted in generation rates for Choice Plan product to be 4% lower in generation 
rates and an overall 2% savings on customers’ bills.  
 
Staff identified a small rate discrepancy for small to medium commercial users with an electrical demand 
between 20kW and 200kW.  Staff recommends a decrease in the rates to align with the goal of providing 
electricity at a 4% cost lower than SCE’s rates.  The rate changes are only on the energy charge side. 
 
Barbara Spoonhour indicated that SCE is scheduled for a rate change in June 2020.  It appears that SCE is 
changing primarily the delivery side.  Staff doesn’t believe that we will return with any changes to generation 
rates with the next SCE update. 
 
Director Todd Rigby asked if this change is reflected in the Budget presented today. 
 
Andrew Ruiz responded that it is. 
 
Action: 
1. 
Adopted Resolution No. 2020-09:  A Resolution of the Board of Directors of Western 
Community Energy adopting an updated Rate Schedule and rescinding Resolution No. 
2020-08. 
 
 
F. 
Amended Collections and Bad Debt Policy 
 
Andrew Ruiz reported that in November 2019, this Board adopted a resolution which established a Delinquent 
Accounts, Collections, and Bad Debt Policy, which indicates that customers who do not pay their bill within 90 
days (or 60 days for residential) would have their account returned to Southern California Edison (SCE). 
 
Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, SCE adopted consumer protections per direction of the State which 
includes a moratorium to protect customers against shut-offs should a customer not be able to pay their utility 
bill, among other matters. 
 
Staff is working with SCE for clarification on some of these matters. 
 
Staff is requesting that WCE adopt an addendum to the resolution that would delay non-payment to 180 days 
for both commercial and residential customers, and that the Bad Debt Policy be increased from .5% to actual 
amounts determined through WCE’s aging report.  Any changes would take effect immediately and revert back 
4
on January 1, 2021, unless a further extension is necessary due to the pandemic. 
 
Director Todd Rigby recommended adding language to the effect of 1% or actual aging numbers, whichever is 
greater.  Additionally, effects of the pandemic may extend beyond January 2021.  The Policy should be brought 
back for review prior to reverting back. 
 
It was determined by the Board that staff would return every 60-days with an update. 
 
Director Chris Barajas asked who is setting up payment plans and are staff aware of any local jurisdictions 
which may have implemented moratoriums on utility shut-offs. 
 
Mr. Ruiz responded that staff are working with SCE to determine what payment plans and reporting will look 
like. 
 
Barbara Spoonhour added that during the meet and confer meeting with SCE, staff attempted to discuss the 
transition coming out of the moratorium; however, SCE is not thinking that far out, it is trying to deal with 
current matters. 
 
Director Ted Hoffman asked if SCE requires a hardship letter or form from the customer as a result of COVID-
19. 
 
Ms. Spoonhour responded that SCE believes the customer needs to call SCE to make it known there is a 
hardship versus the customer not needing to do anything at all.  CARE and FERA Program customers are 
encouraged to apply for assistance. 
 
Action: 
1. 
Adopted Resolution No. 2020-10:  A Resolution of the Board of Directors of Western 
Community Energy adopting an Amended Policy No. 013: Delinquent Account, 
Collection, and Bad Debt Policy related to COVID-19, to include language to the effect 
of 1% or actual aging numbers, whichever is greater.

Regulatory and Legislative Activities Update

The purpose of this item is to provide an update on recent regulatory and legislative activities that have occurred that 
may affect WCE and other CCAs. 
 
REQUESTED ACTION: 
 
1. 
Receive and file. 
 
Legislative Update:   As part of WCE’s Membership with CalCCA, its legislative staff have provided the following 
information.   
 
COVID-19 and the Legislative Calendar:  The last update reported was that the Legislature would resume on May 4th 
but that there were no details on how the various legislative deadlines and procedures would be updated to account 
for the nearly seven weeks of delay.  The Assembly and Senate released an updated calendar to provide a clearer look 
on when bills will be heard and the various legislative deadlines that needed to be updated.  By and large, most of the 
deadlines were simply moved forward by about six weeks, although since the Assembly started on May 4th and the 
Senate started on May 11th, the deadlines that typically apply to both houses and that occur simultaneously, are 
separated by a week.  Both houses will have a summer recess; however, the recesses will begin much earlier and the 
Assembly will break for a full month while the Senate breaks for only two weeks.  Both houses reconvene from their 
summer recesses on July 13th (prior to the COVID-19 disruption, both houses were to return from their summer 
recesses on August 3rd) and at that point, its calendars will be identical until they adjourn for the legislative year at 
midnight on August 31st.  
 
COVID-19 and the Legislative Process:  Recognizing the numerous operational challenges that COVID-19 has created, 
the Legislature has implemented many new procedures to enforce social distancing.  To ensure that Legislators and 
staff maintain six feet of distancing, only two locations for committee hearings are being used by the Assembly and 
Senate.  This has resulted in far fewer committee hearings each day.  In fact, each house has only calendared two to 
three hearings per day, about one-third of normal.  Also, in the Assembly, each committee will only be permitted one 
hearing instead of the customary four to six hearings per committee.  The Senate is scheduled to have only one 
hearing per committee but has left the door open for additional hearings for unresolved, essential issues.  In-person 
public testimony is permitted but discouraged and call-in numbers as well as video conference rooms in the Capitol 
have been provided.  Written testimony is also encouraged.  Each Capitol office is permitted to have one staff person 
in the office per day and everyone who enters the Capitol must be wearing a facemask and temperatures are taken at 
the entrance.

As can be expected the necessary public access safeguards have made lobbying very challenging for both the general 
public and seasoned lobbyists.  Access to staff and legislators is limited, stifling much of the necessary dialogue that 
allows legislators to make the most informed decisions.  Further complicating matters, some legislators are deciding 
not to come to Sacramento which requires them to be replaced on the committees.  However, the replacement is not 
typically assigned to the committee until that same day which makes lobbying the legislator and staff nearly 
impossible.  Also, typically, the replacement legislator and their staff are not as informed on the general issues the 
committee faces.  
 
Out of concern that controversial or complicated issues will not receive the appropriate input from stakeholders and 
the public, and so that the Legislature can focus on addressing the impacts of COVID-19 and the economy, over the 
last month, the policy committee chairs have worked with bill authors to table their bills for 2020 legislative year.  As a 
result, hundreds of bills have been put on hold for the remainder of the session and will need to be reintroduced as 
new bills in 2021.  For example, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the energy committees in both houses had each 
planned to hear well over one hundred bills.  However, as of May 13th, the Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and 
Commerce was only expected to hear five bills and the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Energy, a mere one bill. 
The hundreds of other bills have all been tabled for the remainder of the 2019-2020 legislative session.  For some 
issues, the committee chairs have offered to help achieve some of the intended goals outside of the legislative process. 
 
Below is an extensive table of bills that CalCCA is tracking.  In addition, if the CalCCA Board has taken a position, it is 
also annotated.

Establishes the California Public Utilities 
Commission’s (CPUC) regulatory 
authority over public utilities, including 
electrical corporations.  Requires each 
electrical corporation to annually prepare 
and submit a wildfire mitigation plan to 
the CPUC for review and approval, as 
specified. Requires a wildfire mitigation 
plan of an electrical corporation to

SB 804 
Wiener 
Allows publicly owned electric utilities to 
issue rate reduction bonds, a type of 
financing mechanism already used by 
public water and wastewater agencies and, 
in some cases, investor-owned electric 
utilities.  Rate reduction bonds can help 
utilities invest in projects such as clean 
energy development, equipment 
upgrades, and more in a cost-effective 
manner that saves ratepayers money. 
05/12/20:  Referral to Senate 
Energy, Utilities, and 
Communications Committee.  
Rescinded due to the shortened 
2020 Legislative Calendar. 
 
SB 862

corporation, as a part of its public safety 
mitigation protocols, to include protocols 
that deal specifically with access and 
functional need individuals, as defined, 
including those individuals who are 
enrolled in the California Alternative 
Rates for Energy program. This bill would 
recast those provisions to authorize the 
electrical corporation to deploy backup 
resources to a customer, including an 
individual with an access of functional 
need, as defined, and would delete the 
requirement that the customer not be 
eligible for backup electrical resources 
from the other providers. 
05/20/20:  Read second time and 
amended. Re-referred to Senate 
Committee on Appropriations.  
Committee hearing set for

against which to measure the prudency of 
an IOUs conduct of a public safety power 
shutoff (PSPS) and an electrical 
corporation’s fire risk mitigation capital 
expenditures on the distribution or 
transmission infrastructure that motivated 
the PSPS.  
 
The bill would also require IOUS to 
identify and report to the commission at 
least 15% of its transmission and 
distribution infrastructure that is most 
likely to cause a PSPS or ignite a wildfire, 
that needs fire risk mitigation capital 
expenditures, and for which fire risk 
mitigation capital expenditures have not 
been made by July 1, 2021. The bill 
establishes timelines for the fire 
mitigation capital expenditures: 50% of 
the identified infrastructure by July 1, 2023; 
75% by July 1, 2024; 100% by July 1, 2025.

Item 5.A 
Western Community Energy 
Joint Meeting of the  
Board of Directors and  
Technical Advisory Committee 
STAFF REPORT
Subject: 
Adoption of Fiscal Year 2020/2021 Agency Budget 
Contact: 
Andrew Ruiz, WRCOG Chief Financial Officer, aruiz@wrcog.us, (951) 405-6740 
Date: 
June 10, 2020 
The purpose of this item is to present the Agency Budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020/2021 and to adopt the Budget. 
REQUESTED ACTION: 
1.
Adopt Resolution No. 2020-11; A Resolution of the Board of Directors of Western Community Energy adopting
the Fiscal Year 2020/2021 Agency Budget.
The Agency’s FY 2020/2021 Budget features the first full year of operations, which includes providing customers the 
choice between 37% renewable energy and 100% green energy, maintaining rates at 4% below Southern California 
Edison (SCE) generation rates, and creating a 2% savings on the customers’ overall bill.  The FY 2020/2021 Budget 
being presented totals $102.2 million in revenues offset by $90 million in expenses.  The Budget was developed on the 
basis of 121,000 customer accounts, and 1,472,089 megawatt hours (MWhs) of net customer consumption.  Major 
highlights of the FY 2020/2021 Operating Budget include a net surplus of over $12 million which will be primarily used 
for cash reserves, which is in alignment with the Board’s priorities to build cash reserves up to a minimum of 25 - 35% 
of the prior year’s annual Operating Budget.  Building up of reserves also mitigates the impact of rate increases, 
enhances credit, and provides purchasing leverage on future power supply.  
Revenues ($102,209,081):  Budgeted electricity revenues are based on estimates of customer electricity usage and retail 
electricity rates of approximately 121,000 customer accounts and 1.4 million MWh’s of net load to serve residential and 
commercial customers.  Electricity revenues include an allowance for uncollectable accounts ($824,305), which is 
currently set at 1% through the end of the year 2020 due to any potential COVID-19 impacts.  Forecasted opt-up 
revenues ($73,604) are associated with the premium charged for serving Choice Plus Plan customers and represents a 
.5% opt-up from the total customer load.  Staff are also currently evaluating opt-out and opt-up behavior and will 
adjust if there are any significant changes. 
Expenses - Power Supply ($85,430,250):  Power supply costs include expenses associated with the purchase of energy 
from wholesale suppliers, the California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO), and charges associated with CAISO 
for power and services performed by CAISO.  CAISO is responsible to account for all power transferred through the 
wholesale markets and balance the supply with the demand.  The bulk of the power WCE purchases is derived from 
projections based on trends dependent on the day and time of year.  The final purchases are based on the actual 
amount of power being used at the last minute by our customers.  The price for the power purchased from the 
wholesale suppliers are the result of Requests for Proposals and finalized negotiated supply contracts.  The price for 
the power purchased from the CAISO is based on the day-ahead and real-time market value at the time.  CAISO 
charges and credits are industry standard and are based on the amount of power transferred through the system and 
include: 
23
• 
Day-ahead and real-time power purchases  
• 
Default Load Aggregation Point (DLAP) charges  
• 
Revenues arising from Congestion Revenue Rights (CRRs) and credits for energy procured above the actual 
final needs.  CRRs are financial instruments created by CAISO, which enable load-serving entities, such as 
WCE, to manage price differences between wholesale energy delivery locations and retail use points.  
 
WCE has currently hedged 2,088,500 MWhs over the period of May 2020 – December 2021, which is below the 
previously projected forecast, or a savings of $3,531,484 over the period.  Furthermore, WCE has locked in its energy 
prices for the bulk of its load, during the hottest period over the summer (June – Sept), lower than the weighted 
average market price during the same period.  To date, WCE has procured from three wholesale suppliers through the 
end of December 2021: Morgan Stanley, BP Energy, and TransAlta Energy.   
 
Legal ($100,000):  Legal services will support contracting, including contracting for short-term energy, Resource 
Adequacy, long-term renewable energy, regulatory activity, and compliance.  Providers of Legal Services are Best Best 
& Krieger.  
 
Program Expense ($52,000):  On March 11, 2020, the WCE Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 2020-06, 
adopting an incentive for current SCE Smart Energy Program (SEP) customers.  For summer 2020, WCE will offer 
current SCE SEP customers that do not opt-out of WCE, a credit of $10 per month (up to $40) for the months of June, 
July, August, and September 2020.  There are currently 1,300 eligible SEP customer within WCE territory that would 
receive the credit through summer 2020. 
 
General Operations and Administration ($1,288,358):  General Operations and Administration expenses include fully 
burdened rates of staff allocated to WCE.  Staffing includes the WCE Director, WCE Program Manager, WCE Senior 
Analyst and a portion of WRCOG’s administrative staff, which includes the Executive Director, Chief Financial 
Officer, Administrative Services Manager, Accounting Program Manager, Administrative Assistant, and a Staff 
Technician.  The fully burdened rate includes salaries, benefits, and overhead, which captures the administrative costs 
of WRCOG, such as IT, rent, etc.  General expenses are budgeted at $30k, which includes miscellaneous general office 
operational expenses. 
 
Consulting Services ($2,903,334):  Consulting services include rate setting and energy management-related services 
such as scheduling coordination, call center management, rate setting, energy portfolio management consulting 
services, including assistance with risk management, and support for Request for Offers for Energy Resources. 
Providers of consulting services include EES Consulting (rates), Pilot Power Group (portfolio manager, scheduling 
coordinator and regulatory support), Calpine Solutions (data management and customer services), and the Creative 
Bar (marketing and outreach).  
 
Finance and Interest Expense ($255,934):  Finance and interest expenses represent fees, borrowing, and letter of credit 
costs associated with WCE’s loan facility.  The increase reflects expected utilization of the line of credit for the 
remainder of FY 2019/2020, payment of loan, and non-utilization fees to Barclay’s Bank.  
 
Other Considerations:  While WCE anticipates a balanced budget and is currently in stable financial condition, there 
are risks and challenges that can impact the Agency in the short- and long-term.   
 
Power Cost Indifference Adjustment (PCIA):  The PCIA, or “exit fee,” is assessed by SCE to cover generation costs 
acquired prior to a customer’s change in service provider.  The fee has increased annually and significantly in recent 
years; however, they should decline over time as WCE’s PCIA vintage has been set and is not subject to SCE’s new 
generation purchases.   
 
Regulatory:  Uncertainty in regulatory decisions by the California Public Utilities Commission could adversely affect 
the cost that customers have to pay to take service from WCE.   
 
Load forecasting and SCE rate changes:  Operating expenses and revenue may change due to updates of the load 
forecast following receipt of additional historical usage data from SCE, opt-out rates from the May 2020 enrollment 
becoming clearer, changes to both SCE and WCE rates that are expected to change five times in the upcoming fiscal 
year, and changes in market prices which impact the cost of energy.   
 
24
Opt-outs:  Opt-out behavior is also being evaluated, but as of May 27, 2020, the WCE opt-out rate is 3.85%, which is still 
lower than 5% residential and 10% commercial opt-out assumptions used for financial modeling.   
 
COVID-19:  The COVID-19 pandemic has placed moratoriums on utility bill disconnections, which could potentially 
impact cashflows and non-payment, which is why WCE has increased its allowance for doubtful accounts.  WCE will 
continue to regularly monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and adjust the budget based on observed data and/or changes 
to underlying assumptions, if necessary, as the situation evolves. 
 
 
PRIOR ACTION:  
 
May 13, 2020: 
The Board of Directors received and filed. 
 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
 
All known and expected revenues and expenditures impacting the Agency have been budgeted for Fiscal Year 
2020/2021 but will be continually updated throughout the Budget process.

STAFF REPORT
Subject: 
Updated Choice Plus Plan Generation Rates for Calendar Year 2020 
Contact: 
Tyler Masters, WRCOG Program Manager, tmasters@wrcog.us, (951) 405-6732 
Date: 
June 10, 2020 
The purpose of this item is to update WCE Choice Plus Plan Generation Rates for Western Community Energy with an 
effective date of June 1, 2020, for Calendar Year 2020. 
REQUESTED ACTION: 
1. 
Adopt Resolution No. 2020-12;  A Resolution of the Board of Directors of Western Community Energy adopting
updated Rate Schedules and rescinding Resolution No. 2020-09.
Background:  On January 8, 2020, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 2020-01, adopting rates for January 
2020.  On February 12, 2020, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2020-05, providing additional rates and 
administrative changes to WCE’s April 2020 rates.  On April 8, 2020, the Board of Director adopted Resolution No. 
2020-08 adopting an updated rate schedule.  On May 13, 2020, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No.2020-09 
adopting an updated rate schedule. 
WCE Choice Plus 100% Plan Update:  Southern California Edison’s (SCE) latest rate changes have resulted in SCE’s 
100% green generation rate decreasing lower than its 37% renewable default rate.  SCE staff have confirmed that they 
calculated the Green Rate differently and that there were credits associated with its Cost Responsibility Surcharge 
(CRS) that are included in the 100% green rate.  SCE staff did indicate that it would probably be changing the rate again 
in the future but did not indicate when that might happen, or if this future change would impact the 100% green rate.  
Due of this change, WCE’s 100% green rate is now higher than SCE’s 100% green rate.  
Currently, WCE’s 100% Choice Plus Plan premium is 1.5 cents/kWh on top of the Choice Plan generation rate.  To 
remain cost competitive with SCE’s 100% rate, WCE would need to reduce the premium to 1.0 cent/kWh.   The fiscal 
impact to this change is roughly $25,000 as there are currently under 30 customers enrolled in the Choice Plus Plan.  In 
May 2020, the Board confirmed interest to remain competitive with SCE rates and as such requested a resolution be 
brought back for Board approval in June 2020 adopting rates that reflect a reduction in the Choice Plus Plan premium 
from 1.5 cent/kWh to 1.0 cent/kWh. 
PRIOR ACTION: 
May 13, 2020: 
The Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 2020-09:  A Resolution of the Board of 
Directors of Western Community Energy adopting an updated Rate Schedule and rescinding 
Resolution No. 2020-08. 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
This rate change has an approximate fiscal impact of $25,000; WCE would still be on target to meet its reserve goals.

A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
WESTERN COMMUNITY ENERGY  
ADOPTING UPDATED RATE SCHEDULES AND  
RESCINDING RESOLUTION NO. 2020-09 
 
WHEREAS, Western Community Energy (“WCE”) was formed on August 23, 2018, pursuant to 
the Western Community Energy Joint Powers Agreement (“JPA”); and  
 
WHEREAS, the WCE Implementation Plan and Statement of Intent describes the policies and 
procedures for setting and modifying electric rates for the WCE community choice energy 
program; and 
 
WHEREAS, WCE’s objectives are, among other things, to provide local control in rate setting 
and provide overall rates that are lower and/or competitive with those offered by the 
incumbent utility for similar power supplies; and 
 
WHEREAS, WCE is in the process of partnering with experienced energy suppliers to provide 
competitive products in order to meet WCE’s objectives; and 
 
WHEREAS, WCE’s rate design mirrors the structure of the incumbent utility and is based on 
cost of service, market prices, the power charge indifference adjustment, and WCE operational 
costs; and 
 
WHEREAS, there have been changes in the incumbent utilities rate structure that will impact 
the rates previously adopted by WCE and these changes have resulted in a re-evaluation of the 
WCE rates to preserve the target cost savings for WCE ratepayers; and 
 
WHEREAS, the WCE Board of Directors desires to adopt a rate schedule consistent with the 
Implementation Plan and WCE rate objectives. 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, THE WESTERN COMMUNITY ENERGY BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
DOES HEREBY RESOLVE, DETERMINE AND ORDER AS FOLLOWS:  
 
1. The Board of Directors has determined that the recitals herein are true and correct. 
 
2.   The Board of Directors hereby rescinds Resolution No. 2020-09. 
 
3. The Board of Directors hereby adopts the attached rate schedules for Calendar Year 2020 
effective June 1, 2020. 
39
 
4.   This Resolution shall be effective immediately after its adoption by the Board of Directors. 
 
PASSED AND ADOPTED by the Board of Directors on June 10, 2020.

Western Community Energy 
Joint Meeting of the  
Board of Directors and  
Technical Advisory Committee 
 
STAFF REPORT 
 
 
Subject: 
Program Launch Update 
 
Contact: 
Tyler Masters, WRCOG Program Manager, tmasters@wrcog.us, (951) 405-6732 
 
Date: 
June 10, 2020 
 
 
The purpose of this item is to provide an update on WCE launch activities, outreach, and marketing / advertising 
initiatives. 
 
REQUESTED ACTION: 
 
1. 
Review and provide input. 
 
 
Background:  WCE launched electric service to the Cities of Norco, Perris, and Wildomar in April 2020, and to the 
Cities of Eastvale, Hemet, and Jurupa Valley in May 2020.  As part of the launch, staff is working on a number of launch 
initiatives as identified below. 
 
WCE Call Center Update:  The WCE Call Center went live on February 3, 2020.  Every week since, Call Center staff 
produces weekly reports to inform WCE of the Call Center and opt-out activity.   
 
The weekly recap below shows the weekly opt-out of the total 126,481 eligible accounts.  Total eligible accounts include 
all community members’ accounts (residential, non-residential, and municipal accounts, etc.).  The summary illustrates 
the opt-outs received by week.  Staff have determined that increases in opt-out rates are generally due to the 
distribution of mailers.  For example, the day community members receive a WCE mailer, staff sees slightly higher opt-
outs, followed by a steady decrease in following weeks.  WCE will likely see opt-out rates become stable, with very little 
increase or decrease, by the end of July 2020, at which time all residents will have received their pre- and post-
enrollment notifications, and Joint Rate Comparison (JRC) mailers.

Weekly Summary

JRC and Mailer:  The JRC is a joint utility (SCE and WCE) effort to provide a side-by-side comparison of generation 
rates by utility.  A JRC is required within 60 days after either utility makes a change to its rates.  The JRC must be 
posted on SCE and WCE’s website within 60 days of the rate becoming active.   In addition, each July a JRC must be 
mailed to all customers.  At the May WCE Board meeting, staff provided an update on the JRC.  Since that time, the 
JRC has been posted on WCE’s website (https://westerncommunityenergy.com/billing-and-rates/). 
 
Additionally, the JRC mailers (attachment 1 - 3) have been completed and will be distributed to all customers in July.  
Three separate mailers have been created for distribution and represent three of the most common customer rate 
types within the subregion: 1) Domestic, 2) Domestic (CARE), and 3) Small and Large business customers.   
 
Billing & Enrollment Issues:  Since WCE launch and during the “stay-at-home” orders, a couple of billing and 
enrollment issues have occurred.   
 
1. 
Missing WCE charge description on Utility Bill:  Prior to the WCE May 2020 Board meeting, staff was informed of 
a billing issue that impacted 5,541 April 2020 bills across Norco, Perris, and Wildomar.  Affected customers 
received bills that included the correct cost of the WCE generation rates but was missing a detailed breakdown of 
the generation charge including usage, rate, and surcharges.  This issue was caught before other April bills were 
sent out, and while the issue has been remedied, the root cause of this issue within SCE’s system is currently 
unclear.  Other CCAs that launched in April were also affected. 
 
2. Some CARE / FERA Program customers were dropped from the Program:  On May 14, 2020, SCE informed WCE 
staff of an error that occurred due to the verification / recertification process changes due to COVID-19.  The error 
caused 472 income-qualified CARE / FERA Program customers to be dropped from the Program.  Per SCE, the 
impacted customers were likely in the middle of the CARE / FERA verification process when changes were made 
to process, causing customers to be dropped.  SCE is currently in the process of manually updating its records to 
re-enroll these affected customers into the Program.  This error happened to other CCA and bundled customers, 
as well. 
 
Marketing & Advertising:  In January 2020, staff brought an item to the Board to discuss post-launch marketing and 
advertising needs as WCE transitions to post-launch communications.  The Board asked staff to reach out to other 
CCAs to identify the evolution in its marketing initiatives as they progressed through launch and then bring a

recommendation and opportunities back to the Board after launch.  In February 2020, staff provided the results of the 
CCA outreach.  Since that time, staff have gathered additional information and recommend the Board pivot away 
from the broad mass media outreach (like paid YouTube, movie theatre, and electronic billboard ad space) and move 
towards a balanced outreach approach that focuses on the personal touch with the community.  This can be done 
through participation in community events that allow for opportunities to speak directly to the community, active 
tracking and participation in social media, and balanced print / digital advertising with Pandora and the Press 
Enterprise that has previously provided WCE with focused outreach to the community. 
 
Post-Launch Marketing & Outreach Plan: 
 
1. 
Social Media management – includes generating and posting two targeted advertisements per week 
2. Community engagement & sponsorship opportunities 
a. Participation in community events with focus on direct community engagement 
b. Sponsorship opportunities including but not limited to local service clubs, state of the cities, various local 
events 
3. Print / digital advertisements (on a case-by-case basis) 
a. Pandora 
b. Press Enterprise 
 
Marketing and outreach expenditures are included in the Fiscal Year 2020/2021 Budget.

As a part of our ongoing commitment to better 
serve our residential customers, WCE and SCE 
have come together to provide your family with 
a comparison of average monthly charges of our 
common residential rates. If this comparison 
does not address your current rate plan, or if you 
have further questions, please visit us online at 
WesternCommunityEnergy.com or SCE.com/cca.
The comparison chart illustrates the estimated 
electricity costs for a typical residential customer 
within WCE’s service territory with an average 
monthly consumption of 533 kilowatt hours 
(kWh). 
This comparison is based on WCE rates 
approved by the Board of Directors, effective as 
of April 1, 2020, and revised Choice Plus Plan 
effective June 1, 2020. SCE rate options are based 
on rates published April 13, 2020. Both WCE and 
SCE’s rates are subject to change. 
SCE implemented a rate change in June 2020, which is not reflected in 
this Joint Rate Comparison.
If this comparison does not address your current rate 
plan or if you have further questions, please contact:

Generation Rate reflects the cost of producing or purchasing electricity to power your home. This rate will vary 
depending on your service provider and rate plan.
SCE Delivery Rate reflects the SCE cost to deliver electricity to your home. This rate depends on usage.
Surcharges represents the Cost Responsibility Surcharge (CRS) and Franchise Fee (FF) that are applicable 
to Western Community Energy (WCE) customers and SCE customers that elect a Green Rate. The CRS is a 
surcharge to recover costs associated with power purchases made on behalf of customers prior to a customer’s 
switch to WCE or SCE Green Rate. The FF recovers taxes owed to a city in exchange for allowing SCE to utilize 
electrical distribution lines throughout the property of the city. SCE acts as the collection agency for the FF 
surcharge which is levied by cities and counties for all customers.

Non-Residential Client Engagement and Outreach Update 
 
Contact: 
Don Ries, WRCOG Program Manager, dries@wrcog.us, (951) 405-6726 
 
Date: 
June 10, 2020 
 
 
The purpose of this item is to provide an update on WCE’s non-residential client engagement and outreach. 
 
REQUESTED ACTION: 
 
1. 
Receive and file. 
 
 
Background:  The primary purpose of this agenda item is to provide a point of contact for general and specific technical 
questions and concerns unique to the larger industrial and governmental WCE clients.  This is accomplished through 
client outreach introductory and follow-up meetings to reinforce the concept, savings potential, and the potential 
benefits 0f participating in WCE.  In addition, staff is offering other services such as the Joint Rate Comparisons (JRC), 
cost saving projections, custom usage and applicable tariff analysis reviews.  WCE staff is available to all members as a 
tool to help attract and keep businesses within its city. 
 
Program update:  WCE staff continues to refine the list of top clients based on usage as updated information on usages 
is received from SCE for accounts within the WCE service territory.  Progress updating client lists and jurisdiction 
priority lists has been hampered by COVID-19 and data disparities; however, the efforts continue.  Initial contact as 
well as follow-up calls and emails for the top 20 users is complete.  Staff continues to initiate introductory and follow-
up meetings with these key clients and the next tier of clients.  A virtual presentation was completed for the Jurupa 
Community Service District Board on May 11, 2020.   
 
To date, seven top 50 tier clients and four lower tier clients have committed to staying with WCE.  Additionally, another 
13 top 50 tier clients and three other key clients are expected to stay.  Since the last report, no additional top 50 tier 
clients have opted-out.  As of May 25, 2020, the opt-out rate for commercial clients is 3.5%, well under 10% opt-out 
assumptions used in financial proformas. 
 
Several templates which are used to facilitate the JRC, cost savings projections, custom usage reviews, and applicable 
tariff analysis reviews are operational and are being refined.  The latest revision is due to the SCE rate change effective 
June 1, 2020. 
 
Ongoing efforts:  WCE staff will continue to work with city staff to identify the top businesses in its community.  WCE 
staff will continue to refine and expand the targeting from the initial parameters of load and tax base size.  Each month, 
staff will report to the Board on how WCE’s customer engagement and outreach campaign is progressing.  Once 
metrics are fully developed, the report will include statistics.  A Senior Analyst has been hired and started on June 1, 
2020, who will also assist with outreach and customer relations.

Emergency Customer Protections due to COVID-19  
 
Contact: 
Andrew Ruiz, WRCOG Chief Financial Officer, aruiz@wrcog.us, (951) 405-6740 
 
Date: 
June 10, 2020 
 
 
The purpose of this item is to provide information on Southern California Edison’s (SCE) meet and confer process with 
operating CCAs, as it pertains to emergency customer protections related to COVID-19, and process for the repayment 
waterfall of delayed payments. 
 
REQUESTED ACTION: 
 
1. 
Receive and file. 
 
 
Background:  COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions to the nation’s economy with record unemployment numbers 
and with many U.S. citizens unable to cover their expenses.   In response to this, the Governor of California issued an 
order to all utilities protecting customers against shutoffs due to nonpayment of their utility bills.  The California 
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) then passed Resolution M-4842, an emergency authorization and order to direct 
utilities to implement emergency customer protections to support California customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic.  The Emergency Customer Protections apply to customers for up to one-year from April 2020 when the 
Resolution was passed.  
 
The Emergency Customer Protections include: 
 
1) Waive deposit requirements for residential customers seeking to reestablish service for one year and expedite 
move-in and move-out service requests; 
2) Stop estimated usage for billing attributed to the time period when a home / unit was unoccupied as a result of the 
emergency; 
3) Identify the premises of affected customers whose utility service has been disrupted or degraded and discontinue 
billing these premises without assessing a disconnection charge; 
4) Prorate any monthly access charge or minimum charges; 
5) Implement payment plan options for residential customers; 
6) Suspend disconnection for nonpayment and associated fees, waive deposit and late fee requirements for residential 
customers; 
7) Support low-income residential customers by:  
a. Freezing all standard and high-usage reviews for the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program 
eligibility for 12-months and potentially longer, as warranted;  
b. Contacting all community outreach contractors and community-based organizations which assist in enrolling 
hard-to-reach, low-income customers into CARE, to help better inform customers of these eligibility changes; 
c. Partnering with the Program administrator of the customer funded Emergency Assistance Program for low-
income customers and increasing the assistance limit amount for the next 12 months;  
d. Indicate how the Energy Savings Assistance Program can be deployed to assist customers; 
8) Suspend all CARE and FERA Program removals to avoid unintentional loss of the discounted rate during the 
period for which the customer is protected under these customer protections; 
119
9) Discontinue generating all recertification and verification requests that require customers to provide their current 
income information; 
10) Offer repair processing and timing assistance and timely access to utility customers. 
11) Include these customer protections as part of larger community outreach and public awareness plans; and 
12) Meet and confer with the Community Choice Aggregators as early as possible to discuss their roles and 
responsibilities for each emergency customer protection. 
 
Meet and Confer with SCE:  The emergency customer protections outlined in the CPUC Resolution is ultimately SCE’s 
responsibility to implement as it relates to CCA customers; however, CCA’s will be impacted by these protections 
pertaining to disconnections due to nonpayment.  Since customers could technically stop paying their bill without any 
notification to SCE, as there is no need to certify or prove that they are undergoing a hardship, this could potentially 
create a cashflow issue for SCE and CCA’s.  Unpaid utilities bill will not be forgiven, but rather delayed per the process 
identified below. 
 
In SCE’s second meet and confer meeting with CCA’s held on May 14, 2020, SCE described its payment posting priority.  
Below is a scenario where a customer begins to short pay their SCE bill and how the waterfall of payments is allocated 
to SCE and CCA’s:  
 
 
 
In this example, on 3/26/2020, the customer short pays their 3/2/2020 invoice.  SCE receives priority to cover its charges 
in full before the CCA receives anything.  On 3/28/2020 the customer makes another payment, which is applied to the 
oldest invoice, and again on 4/6/2020, which then fully pays off the 3/2/2020 invoice.  This process would then start all 
over again on the 4/2/2020 invoice – SCE would need to be paid in full before the CCA’s receive anything. 
 
Below is an example of a customer on a payment plan with SCE.  As with the example above, SCE receives its payment 
in full on the oldest invoice before the CCA receives anything. 
 
 
 
Staff will continue to work with SCE and closely monitor accounts as they begin to become delinquent and payment 
plans arrangements are made.  
 
To support WCE operations and its customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WCE Board approved an 
addendum to WCE’s Bad Debt and Collections Policy to extend the applicable 60- or 90-day period for returning any 
residential or non-residential customers to SCE due to non-payment to 180 days through the end of calendar year 2020.  
Additionally, an addendum was added to the Policy to increase its Bad Debt Policy from 0.5% to 1% or actual amounts 
determined through WCE’s aging report, whichever is higher. 
 
 
PRIOR ACTION:  
 
None.

FISCAL IMPACT: 
 
All known and expected revenues and expenditures impacting the Agency have been budgeted for Fiscal Year 
2020/2021 but will be continually updated throughout the Budget process.

Item 5.F 
 
Western Community Energy 
Joint Meeting of the  
Board of Directors and  
Technical Advisory Committee 
 
STAFF REPORT 
 
 
Subject: 
Consideration of Membership in CalCCA  
 
Contact: 
Barbara Spoonhour, WRCOG Deputy Executive Director – Operations, 
bspoonhour@wrcog.us, (951) 405-6760 
 
Date: 
June 10, 2020 
 
 
The purpose of this item is to provide an overview of CalCCA’s services and discuss with the Board if it would like to 
pursue operational membership with CalCCA. 
 
REQUESTED ACTION: 
 
1. 
Approve Operational Membership with CalCCA and return to the Board of Directors on an annual basis for 
review. 
 
 
Background:  The California Community Choice Association (CalCCA) is a non-profit association with a rapidly 
growing membership.  CalCCA’s mission is to create a legislative and regulatory environment that supports the 
development and long-term sustainability of locally operated Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) electricity 
providers in California.  CalCCA serves members and strengthens a collective voice through education, technical 
guidance, and regulatory and legislative advocacy.  CalCCA represents the interests of CCAs in the legislature and at 
state regulatory agencies, including the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, and 
California Air Resources Board.  
 
Membership:  Currently, all 19 operational CCAs, except King City, are Operational Members of CalCCA, with 13 CCAs 
having a seat on the Board.  For informational purposes only, King City’s CCA is different in that all of its functions are 
run by a single 3rd party; the CalCCA structure is for the CCA to be a member, not a 3rd party.   
 
CalCCA’s voting membership is comprised of operating CCA programs in California that are serving load or about to 
launch.  Operational Members have a voting seat on the CalCCA Board of Directors.  As an Operational Member, staff 
could become involved in the CCA committees which cover topics including regulatory, legislative, marketing / 
communication, and procurement.  For streamlining and strategic purposes, many of these committees are not open to 
consultants or vendors.  The Regulatory Committee coordinates activities and allocates resources on numerous 
proceedings at several California regulatory agencies.   
 
Benefits: CalCCA Partners are given a broad range of benefits, including invitations to exclusive meetings and events, 
access to summary information about key CCA priorities and initiatives, access to booth and information distribution 
at CalCCA annual meetings, and event sponsorship opportunities.  There are also numerous informational committees 
that WCE staff can be involved in, all dealing with current CCA topics and issues, and gaining WCE access to a large 
compilation of CCA developed resources including but not limited to sample agreements, contracts, and regulatory 
tracking. 
 
 
 
123
 
Dues Structure:  In April 2020, the CalCCA Board adopted a total budget of $3,772,900 (Fiscal Year (FY) 2019/2020 
Budget of $3,567,900, plus $205,000).  The calculation for determining membership dues is: 
 
• 
Members’ FY 2019/2020 Revenue multiplied by 0.1918% 
• 
Cap increased from $330,000 to $348,961  
• 
Maintain 3 Fixed Tiers: $15K, $30K, $45K 
• 
CCAs with a revenue of $50M or less have the option of giving up its seat on the CalCCA Board and will not be 
charged a fixed fee 
• 
CCAs with a revenue of $50M or less have the option of joining together and nominating one CCA to the Board 
which will act on its behalf.  The fixed fees will be paid as if for a single member. 
 
Under CalCCA’s new methodology, WCE’s total annual membership fee would be $206,825.  If WCE joins, CalCCA 
would invoice WCE $51,706.25 per quarter. 
 
WCE’s Option:  WCE is currently an Affiliate Member.  CalCCA has informed staff that once WCE begins to service 
load, WCE can no longer be an Affiliate Member, and therefore would need to determine if it wants to become an 
Operational Member.  In May 2020, CalCCA extended an offer to allow WCE to participate in its Board and committee 
meetings (at no charge) to gain insight to the Organization and allow WCE time to determine if the membership dues 
were worthwhile for the remainder of FY 2019/2020. 
 
Staff Recommendation:  While the membership cost is high and WCE is just initiating operations, the benefits of being 
actively connected to the other CCAs in California are substantial.  From the brief time that staff has been participating 
in a number of CALCCA Committee and Board meetings, staff has been able to gain additional access to policies and 
advice from the other CCAs (specifically, around SCE’s implementation of COVID-19 customer protections).  Staff 
believes these benefits will be extremely helpful to our success, and thus supports joining CalCCA as an Operational 
Member for this year.  Membership can be reviewed on an annual basis with the Board.  For Fiscal Year 2020/2021, a 
surplus of approximately $12M is budgeted that will be available for reserves.  The membership dues of $206,825 would 
reduce WCE’s anticipated surplus accordingly, which is approximately 2%. 
 
 
PRIOR ACTION:  
 
March 11, 2020: 
The Board of Directors received and filed. 
 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
 
If the Board of Directors elects to become an Operational Member staff would add the cost to the Agency’s FY 
2020/2021 Annual Budget.  
 
ATTACHMENT: 
 
None.
