BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS 
MEETING MINUTES 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2019

ROLL CALL:  Chairman White, Hansen, Fritsche, Knop, Community Development Director 
(CDD)/Village Planner and Zoning Administrator Retzlaff, Assistant Planner Zandt, and Clerk 
Braunschweig.   
 
APPROVAL OF MINUTES:  August 14, 2019. 
Motion (Fritsche/Hansen) to approve minutes as presented for August 14, 2019.   
Discussion ensued of the objection letters that were on the dias in the August 14, 2019.  Chairman 
White commented that the minutes accurately reflect the meeting.  The objection letters are 
considered part of the record whether or not they were read aloud.  When written comments are 
submitted they are considered part of the record.  Because the individuals were not present to 
testify under oath, it is up to the Board to decide how much weight the written comments have.  
They should be noted that they exist but they are not required to be read.  They would not have 
changed the decision.  Motion Carried Unanimously to Approve the August 14, 2019 Minutes. 
 
PUBLIC HEARING:  
Chairman White read the public hearing notice.  Hearing is to hear any and all parties, their attorneys 
or agents, for or against the VARIANCE APPEAL filed by Katelyn LeTourneau, Agent for Darlene 
LeTourneau, property owner, who is requesting variances from the Village’s Zoning Code (Section 17) to: 
(1) reduce the minimum front/street yard fence setback requirement from 2 feet to 6 inches under Section 
17.50(2)(f)4.; and (2) increase the maximum height allowance for a fence in the front/street yard from 4 to 7 feet 
under Section 17.50(2)(f)3 for the following property:  N120W15515 Freistadt Road, Germantown 
(Tax Key# GTNV 232-991) 
 
Chairman White described the meeting order to Darlene LeTourneau, Kevin Schodron and the gallery 
that normally the Village’s information and review of the Variance is given first and then Darlene 
LeTourneau and Kevin Schodron would have opportunity to give her point of view.  Darlene 
LeTourneau and Kevin Schodron understood the order.   
Chairman White swore in Director Retzlaff. 
 
Director Retzlaff gave history and background of the Variance Appeal for N120W15515 Freistadt Road.   
Director Retzlaff referenced the Village letter dated August 7, 2019, and the denial of the 7 foot high 
fence on Freistadt Road.  The building inspection letter stated that: 
 
Your application proposes a 7' high fence in the front yard. Section 17 .50(2)(f)(3) of the Germantown 
Municipal Code reads, "Fences in front yards may not exceed 4 feet in height, except a maximum height of 
6 feet on approval of the Plan Commission after consideration of visibility, privacy and access concerns."  
Your application also proposes the fence to be located 6 inches off of the front yard lot line. Section 
17.50(2)(f)(4) of the Germantown Municipal Code reads. "No fence shall be closer than 2 feet to a public 
right of way.

This is for the front yard of the property.  A map and photograph of the property was shown.   
The approximate location of the proposed fence was shown. 
Section 17 .50(2)(f)(3) of the Germantown Municipal Code reads, "Fences in front yards may not exceed 4 
feet in height, except a maximum height of 6 feet on approval of the Plan Commission after consideration of 
visibility, privacy and access concerns." 
This request is for a seven foot high fence by definition the side yard is considered a front yard. 
Section 17 .50(2)(f)(4) of the Germantown Municipal Code reads, " No fence shall be closer than 2 feet to a 
public right-of-way." 
 
The request is to locate the fence six inches from the right of way.  The fence is supposed to behind 
or south of the wall.  There is property on the wall that is considered right of way.   
 
By definition of the zoning code a corner lot has two street or front yards for establishing set-backs 
for fences. 
 
The property line is south of Freistadt Road.  The property line and right of way line are the same.     
 
Kevin Schodron interjected that Darlene LeTourneau owns 10 feet of the line from the barn north and 
four feet, three inches is owned by Washington County 
 
The limestone fence is twenty-four inches thick.  The property line is four feet from the limestone. 
 
If the fence is built and if the County wants to do something in the right of way, who is responsible to 
remove the fence?  It would be responsibility of the property owner. 
 
If Freistadt Road were to be widened, additional right of way would be required. 
 
Jim Hanson questioned if the side or rear yard could have a higher height.  The fence heights for front 
and side could be for vision, aesthesis, visibility, access, or privacy concerns.   
 
Is there any County provision for the fence to be in the right of way.  Director Jeff Retzlaff commented 
no. 
 
There was a CSM created back in the 70s that shows the easement. 
 
Chairman White swore in Kevin Schodron of N120W15515 Freistadt Road, Germantown.  He is 
Darlene LeTourneau’s son in law.  Kevin Schodron commented that they had went to the County and 
within two hours they had permits from the County.  The County Highway Supervisor told him that 
they could put the fence on the limestone and they are responsible for it.  Kevin Schodron stated that 
the County has no issues with the fence or location of the fence.   
 
There is only eight feet from the barn.  Every fourth of July they have issues of people walking on the 
wall and broken bottles.  The fence height requested is seven foot; however, he was not sure why it is 
stated that way.  The quote is for a six foot fence.  They want privacy.

Kevin Schodron showed a video of a person coming up to their front door and trying to open it at 2:57 
a.m.  The door was locked.  There was evidence that the person had napped outside by barn and left 
belongings behind. 
They have had property stolen such as concrete decorative cows.   There was a fence there at one time 
but it was dilapidated and they removed it.   
   
Chairman White questioned if the six-foot fence was the intention.  Kevin Schodron stated he did 
not know why the application stated seven-feet fence.  Kevin Schodron stated that they want a 
six feet dog eared cedar fence.   
 
Knop commented that the retaining wall makes the yard unique for security.  The fence could 
start at barn and go East to Pilgrim. 
 
Chairman White reported that by code a corner lot has two front yards. 
 
Kevin Schodron stated that security and safety is the main goal.  And they want the property to 
look nicer. 
 
Fritsche questioned the four-foot fence versus the six-foot fence.  Will this keep people out,  
versus keeping people in so they do not fall on the retaining wall.  They also have a puppy that 
fell off of the retaining wall.  Schodron commented concern of the liability.  They also want 
privacy.  Schodron commented that the old fence was right behind the wall.   
 
Chairman White swore in Darlene LeTourneau of N120W15515 Freistadt Road, Germantown.  
LeTourneau commented that the fence would bring privacy.  Her bedroom is on the first floor.  
Can see right into her room from both ways.   
 
Hansen commented on the fence height and location.  The front yard is often lower because of 
vision triangles and line of sight.   
 
Schodron commented that people already pull out and the fence would not hinder further.   
 
Director Retzlaff pointed out that the County would play a role.  The fence cannot be in the vision 
triangle. 
Discussion of the vision tringle ensued.  It was indicated that the County had already issued a 
permit. 
 
Fritsche questioned if the board can approve something in between.  Director Retzlaff commented 
that the board can approve something in between.  Fritschke questioned if the fence height had 
to be six feet or could it be less.  Schodron and LeTourneau replied the fence had to be at least 
six feet. 
 
Chairman White asked for anyone to speak in favor of the variance to please come forward.  
No one spoke. 
Chairman White asked for anyone to speak in opposition of the variance to please come forward.  
No one spoke.

Chairman White commented that an email was received from Rick Miller in support of the requested 
variance.   
Schodron commented that he talked to a neighbor that was in favor of the variance but could not be at 
the meeting due to work schedule.   
Chairman White asked if there were any other comments for or against the variance or otherwise? 
The Public Hearing was closed at 6:20 p.m. 
The Findings, Conclusions, and Decision and Order were deliberated.   
Chairman White suggested to review the requests separately. 
The first variance request is to reduce the setback from two feet to six inches.   
The variance will or will not be contrary to the public interest and will not be in accord with the spirt of 
the zoning code because temporary means temporary and is defined in the code.   
Fritsche stated that the variance request to reduce the setback from two feet to six inches would not be 
contrary to the public interest.   
White commented he agreed as there will still be considerable distance between the fence and wall.   
Knop commented this is the lesser of the issue and not contrary.  The setback area will not be contrary 
to the public interest.   
There are not exceptional, extraordinary or unusual conditions or circumstances that apply specifically 
to this lot or parcel, use, structure, or intended use that do not apply generally to other property or uses 
in the same district because there are always these types of structures.   
White commented that the retaining wall and right of way makes this property unique.   
Fritsche commented, Why didn’t the County install the fence. 
The variance is not necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed 
by other properties in the same district because he can still use the property.   
White commented on safety as an issue.  The privacy argument does not win the day.  The location on 
the road, the uniqueness of the retaining wall.   
The house line of vision is much higher to see.   
Knop commented that if the variance was not granted the space between the fence and barn would be 
wasted space; however, the fence could be configured differently. This yard is unique because of the 
retaining wall.  Knop commented that the variance is not necessary for the preservation and enjoyment 
of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district because he can still use 
the property.  White commented that it is a close call because of the location of the barn and property 
line .  At certain times of the year the property does get a high number of unwanted guests coming and 
going to Firemen’s Park.

The variance will not create substantial detriment to adjacent property and will be contrary to the public 
interest.   
There are no adjacent property owners except for County and Railroad.   
The literal enforcement of the terms of the Zoning Code would not result in practical difficulty or 
unnecessary hardship to the applicant as he can still use the property.  
White commented that there is practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship.  Fritsche commented that 
they are entitled to build a fence.  Are they forced to build in a way that violates the ordinance or 
hardship.  Fritsche questioned is it for necessity? 
The damage and theft were commented on.   
MOTION (White/Fritsche) to Grant the Variance and Reduce the Setback Requirement from two 
feet to six inches based on the findings of fact.  Motion Failed.  White and Fritsche voted aye; 
Hansen and Knop voted nay. 
Chairman White stated outcome of the Setback variance to appellant.  
 
The second part of the variance is in regard to the height of the fence, from four foot to seven foot.  
Schodron had commented on six feet; however, the application and notice state seven feet.   
 
The variance will or will not be contrary to the public interest and will not be in accord with the spirt of 
the zoning code because temporary means temporary and is defined in the code.   
White commented that the six-foot fence is not contrary to public interest.  Fritsche agreed with White.  
The Plan Commission can approve a six-foot fence. 
There are not exceptional, extraordinary or unusual conditions or circumstances that apply specifically 
to this lot or parcel, use, structure, or intended use that do not apply generally to other property or uses 
in the same district because there are always these types of structures.   
White commented that it abuts a road and has a retraining wall that is very high.  Knop commented that 
the uniqueness of the retaining wall safety and security.  The retaining wall and elevation from the yard 
adds to the security.  Knop commented that the four-foot fence is sufficient and the retaining wall works 
to their advantage.  The code allows a six-foot fence through the plan commission.  They could go to 
the Plan Commission for the six-foot fence.  White commented that the Board of Zoning of Appeals 
could grant the fence.  The application was for seven-foot fence.

The variance is not necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed 
by other properties in the same district because he can still use the property.   
White commented that it could be a safety issue.  He does not agree that the wall serves as a barrier.  He 
commented it is something kids want to climb.   
Knop commented that the variance is not necessary because the retaining wall is an advantage.  The 
variance is not necessary because the retaining wall adds privacy that others do not have.   
The variance will create substantial detriment to adjacent property and will be contrary to the public 
interest.   
There are no adjacent property owners except for County and Railroad.   
The literal enforcement of the terms of the Zoning Code would not result in practical difficulty or 
unnecessary hardship to the applicant as he can still use the property.  
White commented that it would because of safety and security.  A four-foot fence is jumpable.   
Discussion ensued that they could go back to plan commission and request a six-foot fence. White 
commented that the Board of Zoning of Appeals has the authority to grant the six-foot fence.   
White commented he will make a motion and if that motion is denied then a motion can be made 
conditionally to send the request for six-foot fence to Plan Commission. 
MOTION (White/Fritsche) to grant the Variance with respect to the fence be six foot and not 
seven.  If denied than someone can make a motion to make the fence six foot conditional on Plan 
Commission.  Motion Failed.  White and Fritsche voted aye; Hansen and Knop voted nay. 
Chairman White stated outcome of the Setback variance to appellant.  
Chairman White stated next hearing will be as needed.

RE: 
Variance Appeal; N118 W12745 Taylor Trail (Lot 10 of Woodland Ponds Estates Subdivision)  
 
Todd & Anisia Peterman, Applicant 
 
Germantown Acquisitions LLC, Property Owner 
 
 
 
Background 
In April 2020, the Inspection Services Division of the Community Development Department advised 
the applicant to submit a variance application to the Board of Zoning Appeals (BOZA) to reduce 
the front/street yard setback from 120’ to 65’ for Lot 10 of Woodland Ponds Estates. (see [EXHIBIT 
1- Application Materials] dated April 30, 2020). 
 
Appeal/Request 
The applicant is seeking a variance to reduce the front building setback from 120’ to 65’. 
 
Staff Comments 
The final plat of Woodland Pond Estates shows a 120’ setback from the front property line of Lot 
10. The Rs-3 District requires a minimum lot width of 150’. The front setback when the minimum lot 
width is met, is 45’.  Lots adjacent to cul-du-sac bulbs are often pie shaped and do not meet the 
minimum lot width of 150’ adjacent to the road. In this case, and in the case of the subject 
property, the front setback is determined to be at the location the lot widens to meet the 150’ width 
minimum. On Lot 10 of Woodland Pond Estates, the lot width reaches 150’ at the point 120’ back 
from the front lot line.  
 
If the proposed variance to the lot frontage at setback requirement, is approved, all required 
setbacks in the Rs-3 Single Family Residential District would still be met.

3. 
Decision or order is erroneous because: 
 
 
 
(b) Request for Variance of Zoning/Building Code. 
1. 
Describe 
 
the 
 
requested  
variance  
and 
 
dimension  
of  
variance: 
 
Variance requested to reduce the minimum lot frontage at setback from 150’ 
to ~110’, thus reducing the front building setback from 120’ to ~65’.  This 
variance is being requested because a hardship for safety and practical 
difficulty is being created by having to build at 120’ when it was noticed that 
the final plat differed from the preliminary Village approved plat as well as the 
plat shown on the grading plan and soil perc report which were consistent with 
the pre-plat (see attached plats and grading plan). 
 
2. 
Explain 
how 
the 
Variance, 
IF 
granted, 
is 
consistent 
with 
the spirit, purpose and intent of the Code: 
 
Reducing the minimum lot frontage at setback does not infringe upon 
any adjacent properties and maintains the minimum front building 
setback of 45’, side setback of 20’ and rear setback of 35’ for an Rs-3 
zoned property. 
 
3. Describe the exceptional, extraordinary or unusual 
conditions or circumstances that apply specifically to 
this lot/parcel, use, structure, or intended use that DO 
NOT apply generally to other properties or uses in the 
SAME district: 
 
This particular lot with a 120’ setback would pose a safety concern with 
regard to the slope of the driveway due to the steep grade of the property 
at this setback.  The driveway slope is calculated to be 6.15% at our 
requested 65’ setback versus 8.33% at the 120’ setback.  However, the

elevation for the back 55’ of the driveway (from a 65’ to 120’ front setback) 
drops 6’, from 899’ to 893’, creating a 10.91% slope.  Additionally, a 120’ 
setback would put the rear foundation abutting the drainage easement and 
buildable area on the South edge and would cause construction concerns 
by limiting the buildable area behind the house (e.g. patio) (please see 
attached drawings from the surveyor to illustrate the building and grades at 
both a 65’ setback and 120’ setback).  Lastly, in the event that there is a 
berm failure on the detention pond upstream from Lot 12, there are 
concerns that this water may flow down to the pond on Outlot 6.  Placing 
the house at a 120’ setback creates a flooding risk if this pond were to 
overflow (see section 4b-iv of attached the Engineering Department 
Memorandum dated February 25th, 2019 as well as plat drawing of 
detention pond upstream from Lot 12).   
 
 
4. 
Describe what special conditions exist which cause 
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, IF variance is 
NOT 
granted: 
 
There are safety concerns with the steep grade of the driveway, as well as the 
proximity of the pond on the adjacent Outlot 6 to where the back of the house 
would be with our small children.  With the subdivision covenants requiring a 
side-entry 3 car garage, this creates additional challenges with placement of 
the building as it would end up abutting to an underground drainage easement 
to the East as well as putting us right on the edge of the build-able area to the 
South.   
 
 
5. 
Explain why the variance IS NECESSARY for the preservation 
and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by 
other properties in the SAME district: 
 
Allowing for the building closer to the front lot line allows for more distance 
between the back of our house and the building pad on lot 9, thus creating 
more space for privacy and enjoyment for both property owners (see email 
from Lot 9 buyers, Brandon & Elizabeth Helleson). 
 
 
6. 
Explain how this variance, IF granted, WILL NOT create 
substantial detriment to adjacent property, WILL NOT be 
contrary to the public interest and WILL 
NOT 
endanger public 
safety and 
interest: 
 
This variance would still keep the building within all setback requirements for 
Rs-3 zoning thus keeping appropriate boundaries to adjacent properties and 
outlots.  This would not be contrary to public interest and being further from 
the drainage easement and Outlot 6 may increase public safety and interest.

Subject: Woodland Ponds Estates; Lot 10 Setback Issue 
  
I understand that a prospective owner of Lot 10 in the WPE subdivision has questions about the 
minimum 120 feet front/street yard setback as shown on the final plat (attached). 
I believe that there may be some confusion given that the 120 feet setback shown in the final 
plat is different than the list of setbacks presented in the subdivision covenants (draft attached) 
that indicates the front/street yard setback is a minimum 45 feet with reference to the Village’s 
Zoning Code Section 17.16 for the Rs-3 Zoning District that this property is located in. 
The problem is that, on pie-shaped cul-de-sac lots like Lot 10 (as well as Lots 3, 4 and 11), the 
minimum setback is determined based on the width of the lot. The minimum lot width in the Rs-3 
District is 150 feet. For lots that are 150 feet in width or greater, the minimum setback is 45 feet. 
For pie-shaped lots where the front yard abutting the public street is less than 150 feet, the 
minimum setback is measured at the point where the lot widens to 150 feet. NOTE: Lots that 
are less than 150 feet in width are not allowed to be created in the Rs-3 District because of the 
minimum 150 lot width requirement; pie-shaped lots like Lot 10 are only allowed to be created if 
the lot widens to at least 150 feet at some point AND there is an adequate building envelop 
created on the lot that can accommodate the construction of a code-compliant dwelling. 
In the case of Lot 10, the lot widens to 150 feet at a point that is 120 feet setback from the street 
yard property line, and therefore, this point is the minimum front/street yard setback for Lot 10. 
In the event that the owner wants to seek a variance from this setback, they would need to 
apply for said variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals (BOZA) through the Village Clerk’s 
Office. With respect to the typical scenario where one applies for a variance only after first 
having been denied a building permit, I do not see the need for this particular owner to first 
apply for and be denied a building permit for a new dwelling on Lot 10 if the owner understands 
that their variance application contains the necessary information that clearly shows why the 
variance is being requested and why the required setback cannot reasonably be met without the 
variance being granted. That information may very well include some sort of scaled site plan of 
the lot and proposed dwelling. 
As with all variance applications, the owner needs to consider the requirements and criteria that 
the BOZA will use to judge whether or not a variance can/should be granted before submitted 
their application. Seeking a variance is not a “pay-and-go” process that gets approved simply 
because there isn’t/aren’t other property owners who might object. 
Finally, the current owner of the property needs to be the one signing the variance application. 
The prospective owner can be authorized by the owner to act on their behalf and listed as the 
“agent” on the variance application. 
Please feel free to share this email with the prospective owner.

2. Water comments  
a) No comments 
 
3. Highway comments 
a. No comments 
 
4. Engineering comments 
 
a. Storm Water Management Plan Comments 
i. Please provide ditch and culvert sizing calculations.  All ditches and 
culverts are to be sized at a minimum for a 25-year storm.  However, 
all overland flow routes are to be sized for the 100-year event. 
ii. The Village believes the swale between lots 10 and 12 should be 
converted to a drainage pipe.  Runoff from the southeast side of Lot 12 
should still have access to pipe that runs North-South across Lot 10.  
The reason for this suggestion is to prevent future drainage issues that 
have been experienced in similar cases elsewhere in the Village.  
Overland flow paths still need to be accounted for. 
iii. The Village would like clarification for Lot 10 regarding elevations of 
the 15” HDPE drainage pipe and the sanitary sewer lateral running

from the house to mound.  There are concerns about acceptable 
cover, as well as the two lines interfering with each other.  
iv. The Village believes the swale between Lots 4 and 5 should be 
converted to a buried drainage pipe.  The reason for this suggestion is 
to prevent future drainage issues that have been experienced in similar 
cases elsewhere in the Village.  Overland flow paths still need to be 
accounted for. 
v. Pond 2A’s outlet structure and emergency overflow need to be 
redesigned as concentrated flow is proposed to be discharged in to the 
property to the south.  There may be a need to utilize a BMP that 
focuses on volume control. 
vi. Pond 1B and the overflow component that discharges to the south east 
towards the ROW needs to be reviewed for re-positioning the 
discharge further upstream in relation to the wetland (Outlot 3). 
vii. The Village would like clarification on Outlot 4 (To Be Developed In 
Future).  The area is included in the Storm Water Management Plan 
but is not included in the overall grading plan.  Please provide further 
details for the overall plan on Outlot 4. 
viii. The proposed mound location on Lot 4 compromises the overland flow 
route from the wetlands.  The site layout should be modified as the 
current proposed mound location stops natural flow of water draining 
from the north into the wetlands in the south.  
ix. Staff would like to discuss the proposed “Future Ditch Diversion” on 
Elm Lane.   
x. A signed and recorded Storm Water Maintenance Agreement is 
required prior to final approvals.  
b. Grading Plan 
i. Building pad elevations and walkout elevations should be shown on 
the grading plans. 
ii. The proposed private driveway for lots 8 and 9 should be designed to 
accept loads from fire apparatus. 
1. This includes base, pavement thickness and width 
2. Provide for a proper turn-around at the end of the driveway 
3. Verify 100-year floodplain does not overtop access drive 
iii. Some lots have very odd shapes.  How will the lot lines be marked so 
as to prevent builders and homeowners from grading in the 25 foot 
wetland setback? 
iv. Lot 12 is downslope of a detention pond.  The grading plan should take 
into account a certain level of protection if the upstream pond has a 
berm failure. 
v. Recertifications of the ponds, outlet structures and culverts will be 
required prior final approval.  Emergency spillway elevations must be a 
minimum of 1 foot below top of berm elevations. 
c. Erosion Control Plan 
i. A more detailed erosion control plan is required.  Sequencing should 
be a part of the plan.  Silt fence, erosion bales, ditch checks and 
 
 
February 25, 2019

temporary BMP’s are also to be called out on a separate plan sheet.  
Currently this information is spread out on a variety of plan sheets. 
ii. There are some significant slopes on the proposed ditches.  How will 
they be reinforced to prevent erosion? 
iii. If the ponds silt in during site construction, the developer will be 
required to dredge the ponds and certify all pond elevations prior to 
approval. 
d. Sheet C-5 calls for the surface lift of asphalt to be 5LT 58-28 S.  The surface 
lift is to be specified as 4LT 58-28 S. 
e. The village’s surveyor has provided a separate list of comments that also are 
to be addressed prior to final approvals being granted. 
f. All local and state approvals are required prior to work commencing onsite.  It 
is the developer’s responsibility to insure all approvals are obtained prior to 
start of construction.

Re: Lot 10, Woodland Ponds Estates Variance  Appeal
From:  Brandon & Elizabeth Helleson
Date: 4/30/2020
 
 
It has been brought to my attention that Lot 10, which is adjacent to my Lot 9 in the Woodlands Ponds Estates
subdivision, is appealing to the village for a variance in regards to the minimum lot frontage at setback.
 
I have no concerns or objections to them moving their building pad from a 120' front setback to a 65' setback.  This
will actually create additional backyard space between our two building areas thus allowing more privacy for each of
us.  In my opinion this will not pose an issue to any public safety or interest.
