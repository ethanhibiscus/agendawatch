Everything you wanted to know about (rural) broadband (but were afraid to ask) 
Memo prepared for Powhatan County, Virginia

1) What is broadband? 
“Broadband” is short-hand for an “always-on,” high-speed internet connection provided by a 
company known as an “internet service provider” (ISP).1 We say “always-on” to differentiate 
contemporary internet connections from the dial-up era of the 1990s, when a user had to dial a 
telephone number through their computer to connect. Today, the internet comes to us 
uninterrupted and we cannot get “booted off” if someone lifts up a phone receiver. We say 
“high-speed” connection because not all internet connections are technically broadband (see 
below for more on this point). Currently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the 
federal agency in charge of telecommunications, defines a broadband connection as one with a 
minimum download speed of 25 megabits per second (mbps) and a minimum upload speed of 3 
megabits per second (commonly depicted as “25/3”).2 At this speed, someone could stream a 
Netflix movie, while another user on the same network could post Instagram content and 
neither would experience any buffering (slow down). Many people have faster internet 
connections than the minimum threshold. The average fixed download speed in the United 
States in 2018 was 96.25mbps, while the average upload speed was 32.88mbps.3 
 
2) Why is broadband important? 
A high-speed home internet connection is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. This is particularly 
the case as more and more services, from government forms and documents, to homework, 
and commerce, gravitate on-line only. For Americans living in rural communities and who might 
be separated from major cities by a lengthy drive, broadband can mean leveling the economic 
and academic playing fields. It allows people to telecommute/telework, allows for 
telemedicine, and for rural students to take college-prep and AP courses if not offered at their 
local high school.  
 
There are 6 pillars of rural broadband:  
1) Economic development: This includes broadband for business, employment, and real 
estate. Studies demonstrate that broadband is linked to income growth and slowed 
                                                     
 
1 The Congressional Research Service (CRS) defines broadband as:  
provided by a series of technologies (e.g. cable, telephone, wire, fiber, satellite, mobile, fixed wireless) that gives 
users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds necessary to support a number of applications 
including voice communications, entertainment, telemedicine, distance education, telework, ecommerce, civic 
engagement, public safety, and energy conservation. (CRS, 2019)

unemployment rates, and even higher salaries.4 Broadband is crucial in a firms’ decision 
to locate or re-locate to a rural community.5 The Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Council also 
estimates that a fiber-optic connection can raise a home’s value by 3.1%.6 
2) Rural Education: Upwards of 70% of teachers assign homework online, but 15% of 
school-age children lack broadband access.7 FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel has 
called this “the new homework gap.”8 
3) Telehealth: Rural communities suffer from a lack of doctors and health centers. A high-
speed broadband connection can mean the difference between driving to a health 
center or meeting with a healthcare professional virtually at home. This is particularly 
important during a health crisis such as COVID-19.9 
4) Civic Engagement: Broadband access has been proven to improve civic engagement and 
voter turnout.10 
5) Public Safety: First responders need access to broadband as much as civilians do. 
FirstNet is America’s public safety broadband network and is exclusively managed and 
operated by AT&T. Unfortunately, FirstNet is not available everywhere.11 
6) Quality of Life: Broadband can improve quality of life and encourage young people to 
visit and stay in rural communities.12  
 
3) What is the problem? 
There are three major problems with broadband in rural America: many people do not have 
access, we do not know who has access, and it is expensive to roll out. In the first regard, the 
FCC estimates that 26.4% of rural America, or 16.9 million people, lack access to a broadband 
connection of 25/3. 13  This has been proven to be a highly conservative estimate because of 
the way the FCC collects broadband data. The second point is that more accurate studies 
suggest the FCC’s estimates could be off by upwards of 50%.14 A 2017 study by Microsoft, for 
instance, found that half of all Americans, or 162.8 million people, lack access to broadband.15 
Third, many companies are hesitant to roll out broadband to rural America because of a 
perceived lack of return on investment.16

4) Can’t I just use my phone? 
Not all broadband connections are created equal, and your phone’s internet connection is not a 
replacement for a fixed connection. There are six ways Americans access the internet plus two 
technologies in development. Before we begin, it is important to note that even if you have wi-
fi in your home, you probably still have a fixed, wired connection. There is an important 
difference between wi-fi and your cell phone, which we see below. 
 
Digital Subscriber Line or DSL is the most common type of connection in rural America.17 This is 
the connection provided by a traditional telephone company like AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink, 
Windstream or Frontier. While relatively ubiquitous, a DSL connection struggles with speed and 
network congestion. It has a median download and upload speed of 10/1, and the more people 
who use the network, the slower it will get.18 More than this, the signal degrades after about 3 
miles, so the further away you live from an access point, the slower your connection will be.  
 
Cable is the most prominent broadband technology in urban communities, along with most 
towns, and county seats. A cable broadband connection is available to 88.2% of American 
households.19 It is provided by a traditional cable company like Comcast (Xfinity), Charter, or 
Cox. It uses a coaxial cable to connect you to the internet. The benefit of cable is that it is 
pretty fast (a median of 400/20).20 The problems are that it is only available in dense areas, and 
it suffers from network congestion (the more people online at the same time, the slower 
everyone’s service will be).  
 
Fiber is considered the “gold-standard” of broadband connections. It is incredibly fast 
(1000/1000 or 1gigabit per second/1 gigabit per second). A fiber optic cable is a glass filament 
that transmits data through light pulses. Fiber can be provided by any company, large and 
small, including AT&T and Verizon (Fios), and Ting. Many telephone and electric cooperatives, 
like Central Virginia Electric Cooperative (CVEC), are rolling out fiber to rural America.21 CVEC’s 
fiber optic broadband is called “Firefly.”22 Fiber can handle a near unlimited amount of data 
and users, but the problem is that it is expensive to lay down (about $27,000 per mile), and as 
such many companies do not want to invest in its deployment without a guaranteed return on 
investment – something that is difficult to achieve in rural America. 
 
Fixed wireless, provided by a wireless internet service provider (WISP) is a wireless internet 
connection that originates with a tower that transmits connectivity to the user using radio 
waves. Often times, the tower itself is connected to the network (or another tower) using a 
fiber or DSL wire, but sometimes through a microwave transmission. Fixed wireless has proven 
beneficial for rural and remote America because one tower can transmit a signal as far as 10

miles.23 WISPs include Wisper, Rise, King Street, and Agile. Some WISPs, like MonkeyBrains in 
San Francisco, even operate in major cities.  Many ISPs are using fixed wireless as an interim 
solution before complete fiber-to-the-home deployment because a fiber optic cable can be 
connected to a tower and the signal transmitted wirelessly. The drawbacks of fixed wireless 
include potentially slower service, the need for line-of-sight, network congestion, inclement 
weather, and equipment costs.24  
 
Satellite internet, provided by either ViaSat or Hughes, is available to roughly 99% of the 
American population. Many in rural America subscribe to satellite internet. The problem is that 
satellite connections are notoriously slow (around 2/1.3), and are plagued by high prices, low 
data caps (meaning that you cannot use a lot of data-intensive applications), high latency 
(meaning a lot of lag between transmission and reception) and weather disruptions.25 Many 
have argued that satellite should not be included in the list of viable broadband technologies 
but the FCC has disagreed.26  
 
Mobile broadband is available to the 81% of the population who own a smartphone. This 
service is provided by any of the mobile providers such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile/Sprint, US 
Cellular, Boost, etc… Only 71% of rural Americans have a smartphone, however.27 While 
convenience is certainly a factor, mobile broadband is not a substitute for a fixed connection.28 
4G availability (the speed necessary to stream video) is not universally available, and most 
phones come with either data caps or data throttling.29 Data caps become more severe if trying 
to turn a phone into a “hotspot” to connect other devices. This is troubling with for the 20% of 
rural Americans who access the internet solely with their mobile device. 
 
5G is the next generation of mobile connectivity, capable of supporting multiple devices and 
users with blazing fast upload and download speeds. The “G” in 5G refers to generation, with 
every generation of mobile connectivity we can do more, from texting (2G) to emails and text-
based surfing (3G) to streaming video (4G LTE) to connecting our entire homes to the internet 
(5G). Currently, 5G is only being rolled out in selective areas – densely packed (and wealthy) 
urban centers.30 In addition, not all 5G is equal.31 To access the high speeds mentioned in 
advertisements, one needs a 5G enabled phone and a provider using so called “high band” 
frequencies (also known as millimeter waves). These radio waves can handle an incredible 
amount of information at incredible speeds (1gig/1gig), but they cannot travel far (only 800-
1500 feet).32 As such they require signal repeaters called “small cells.” Because so many small

cells need to be deployed and require a fiber optic connection, and because of their high cost 
and the sparse population, this type of 5G is not feasible for rural America. Low-band 
frequencies, such as those used by T-Mobile, are considered 5G, and travel further than high-
band, but from the user’s perspective, it will only be a small upgrade from their 4G 
connection.33 
 
Low Earth Orbital Satellites (LEOs) are being touted as the next generation of connectivity by 
companies like SpaceX and Amazon.34 In theory, these satellites, which sit closer to earth than 
traditional satellites, can deliver fiber-like speeds with minimal latency, compared to their 
geostationary counterparts. This is all still in development, however, and its success and 
applicability to rural America is yet to be determined.  
 
5) Why don’t I have broadband? 
According to the Pew Foundation, 24% of rural Americans say access to fast, reliable broadband 
is a major problem in their communities.35 There are many reasons why rural Americans do not 
have broadband. The foremost of these is that broadband is simply unavailable where they live. 
This is because private providers refuse to connect these communities or to upgrade their 
connections because of a perceived lack of return on investment. Where broadband is 
available, many rural Americans do not have competition in providers.36 Moreover, where 
broadband is available in rural areas, only 63% of people actually subscribe, suggesting a gap 
between access and adoption.37 Cost is also major factor. The least dense areas of the United 
States pay upwards of 37% more for broadband than the densest centers.38 The lowest income 
households tend not have a home broadband subscription39 citing price as the problem.40  
 
6) How do I get broadband? 
In the absence of a provider offering high-performance broadband in your area, many rural 
communities have turned to their electric or telephone cooperative.41 Almost all of the 260 
telephone cooperatives across the country offer broadband, while over 100 of the 900+ electric 
cooperatives do so.42 Hundreds of communities have also started funding their own broadband 
projects. A few have also become ISPs in their own right, while other municipalities and 
counties have funded or partially funded their broadband networks and then let ISPs manage

and operate the network.43 Unfortunately, at least 19 states have either prohibited or inhibited 
municipalities from funding and operating broadband networks.44 
 
7) What’s next? 
In 2019, the FCC announced a $20.4 billion fund for rural broadband deployment.45 This 
program comes with some hurdles, including the prohibition of communities who have 
received state and/or USDA Re-connect grants and loans from participating.46 Dozens of US 
senators are protesting this restrictive decision.47 It also is not clear how much this fund will 
help in the deployment of next generation connectivity, like fiber.48 
 
The FCC has also announced the creation of a new $5 billion rural 5G fund. This is in addition to 
the $1.4 billion in loans and grants for rural broadband deployment offered by USDA. 
Communities, however, should first determine their local broadband needs and options before 
applying for these funds to make sure they are competitive. There are a number of terrific 
organizations that can help with these broadband plans and community assessments.49  
 
Members of rural communities and counties should also consider speaking with their Boards of 
Supervisors to encourage the development of a broadband plan, and to look into public-private 
partnerships with incumbent ISPs, cooperatives, and/or competitive network builders. Many 
states have begun to permit cooperatives to offer broadband, which expands the number of 
providers dramatically. Virginia is a state that has some inhibitions against municipalities 
funding broadband projects, but has no prohibitions or inhibitions against cooperatives doing 
so. Community members should also consider speaking with their state and federal 
representatives to make sure that their interests are being met in federal policies, such as 
broadband mapping.50  
 
There is no “cookie-cutter” solution to the rural-urban digital divide. Instead, it will take an all-
hands-on-deck approach that must begin and end with communities themselves.
