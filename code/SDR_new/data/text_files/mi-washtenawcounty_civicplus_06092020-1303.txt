Public Comment
Jack Smiley stated that he wanted to speak in support of the Highland Cemetery acquisition and added 
that it’s an important link in the greenway corridor.  He added that a seven mile long continuous trail 
could be completed in the long term.   
Matt Grocoff stated that he was alerted that the Commission was constructing a building that included 
gas infrastructure.  He added that the building cannot happen if it isn’t an all-electric building.  Mr. 
Grocoff stated that he was present when the WCBOC declared a climate emergency.  He added that the 
building would immediately be shifted into the retrofit category as soon as it’s built and cannot happen 
because it’s cheaper to build it as an all-electric building.  He asked that the architect reach out to him 
directly.

Communications, Projects & Activities 
 
Mr. Vaughn presented the Communications and the Projects & Activities report for April 2020 and briefly 
discussed the one news article included in the packet 
 
Jason Gold of the Michigan Folk School presented a video and discussed activities of the Michigan Folk 
School.  He stated that the Folk School had been growing more quickly than anticipated prior to the virus 
shut down.  He stated that revival as a non-profit right now is very difficult and added that it was a natural 
idea to merge with Washtenaw County Parks.  He reported that a little under 40% of participants come 
from within the County, 17% are from out of state and the remainder are from other places in the State of 
Michigan.   
 
Ms. Anschuetz asked about the potential timeframe for this acquisition were to occur.  Mr. Gold reported 
that he was looking at up to two years and added that going slow is better than jumping right into it to 
ensure we get everything right.  Mr. Vaughn stated that next steps would be setting up a subcommittee to 
develop a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to explore this further.  Mr. Marans asked what Mr. 
Vaughn sees down the line as far as financial obligations.  Mr. Vaughn reported that the financial 
obligations need to be explored further and added that he believes the Folk School has shown that they 
can be a financially sustainable operation.  Ms. Bobrin stated that she feels that the Folk School is a 
great concept and added that she appreciates the long timeline. She added that she would like to see 
some numbers before talking about spending staff time on a serious study.  Ms. Fuller stated that at this 
point she has great reluctance to acquire the Folk School.  She added that she doesn’t believe that the 
County needs to become a tourist destination on the backs of the taxpayers.  Ms. Fuller reported that she 
doesn’t yet feel as though she has enough information to weigh in on next steps.  Mr. Vaughn reported 
that a presentation to continue the discussion could potentially be done in June.  Ms. Bonfiglio reported 
that the August meeting may be more realistic.

Old Business
A. PLGC Cart Path Paving Contract 
Mr. Vaughn reported that many of the cart paths at Pierce Lake Golf Course are starting to show their 
age.  He reported that this project has been delayed in the past because bids that came in previously 
were more than 60% over budget.  Mr. Vaughn reported that this round, we received two bids and that 
there was a big gap between the two bidders.  He added that due diligence was done and reference 
checks were done on Anglin.  He added that work would include the entry drive and maintenance parking 
lots. 
It was moved by Mr. Pratt and seconded by Ms. Fuller to award a service contract in the amount of 
$1,238,143.25 to Anglin Civil, LLC for the work identified in RFP #7862 and as modified with authorized 
change orders at Pierce Lake Golf Course and include an additional 15% ($186,000) contingency for 
potential change orders.  Roll call vote: 10 Ayes, 0 Nays, the motion was approved. 
B. NAPP – Poulter Sales Contract 
Ms. Trocchio reported that this is the item that was reviewed last month and that we are ready to move 
forward with a sales contract.  She presented the prioritization chart and indicated that the property 
scores on the higher end.   
Mr. Ezekiel asked if there was a plan for the tiny hanger.  Ms. Trocchio reported that there wasn’t but that 
it needed to be taken account in the conservation easement.   
It was moved by Ms. Scribner and seconded by Ms. Shink to authorize preparation of a sales contract in 
the amount of $972,000 as outlined in the table above for the purchase of a conservation easement on 
the Poulter farm in Dexter Township, contingent upon completion of all necessary due diligence 
investigation and final approval by the Parks and Recreation Commission.  Roll call vote: 9 Ayes, 1 Nays 
(Fuller), the motion was approved. 
C. Summer 2020 Opening/Operations Plan 
Mr. Vaughn and Ms. Bonfiglio provided a presentation on opening plans and communications that we 
have utilized.  Facilities/operations in the presentation included Pierce Lake Golf Course, Rolling Hills, 
Staebler Farm County Park, Independence Lake, Maintenance and Stewardship and Day Camps.  Ms. 
McKinney expressed concern that it may be too risky to have day camp this summer.   
It was moved by Ms. Bobrin and seconded by Ms. Fuller to approve the parks and facility opening plan 
outlined above for the summer of 2020 pending any changing details and additionally to cancel summer 
day camps at all facilities.  Roll call vote: 10 Ayes, 0 Nays, the motion was approved. 
D. Project Updates 
Ms. Bonfiglio and Mr. Vaughn provided updates on the Ypsilanti Township Skatepark, M-52 Tunnel 
Project and the Staebler Farm Multipurpose building.  Mr. Marans asked when we could go out for bid.  
Mr. Vaughn stated that we could be flexible and bring it to the Commission in August with the project 
commencing in spring.  Ms. Bobrin stated that she wanted to look at the entire park system when 
constructing the Staebler multipurpose building.  She added that she sees no need to hurry the building 
along.  Ms. Anschuetz stated that we try to be environmentally conscious of what we do and thanked Mr. 
Vaughn for his comments.

New Business
A. NAPP – Highland Cemetery Sales Contract 
Ms. Pahl-Donaldson stated that this property is the highest scoring property we have had in a while.  She 
added that this land is mostly in Ypsilanti Township and stated that the property has never been used as 
a cemetery.  Ms. Pahl-Donaldson stated that the frontage is on Clark Rd. and added that the property is 
very near the Huron River and that long term hopes are for a connection to Highland Preserve.  She 
added that it’s about 20.5 acres in total.   
It was moved by Ms. Anschuetz and seconded by Ms. Shink to authorize preparation of a sales contract 
to purchase the Highland Cemetery property in Ypsilanti Township and the City of Ypsilanti as identified 
in the attached maps at a purchase price of $519,000, contingent upon completion of all necessary due 
diligence investigation and final approval by the Parks and Recreation Commission.  Roll call vote: 10 
Ayes, 0 Nays, the motion was approved.

exclusion the way we think about it, there is a separate tax parcel. 
It was moved by Ms. Shink and seconded by Ms. McKinney to partner with Ann Arbor Township for the 
purchase of a conservation easement on the Stiles-Kaldjian 2 property in Ann Arbor Township and 
contribute $60,000 toward the purchase, and a contribution of $7,500 to the stewardship special

conservation easement, contingent upon attorney review of documents and execution of participation 
agreement.  Roll call vote: 10 Ayes, 0 Nays, the motion was approved.

8. Director/Commissioners Comments
Mr. Vaughn stated that he would like to discuss the letter with Mr. Smiley on wetland banking.  He 
reported that he discussed this matter with Mr. Smiley today.  Ms. Trocchio reported that she has been in 
touch with Jo Louis, of the Southeast Michigan Land Conservancy.  She added that there is no specific site 
plan yet.  She reported that she has been in touch with the attorney regarding whether there are 
violations.  Ms. McKinney thanked Ms. Trocchio for looking into this issue.  She asked if it is okay to say 
that this is in the beginning stages.  Ms. Trocchio stated that she would be happy to prepare a response to 
provide.  Ms. Anschuetz stated that Mr. Smiley is talking about a for-profit entity.  Ms. Trocchio reported 
that wetland mitigation projects have been done on the property.  Mr. Vaughn stated that Mr. Smiley is 
4
 
concerned that the work being done is not appropriate for this site and that this project includes too much 
grading.  Ms. Fuller stated that she doesn’t understand the wetland mitigation bank concept well but 
would object to a private company coming in and using the public property to make a profit.  She added 
that she would appreciate clarification when this comes back.  Mr. Pratt reported that wetland banking is a 
requirement to compensate/mitigate for disturbing property.  He stated that the pros are that there are 
larger areas of wetlands and better site selection.  Mr. Ezekiel thanked Mr. Vaughn and Ms. Trocchio for 
looking into this issue and he added that he is aware that created wetlands can work but that we should 
take Mr. Smiley’s word seriously.   
Mr. Vaughn reported that he spoke with the head of the Ann Arbor YMCA for an update.  He stated that it 
took a setback when the COVID-19 situation arose and added that fundraising and community 
engagement has dropped off.  Mr. Vaughn stated that work was anticipated through the spring/summer to 
have a building concept which could be used to raise money starting in the fall.  He reported that this has 
now been pushed back to the spring.  Mr. Vaughn stated that three committees have been established 
focusing on private fundraising, program/design of the building, and the community voice.  He reported 
that those committees would kick off at that point.  Ms. Fuller asked which commissioners are on these 
committees.  Mr. Vaughn stated that he is not sure if committee placement is official at this point.  Mr. 
Jefferson stated that meetings have not yet taken place after the hiring of consultants.   
Ms. Anschuetz stated that the proposed nature preserve at Highland Cemetery will be the most 
spectacular one we have had.   
Ms. Fuller stated that she would like to underscore that the facility plans and closing of day camps was a 
very tough call.  She added that she is not sure how an organization can step in to meet the need while 
keeping the kids safe.   
Mr. Ezekiel stated that he echoes the comments of Ms. Fuller and added that it was the toughest vote he 
has taken. 
Mr. Jefferson stated that he agrees and that he hopes we can come together to make future plans. 
Mr. Pratt stated that he agreed.  He added that Mr. Kidder paid $350,000 for the property we just paid 
$351,000 for earlier this meeting.   
Ms. Shink stated that voting that we are not going to have day camps was incredibly hard because she 
worries about the kids but added that she does not want to see them get sick.  She added that she would 
like to thank Parks staff for planning for all of the contingencies. 
Ms. Scribner stated that she wants us to have the healthiest county in the state and that this was a 
difficult vote and added that she hopes that staff can come up with clever alternatives to camps. 
Mr. Marans stated that he wanted to offer assistance and stated the staff could help with putting together 
a summary to distribute and a press release discussing why the camps have been closed this summer.   
9. Adjournment
It was moved by Ms. Bobrin and seconded by Mr. Pratt to adjourn the meeting. Ayes all; the motion was 
approved.

Rolling Hills Water Park and Blue Heron Bay will both be closed for the summer. Blue Heron
was already going to be closed this year due to infrastructure issues, but the decision to
close Rolling Hills was based on concerns about social distancing at a water park, oﬃcials
said.
“The safety and well-being of our patrons is always our most important consideration. We
explored multiple avenues of getting the facility open for the season, but in each scenario,
we were unable to ensure the safety of our staff and guests,” said Rhonda Bouma,
superintendent at Rolling Hills County Park.
Also, day camp programs at Rolling Hills, Independence Lake, the Meri Lou Murray
Recreation Center and the Ypsilanti-based Playground Camp are all canceled.
Those who have already registered for the camps will receive a full refund or credit for the
2021 season.
Washtenaw County Parks staff are currently working on developing virtual programs and
resources for campers. They anticipate the launch of some of these programs and resources
by June 15 and will be offering opportunities to engage with camp curriculum throughout the
summer.

Ypsilanti
Ypsi-area summer camps retool
offerings in response to COVID-19
SARAH RIGG | TUESDAY, MAY 19, 2020
Ypsilanti YMCA Summer Day Camp, 2019.
Ann Arbor YMCA
10
Directors of Ypsilanti-area summer camps have choices to make during the uncertainty 
of the COVID-19 pandemic: cancel, go virtual, or host smaller in-person camps with 
safety precautions. 
 
The staff at Ypsi's Parkridge Community Center recently decided they will offer summer 
programming virtually, though Community Development Manager Anthony Williamson 
says staff aren't sure what that will look like yet. He notes that the population served by 
Parkridge summer programs is already marginalized, and summer programming helps 
them retain academic gains from the previous school year, so it's important that staff 
provide some sort of "vigorous virtual camp."
 
The Washtenaw County Parks and Recreation Commission has already canceled all of 
its summer playground camps for 2020, including those held in Ypsi and Ypsi Township.
 
Karen Lewis, director of the county's summer playground program, says the 
commissioners considered hosting a smaller summer camp with social distancing 
protocols but decided "it was not in the best interest of the safety and health of the 
children."
 
"We started listing the pros and cons, and there started to be more cons than pros 
because there are so many unknowns," Lewis says. 
 
Instead, the county is working on providing free books and box lunches for Ypsi-area 
children to ¦ll some of the needs that free summer camps typically meet.
 
The parks and recreation commissioners also considered pivoting to some sort of 
virtual programming, but it didn't seem like the right ¦t for the demographic served by 
the county's summer camp program, which provides a form of childcare for many of the 
families who participate.
 
"We discussed what this population needed, and they don't need virtual classes," Lewis 
says. "If their parents are going back to work, what they need is adult supervision."
 
The camps' role as child care providers is one reason Ann Arbor YMCA staff are hoping 
to still host in-person summer camps in 2020, with smaller groups and social distancing 
protocols.
11
Toni Kayumi, Ann Arbor YMCA president and CEO, says hosting camps this year will be 
a challenge since the Y will have to be careful to follow national, state, and local safety 
and health guidance.
"We're still hoping to be able to run in-person day camp in smaller numbers, because the 
space requirements for six-foot distancing will mean we can serve fewer campers in the 
same amount of space," she says. "But we know it's a high priority for working parents 
to have a safe and enriching place for students to go so they can be back on the job."
She says that unless the Washtenaw County Health Department, CDC, or state guidance 
forbid them from having summer camps, YMCA staff tentatively plan to host a summer 
day camp for 5- to 12-year-olds at the Ypsilanti Township Community Center from 8:30 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each weekday from July 6 to Aug. 21. Kayumi believes they can safely 
host about 12 to 16 children per week at the community center.
She says there'll be "fewer spaces, less places we can go," and fewer types of camps 
while maintaining social distancing. Other protocols will include daily temperature 
checks for staff and campers; not offering shared supplies, so that multiple children 
won't be touching the same crayons, for instance; and possibly having campers wear 
masks.
"We want them to have new experiences and develop friendships, which is key if kids 
are isolated … and haven't been able to play with other kids in person," she says. 
Though the camps might not be able to offer certain sports and group activities, they 
can still offer arts and crafts, science projects, team building, nutritional education, and 
silent reading time.
The Y is also working on offering virtual programming for older teens and hosting Y on 
the Fly check-ins at various neighborhood centers, parks, and churches. The Y on the Fly 
program brings sports equipment and activity coaches to children in underserved 
neighborhoods. Y staff are also working on activity kits for children who can't attend an 
in-person camp.
"We know that families might be tired of doing virtual stuff for months, so we created a 
'camp in a box' program to allow kids to have enriching, theme-based things to do," 
Kayumi says. Youth can do most of the activities with little or no adult supervision.

SPONSORED BY
Kayumi and her staff are waiting to see what kind of o¨cial guidance will shape this 
year's programming, and making their best guesses in the meantime.
 
"We're trying to keep the spirit of day camp alive, while also following all safety and 
health protocols at a much higher level of restriction than in years past," Kayumi says.

Re: 
Superior Township Utility Easement Request 
Background 
The 53-acre property in Superior Township, now known as Highland Preserve, was nominated for 
consideration by the Natural Areas Preservation Program and was subsequently purchased in 2017.  
The property has a variety of landforms and characteristics including meadow and remnant prairie 
habitats as well as a small portion of older, mature woodland.  The property is located near the 
southern edge of the Superior Greenway, the growing expanse of protected land in Superior Township 
on the Eastern edge of Washtenaw County. Currently no parking lot or formal access has been 
developed for the preserve.  In May 2020, the Commission approved a sales contract with the 
Highland Cemetery property, across Clark Road, which will provide additional connectivity with the 
Superior Greenway. 
Discussion 
Superior Township approached WCPARC requesting a utility easement along Clark Road to relocate 
a sanitary pump station on the property owned by Washtenaw County Parks.  There are existing utility 
easements on the property. As part of the construction of the sanitary pump station, Superior 
Township will provide landscaping to surround and screen the pump station and a 6-car gravel lot off 
of Clark Road.  A schematic drawing is attached to this memo, as well as, survey drawing of the utility 
easement.  The location of the pump station was identified to minimize impact on the natural features 
of the site and is in an area that was historically used for an access to the site.  Superior Township has 
received necessary permits from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy 
(EGLE) for the construction of the station and access.  
Recommendation 
Based on staff review of the site plan for the utility easement and construction of the sanitary pump 
station, it is my recommendation that the Washtenaw County Parks and Recreation Commission 
authorize the execution of the utility easement contingent upon attorney approval of final documents.

Re: 
WCPARC Support of Eastside Recreation Facilities  
Background 
In 2017, the Washtenaw County Parks and Recreation Commission (WCPARC) authorized a three year 
(2017, 2018, and 2019) financial commitment to the City of Ypsilanti to support recreational activities 
at the Rutherford Pool, Partridge Community Center and the Ypsilanti Senior Center.  This commitment 
provided funding in the amount of $10,000 per year for each of these City-owned facilities for a period 
of three years ($90,000 total). 
Historically, the City of Ypsilanti was able keep these three important community facilities open and 
viable, but due to ongoing financial constraints the necessary resources are no longer available. 
Through this partnership with the City, WCPARC is able to help keep these important facilities in 
operation and the recreation programming available to the greater Ypsilanti Community.  The services 
provided at these facilities are especially important this year considering the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.   
On June 3rd, the City of Ypsilanti submitted a request to extend the funding commitment for three 
additional years (2020-2022). 
Recommendation 
Through ongoing support of partner organizations and investing in recreation programming, WCPARC 
can continue to have a significant impact on the greater Ypsilanti Community.  I recommend that the 
Commission authorize a $90,000 funding commitment over the next three years to support the 
Rutherford Pool, The Parkridge Community Center, and the Ypsilanti Senior Center.

RE:  Request for Renewal of Programming Support for Parkridge Community Center, Senior Center, and 
Rutherford Pool 
Dear Mr Vaughn: 
Since 2017, the Commission has generously supported the Parkridge Community Center, the Ypsilanti 
Senior Center, and the Rutherford Pool with contributions of $10,000 annually for each entity, totaling 
$90,000 for the past three years. We ask that the Commission consider renewing this support. 
The WCPRC’s investment has helped ensure that at-risk children in Ypsilanti’s low-income neighborhoods 
have after school programming, meal service in the summer and during the recent pandemic, summer 
programming, and a safe space to spend time with strong role models from the community. It helps to 
ensure that elderly Ypsilanti community members have hot lunches each day during the week, a low-
cost, accessible place to socialize with their peers and receive medical services, and a lifeline to services, 
friends, and food during the pandemic. It helps to ensure that the Rutherford Pool can renovate and 
reopen, providing low-cost recreation for thousands, and water safety training and swimming lessons for 
hundreds of people during the summer. These community centers are vital anchors in our community. 
The City, the Centers, and the Pool all actively seek out funding resources on an ongoing basis.  This 
includes tapping resources small and large, from Land and Water Conservation Grants to community corn 
roasts and children’s triathalons. Some programming is supported in whole or in part by user fees, but 
due to populations they serve and the services provided, these user fees must be supplemented with 
other sources. The City’s budget is still unable to support these facilities to the extent needed, and due to 
the unpredictable budget effects of COVID-19, is projected to remain unable to support them for some 
time.  
Please feel free to call me at 734-483-1810 or e-mail me at fmcmullan@cityofypsilanti.com with any 
questions.   
Sincerely, 
Frances M. McMullan
