Mayor and City Council 
From:  
 
Frank Jenkins Jr., City Attorney 
Date:

June 11, 2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Formal Item:  Consider adoption of Charter Ordinance No.________ exempting the City from 
K.S.A. 79-41a04(d) relating to the Local Alcoholic Liquor Fund.  The purpose of the exemption 
is to enable the City to subsequently adopt a regular ordinance on the same subject matter 
including substitute provisions to apply specifically to Spring Hill.   
 
Issue:  Expanding the authorized uses of the tax revenues from the Local Alcoholic Liquor Fund.  
 
Background:  
 
1. In 1979, the Legislature imposed a 10% tax on gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic 
liquor.  Drinking establishments, caterers and temporary permit holders collect the tax 
and remit it to the Department of Revenue.  The State returns 70% of the money to the 
localities where the money was collected.   
 
2. The City is to deposit the full amount of its share of the taxes into the following funds: 
 
 
A. 1/3 – General Fund 
B. 1/3 – Special parks and recreation fund 
C. 1/3 – Special alcohol and drug programs fund 
 
3. With respect to the Special alcohol and drug programs fund (Item 2(C)), K.S.A. 79-
41a04(d) limits the use of the funds as follows:  
 
“Moneys in the special alcohol and drug programs fund shall be expended 
only for the purchase, establishment, maintenance or expansion of service 
or programs whose principal purpose is alcohol and drug abuse or 
treatment of persons who are alcoholics or drug abuser or are in danger 
becoming alcoholic or drug abuser.” 
 
Analysis:   
 
The City Staff has determine that in order to provide greater flexibility regarding the use of the 
special alcohol and drug programs fund, City Staff recommends that the Governing Body 
consider adopting an ordinance that would include additional programs and services.   
 
2 
 
To accomplish this objective, the following is the two-step process: 
 
1. Charter Ordinance.  The City would adopt a Charter Ordinance that exempts the City 
from K.S.A. 79-41a04(d).  A Charter Ordinance is different from a regular ordinance 
in the following ways:  
 
A. Ordinance is to be approved by a 2/3 vote of the Governing Body, which 
includes the Mayor.  
B. Ordinance is published twice.  
C. Ordinance does not become effective until 61 days after the last publication 
date.  
D. Ordinance is subject to the filing of a referendum protest petition.  If the 
petition is sufficient, the ordinance will only become effective upon approval 
by a majority of the electors.  
 
        Attached is a copy of the proposed Charter Ordinance (Exhibit A). 
 
2. Regular Ordinance.  During the 61-day waiting period, City Staff would prepare and 
present a regular ordinance for consideration to the Governing Body that would 
contain substitute or additional provisions to the Local Alcohol Liquor Fund statute.   
 
Recommendation:  Adoption of Charter Ordinance No. _________.

Formal Action:  Annexation Ordinance No. 2020-____ authorizing the annexation of 
land located at the southwest corner of 201st Street and Webster Street.  
 
Issue: Greg Prieb, II, owner, has petitioned for annexation of the property located at the 
southwest corner 201st Street and Webster Street, known as 20110 Webster Street.  
 
Background:  The tract of land being requested for annexation is adjoining to the city 
limits and is eligible for annexation under Kansas State Law. The owner has signed the 
“Petition and Consent for Annexation”. 
 
Analysis:  Annexation of this property is desirable to both the owner and city. From the 
owner’s point of view, it will allow for future development on the property.  The City 
will gain tax value, and partially fill in an area that is currently surrounded by the city 
limits.  According to state statute, property annexed into a city is zoned in a district that is 
similar to existing county zoning.  This property will be zoned R-R which is compatible 
with the surrounding area. 
 
Alternatives:  Denial of the annexation 
 
Legal Review:  City Attorney Frank Jenkins has reviewed the documents submitted for 
annexation. 
 
Funding Review or Budgetary Impact:   
 
Recommendation:  Staff recommends adoption of annexation ordinance #

TO:  GOVERNING BODY 
SUBMITTED BY: PATRICK BURTON, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
MEETING DATE:  JUNE 11, 2020 
DATE:  JUNE 4, 2020 
 
Formal Agenda:  Site Plan, Spring Hill Middle School #3, SP-000011-2020 
 
Issue: School District USD 230 has submitted a final site plan application for Spring 
Hill Middle School #3. 
 
BACKGROUND:  The applicant USD230 working with the design team lead by the DLR 
Group, has submitted an application for site plan approval for a middle school to be located 
at 18685 W. 191st St., at approximately 191st Street and Ridgeview Rd.  The project consists 
of a middle school building, bus drop-off, parking, sports activity area and storm water 
detention.  The complete site plan is included with this staff report. 
 
Analysis: (See attached staff report, PC minutes, site plan drawing) The Spring Hill 
Planning Commission reviewed the site plan application at their May 7, 2020 meeting.  
Following the presentation of the staff report, the PC discussed the volume of traffic that 
would be turning off Ridgeview onto 192nd and 193rd Streets going to the proposed 
Middle School.  The traffic study summary states, “it is expected that the three 
intersections analyzed as part of this study will operate acceptably without additional 
lanes in the Full Build scenario”.  After deliberation about the traffic study and the need 
to improve 199th St., 191st St. and Ridgeview Rd., the Planning Commission voted 
unanimously to recommend approval of the site plan with an amendment / addition of a 
turn lane be constructed on Ridgeview.  This additional lane would be utilized by the 
traffic traveling north on Ridgeview that will be turning west on 192nd and 193rd Streets. 
A turn lane exhibit and a cost analysis are attached. 
  With the construction of the round about at 199th and Ridgeview, City Staff is 
composing a proposed capital improvement project to improve 191st Street from 
Woodland to Ridgeview Rd., Ridgeview Rd. from 191st to 199th and 199th from Skyview 
Lane to South Renner Road.  Community Development Department anticipates these 
improvements would start with-in 5 years.  The school district has expressed willingness 
to participate in improving the road system. Staff believes the district has proposed a very 
realistic site plan, that will have a positive impact on the area and complement the other 2 
school sites that are in proximity of the proposed Middle School site. 
  
Alternatives:  Approval, denial, table, or remand to the PC for further study 
 
Legal Review:  N/A  
 
Funding Review or Budgetary Impact:  N/A 
 
 
 
A G E N D A   I T E M   R E V I E W   S H E E T  
 
Recommendation:  The Spring Hill Planning Commission recommends approval of 
Spring Hill Middle School #3, SP-000011-2020, site plan, including the addition of a turn 
lane be constructed on Ridgeview from just south of 193rd St. to just north of 192nd Street.

BACKGROUND:  The applicant, USD 230 thru their design team, the DLR Group, has 
submitted an application for site plan approval for a proposed building identified as the 
Spring Hill Middle School.  The project consists of a middle school building, bus drop-off, 
parking, sports activity area and storm water detention. 
 
As per Section 17.308.C.3, schools are allowed in an RP-4 (Planned Multi-Family) 
district with an approved Conditional Use Permit.  This site is regulated under a 
Conditional Use Permit that will be presented at the June Planning Commission meeting. 
 
STAFF REVIEW: 
Staff has reviewed the site plan under the requirements of Section 17.340 of the Spring 
Hill Zoning Ordinance as follows: 
 
1. All existing structures with applicable data are identified. 
 
2. The pavement plan adequately identifies all paved areas including drive entrance, 
parking and traffic flow lanes. 
 
3. The traffic impact study recommends minimal improvements to 191st Street by 
adding turn lanes and turn lanes to 193rd Street at Ridgeview. 
 
4. Parking spaces provided are compliant with regulations including accessible 
spaces. 
 
5. The plan identifies appropriate sidewalks connecting to 193rd, 192nd, and up to 
191st Street. 
  
6. There is exterior lighting shown for parking and drive areas.  Staff has reviewed the 
photometric plans and study. The offsite light disbursement shows a minimal 
impact on the surrounding areas and is within acceptable limits.  Shielding on the 
light fixtures will be utilized to reduce the glare where applicable.  Photometric is 
also provided for the sports area to show minimal impact surrounding areas.  
 
7. City Staff will work with the District to ensure minimal noise pollution will occur with 
the use of the sports broadcast system.  
 
8. Landscaping, existing and proposed is identified on the overall landscape plan and 
complies with regulations. Existing trees and green space on the west property 
boundary will remain as identified on the plans.  To enhance the visual buffer from 
residential properties, additional landscaping will be installed on the south side of 
the property as identified.  
 
9. Utilities are identified and in compliance with regulations. 
 
10. Adequate erosion and pollution control systems are identified. 
 
11. The site plan was sent out to City Staff and consultants for review. The review 
comments from the government agencies, consultants and utility providers will be 
implemented as applicable on revised plan if necessary. The applicant and their 
engineer have agreed to address provided comments.   
 
 
12. The storm water study for the improvements resulted in proposed construction of 
 
 
Agenda item 2 
7 
 
6/5/2020 
two detention basins to be provided to the west side of the property.  
 
13. The site layout and the building are designed to help protect the views from the 
adjacent residential housing district. 
 
 
In addition to the above noted items the site plan has been reviewed for compliance with 
the following standards: 
 
1. 
The extent to which the proposal conforms to the provisions of the Code. 
The proposed improvements to the property are in compliance with the Code.  
 
2. 
The extent to which the proposal conforms to the provisions of the Spring Hill 
Subdivision Regulations. 
 
Schools are allowed in residential districts with an approved Conditional Use 
Permit (CUP) that will be reviewed for renewal as previously determined.  
 
3. 
The extent to which the development would be compatible with the surrounding area. 
   
Thee has been an elementary school in the surrounding area for several years.  
The school is compatible with the future land use map.  It is staff’s opinion the 
applicant has been very cognizant and considerate of the adjoining residential 
development and has designed the project to protect the property values, lines 
of sight and overall appearance of the project from the adjoining development.   
 
4. 
The extent to which the proposal conforms to the recommendations of the Spring Hill  
Comprehensive Plan including but not limited to the Vision Plan, the Community 
Development Recommendations, and the Planning and Principles and Design 
Guidelines. 
Appendix E of the Spring Hill Comprehensive Plan addresses the school 
district’s growth potential and scenarios to adequately provide facilities to 
accommodate this growth.  As the population grows, the facility’s needs and 
uses are vital in the quest to provide proper education and services for the 
residents.  
   
5. 
The extent to which the proposal conforms to customary engineering standards used 
in the City. 
 
 
The proposed improvements have been designed by recognized and 
 
 
 licensed architects and engineers. 
 
6. 
The extent to which the location of streets, paths, walkways, and driveways are 
located so as to enhance safety and minimize any adverse impact on parking and 
entering the building. 
 
Provisions and recommendations of the traffic impact study will be 
implemented into the design of the project to minimize any adverse impact on 
the property and adjoining properties.

1 Introduction 
 
1.1 Project Description 
Renaissance Infrastructure Consulting (RIC) has completed the following Traffic Impact Study 
(TIS) and documents the assumptions, methodology, and analysis results for traffic conditions 
associated with the proposed development west of Ridgeview Road and south of 191st Street in 
Spring Hill, Kansas. The purpose of this analysis is to assess the impact of a proposed middle 
school development on the surrounding transportation system. To evaluate the increase of traffic 
on adjacent streets, the number of trips were estimated for the morning and afternoon peak time 
periods.

Analysis Methodology 
For all study intersections, delay, level of service (LOS), and 95th percentile queue length analyses 
were performed in accordance with the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 6th Edition using 
Synchro 10 software. The traffic signal warrant evaluation process used for this study is based on 
the criteria presented in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) 2009 Edition, 
which is published by the Federal Highway Administration. 
 
2 Proposed Development 
 
The proposed development is located to the west of Ridgeview Rd and south of 191st St in Spring 
Hill, KS. The development is proposed to be a Spring Hill School District Middle School that would 
be located west of the existing Wolf Creek Elementary School. Access to the school would be 
provided via 193rd St, 192nd St, and a new dedicated school entrance off 191st St. The extension 
of 192nd St is proposed to include a roundabout east of Wolf Creek Elementary where a future 
north/south connection to 191st may be constructed as part of a separate project. In the near term, 
the roundabout may be used as additional queueing storage for morning school traffic entering 
Wolf Creek Elementary. The school will be approximately 105,000 square feet with 528 students 
and is expected to include a 400-meter track and athletic fields. A proposed site plan for the 
development is included in Appendix A. 
 
3 Existing Conditions 
 
3.1 Existing Street Network and Land Uses 
Ridgeview Road is adjacent to the proposed development to the east and is a 2-lane roadway 
with a posted speed limit of 45 mph. It is classified as a major collector in KDOT’s Functional 
Classification Map of Johnson County. 192nd and 193rd Streets currently act as access points for 
Wolf Creek Elementary School with the exiting traffic off those streets stop-controlled and 
Ridgeview Rd uncontrolled. In addition to the school traffic, 193rd also carries residential traffic 
that is south of the school.

191st Street is adjacent to the proposed development to the north and is a 2-lane roadway with a 
posted speed limit of 45 mph. The intersection of 191st St and Ridgeview Rd is two-way stop-
controlled with 191st St acting as the stop-controlled movement and Ridgeview Rd as the 
uncontrolled movement. 
 
The two roadways analyzed as part of this study are summarized in Table 1 and the existing 
conditions with signage is included in Figure 3.

3.2 Existing Traffic Volumes 
To assess the impacts of the proposed development, turning-movement counts were collected at 
the following intersections on February 6th, 2020: 
 
1. Ridgeview Rd & 191st St 
2. Ridgeview Rd & 192nd St 
3. Ridgeview Rd & 193rd St 
 
This data revealed that the weekday peak hours of the intersection were as follows: 
• 
AM Peak Hour: 
 
7:15AM – 8:15AM 
• 
PM Peak Hour: 
 
3:00PM – 4:00PM 
Within each of these peak hours, a peak hour factor (PHF) was calculated, which compares the 
traffic volume during the busiest 15-minutes of the peak hour with the total volume during the 
peak hour. It indicates how consistent traffic volume is during the peak hour. The existing peak 
hour traffic volumes are summarized in Appendix B.  
 
3.3 Intersection Capacity Analysis 
In order to analyze the traffic impacts, operating conditions were analyzed using SYNCHRO 10, 
a macroscopic analysis and optimization software. Synchro is based on study procedures outlined

Spring Hill Middle School 
Spring Hill, KS 
   
     Page 9   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Riverside, Missouri │ Kansas City, Missouri | Kansas City, Kansas │ Lenexa, Kansas 
in the Highway Capacity Manual, 6th edition. The analysis determines the “Level of Service” of the 
intersections and is based on factors such as the number and types of lanes, signal timing, traffic 
volumes, pedestrian activity, etc. This manual, which is used universally by traffic engineers to 
measure roadway capacity, establishes six levels of traffic service: Level A (“Free Flow”) to Level 
F (“Fully Saturated”).

Criteria 
Level of

B 
< 15 seconds 
C 
< 25 seconds 
D 
< 35 seconds 
E 
< 50 seconds 
F

Level of Service “D” is considered the minimum acceptable LOS in most areas. However, LOS E 
is sometimes accepted during peak periods. The above table shows the thresholds for Levels of 
Service A through F for unsignalized intersections.  
 
Intersection capacity analysis was performed for existing weekday AM peak hour and PM peak 
hour traffic conditions at the intersections listed in Table 3. Analysis was not performed at the 
intersection of 191st and School Entrance as it does not exist yet. Detailed capacity analysis can 
be found in Appendix C.

The intersection currently operates at LOS “A” during the AM and PM peak hours. The stop 
controlled eastbound approach operates as a LOS “B” in both AM and PM peaks and the stop 
controlled westbound approach operates as a LOS “C” in both AM and PM peaks.  
 
Ridgeview Rd & 192nd St 
 
The intersection operates at LOS “A” during the AM and PM peak hours. The stop controlled 
eastbound approach operates as a LOS “C” in the AM peak and LOS “B” in the PM peak. 
 
Ridgeview Rd & 193rd St 
 
The intersection operates at LOS “A” during the AM and PM peak hours. The stop controlled 
eastbound approach operates as a LOS “D” in the AM peak and LOS “B” in the PM peak. 
 
Overall, all three intersections operate adequately in the AM and PM peak hours. 
 
4 Full Build Conditions 
 
4.1 Trip Generation 
Trip generation estimates developed for this study are based on the 10th Edition of the Trip 
Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The Manual is 
the most widely used industry resource for this type of data. The trip generation data are organized 
by land use types, with more than 170 different categories of land uses. For each category, the 
manual provides a data set for use in estimating the number of vehicle and person trips generated 
by a site based on its characteristics such as physical size or intensity. Trips may be estimated 
by direction (entering or exiting the site) and for time periods typically pertaining to a full day 
(weekday or weekend), peak hours of the adjacent roadway, and peak hours of the particular land 
use. Used properly, the Trip Generation Manual provides an objective basis for estimating trips 
generated by a proposed development. 
 
The ITE categories listed in below were used to project traffic volumes for the proposed 
developments using the listed intensities. The AM trips were estimated based on data that was 
collected in the peak hour of the adjacent street traffic (7-9am) whereas the PM trips were 
estimated based on the peak hour of the generator (school) as the school PM peak does not 
correlate with the 4-6pm peak of adjacent traffic used for trip generation estimates.

4.2 Trip Distribution 
The traffic generated by the proposed development was assigned to the adjacent roadway system 
based on existing traffic patterns and engineering judgement. It is anticipated that traffic will be 
distributed amongst the three access points for the middle school. The trip distribution is expected 
to be similar to the existing elementary school boundaries with the majority of middle school traffic 
coming from the south and the east.

4.3 Signal Warrant Analysis 
Traffic signal warrants were evaluated for Existing and Full Build conditions at the intersection of 
Ridgeview Rd & 191st St. To warrant traffic signalization, an intersection must satisfy one or more 
of the nine warrants presented in the MUTCD. However, the satisfaction of a signal warrant shall 
not in itself require the installation of a traffic signal. For the purpose of this study process, the 
traffic signal warrant evaluation was limited to Signal Warrants 1-4 for the existing conditions and 
Warrant 3 for the Full Build scenario. A brief description of the warrant, based on traffic volumes, 
as presented in the MUTCD is provided as follows: 
 
Signal Warrant 1 - Eight-hour vehicular volume 
The Minimum Vehicular Volume, Condition A, is intended for situations where a large volume 
of intersecting traffic is the primary reason to consider installing a traffic signal. The 
Interruption of Continuous Traffic, Condition B, is intended for situations where the traffic 
volume on a major street is so heavy that traffic on a minor intersecting street suffers 
excessive delay or conflict in entering or crossing the major street. If neither Condition A nor 
B is met, Warrant 1 allows for re-evaluation of the warrant using a reduction of the traffic 
volumes, assuming an adequate trial of other alternatives that could cause less delay and 
inconvenience to traffic has failed to solve the traffic problems. To meet Warrant 1, either 
condition A or B must be met.  
 
Signal Warrant 2 - Four-hour vehicular volume  
The Four-Hour Vehicular Volume signal warrant conditions are intended to be applied where 
the volume of intersecting traffic is the principal reason to consider installing a traffic control 
signal.  
 
Signal Warrant 3 - Peak-hour volume  
The Peak Hour signal warrant is intended for use at a location where traffic conditions are 
such that for a minimum of one hour of an average day, the minor-street traffic suffers undue 
delay when entering or crossing the major street. This warrant is intended to apply for unusual 
cases where a facility generates or attracts an unusual amount of traffic over a short time. 
 
Signal Warrant 4 - Pedestrian volume 
The Pedestrian Volume signal warrant is intended for application where the traffic volume on 
a major street is so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delay in crossing the major 
street.

4.4 Intersection Capacity Analysis 
Intersection capacity analysis was performed for the AM and PM peak hours with traffic volumes 
anticipated from the new development. Assumed baseline intersection configurations for future 
intersections do not consider the addition of turn lanes on any approach. The proposed new 
school entrance off 191st St, Ridgeview & 192nd, and Ridgeview & 193rd used a peak hour factor 
of .75 for both peak periods to account for the short peaks expected for school traffic. For 
Ridgeview & 191st, a peak hour factor of .92 was used.  
 
Results from intersection capacity analyses under existing lane configurations and traffic control 
can be seen in Table 6. Results from analyses which consider potential intersection 
improvements can be seen in Table 7. Turn lane warrant analysis followed guidelines described 
in Kansas Department of Transportation’s Access Management Policy. 
 
Ridgeview Rd & 191st St 
 
The addition of site generated traffic is expected to result in an overall LOS “A”, with the eastbound 
approach a LOS “B” in the AM peak and LOS “B” in the PM peak. The westbound approach is 
expected to have a LOS “C” in the AM peak and LOS “B” in the PM peak.  
 
Potential Improvements: 
 
The northbound left-turn movement meets left-turn lane warrants. However, the turn-lane did 
not improve the overall intersection delay. 
 
Ridgeview Rd & 192nd St 
 
The addition of site generated traffic is expected to result in an overall LOS “A”, with the eastbound 
approach a LOS “C” in the AM peak and LOS “B” in the PM peak.

Potential Improvements: 
 
The northbound left-turn movement meets left-turn lane warrants. However, the turn-lane did 
not improve the overall intersection delay and improved the eastbound delay in the AM peak 
by less than 2%. 
 
Ridgeview Rd & 193rd St 
 
The addition of site generated traffic is expected to result in an overall LOS “A”, with the eastbound 
approach a LOS “C” in the AM peak and LOS “B” in the PM peak.  
 
Potential Improvements: 
 
The northbound left-turn movement meets left-turn lane warrants. However, the turn-lane did 
not improve the overall intersection delay and improved the eastbound delay in the AM peak 
by less than 2.5%. 
 
191st St & School Entrance 
 
The proposed intersection is expected to operate at LOS “A” with no approach deficiencies during 
either peak hour. 
 
Overall, all four study intersections operate adequately in the AM and PM peak hours without any 
auxiliary turn lanes.

5 Intersection Sight Distance 
 
Using AASHTO’s guidelines and a posted speed of 45 mph, the minimum recommended sight 
distance of 500 feet was used to determine if there were any intersection sight distance issues 
at the three study intersections. While there were no observed intersection sight distance 
issues, there is a tree on the west of Ridgeview Rd, south of 192nd St that will need it’s lower 
branches occasionally trimmed in order to keep adequate sight distance for traffic turning from 
192nd to northbound Ridgeview Rd.

6 Summary 
 
RIC completed the preceding study to analyze the traffic impacts associated with a proposed 
middle school development west of Ridgeview Rd and south of 191st St in Spring Hill, KS. Based 
on traffic analysis completed, the following summary is provided:  
 
• 
Access to the development is provided via three unsignalized access points, with two on 
Ridgeview Rd and one on 191st St. The intersection on 191st will be built as part of this 
development. 
• 
The proposed middle school was estimated to generate a total of 306 new trips in the 
AM peak hour and 174 new trips in the PM peak hour. 
• 
Existing intersection’s sight distances meet AASHTO requirements 
• 
The intersection of Ridgeview Rd & 191st St does not meet signal warrants. 
• 
It is expected that the three intersections analyzed as part of this study will operate 
acceptably without any additional lanes in the Full Build scenario.
