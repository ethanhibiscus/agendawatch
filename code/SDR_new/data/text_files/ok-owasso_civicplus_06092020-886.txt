SUBJECT: 
Annexation (OA 20-02) and Rezoning (OZ 20-02) – Northeast Corner of East 76th 
Street North and North 129th East Avenue 
DATE: 
June 5, 2020 
BACKGROUND: 
The Community Development Department received a request for annexation of property 
located at the intersection of East 76th Street North and North 129th East Avenue. The subject 
property is composed of approximately 4 acres of land and is currently zoned Residential Single 
Family Estate (RE) in Tulsa County. Upon annexation, the applicant is requesting the property be 
brought into Owasso City Limits as Commercial Shopping (CS) via an accompanying rezoning 
request (OZ 20-02).

ANALYSIS: 
The property is currently zoned RE in Tulsa County and is contiguous with city limits on the western 
boundary of the property. The applicant is requesting the property be assigned a corresponding 
zoning of CS upon annexation via a concurrent rezoning request (OZ 20-02). Typically, property is 
annexed either under Agriculture (AG) zoning or as the County’s corresponding zoning 
designation under the Owasso Zoning Code. However, an applicant may request an alternate 
zoning be applied if it corresponds to the Land Use Master Plan.  In this case, the GrOwasso 2030

Land Use Master Plan identifies the subject property for commercial land uses. Therefore, 
assigning a zoning of CS to the property upon annexation is appropriate. 
The subject property is currently used for residential purposes, as two homes presently occupy 
each of the two lots. The applicant intends to develop the property for commercial purposes. 
This proposed future use is consistent with the GrOwasso 2030 Land Use Master Plan, as said plan 
calls out the subject property for commercial uses. Further, the proposed commercial uses will 
complement the existing commercial uses to the south and west of the subject property. It 
should be noted that the applicant successfully obtained the necessary signatures to release the 
private covenant that restricted the subject lots to residential uses only.  State Statute requires 60% 
of the lot owners must approve the release of such restrictions.  The applicant was successful in this 
effort and filed the required paperwork with Tulsa County.    
The City of Owasso will provide water, sanitary sewer, Fire, Police, and EMS to the property upon 
annexation. Any future development that occurs on the subject property must adhere to all 
Owasso subdivision, zoning, and engineering requirements. 
PLANNING COMMISSION: 
The Planning Commission will consider this item at their regular meeting on June 8, 2020.

SUBJECT: 
OPUD 20-01- Owasso Assisted Living Center 
DATE:  
June 5, 2020 
BACKGROUND: 
The Community Development Department received a Planned Unit Development (PUD) 
application for the Owasso Assisted Living Center, a proposed assisted living development. The 
subject property is located north and west of the intersection of East 116th Street North and North 
126th East Avenue. The property is approximately 8.722 acres in total size but will be treated as 
two separate development areas. The southern area (Development Area A) will be 
approximately 2.978 acres in size, and the northern (Development Area B) will be approximately 
5.734 acres in size.  The property was recently annexed under Ordinance 1166, approved by the 
City Council on May 19, 2020, and was assigned a zoning of Agriculture (AG).  A separate 
rezoning request (OZ 20-01) was also concurrently filed with this PUD requesting that the southern 
2.978 acres of this property be given a zoning designation of Commercial Shopping (CS) and the 
northern section a Residential Multi-Family (RM) designation.

N/A 
CONCEPT OF A PUD: 
A planned unit development, also known as a PUD, is a development concept that allows for 
greater creativity and flexibility than typically allowed under traditional zoning and planning 
practices.  For example, PUDs often allow developers to place different zonings and land uses in 
close proximity to each other.  Developers may also have more flexibility in certain aspects of 
development, such as building setback requirements and building height limitations, which can 
be more restrictive in standard zoning districts.  However, a PUD should not be considered a tool 
to circumvent the City’s Zoning Code and Subdivision Regulations.  All aspects of the PUD 
application are subject to public comment as well as consideration and approval from the 
Community Development Department, the Owasso Technical Advisory Committee, the Owasso 
Planning Commission, and the Owasso City Council. 
ANALYSIS: 
Owasso Assisted Living Center is a proposed residential assisted living facility. The subject property is 
proposed to be broken into two different areas: a northern development area (Development Area 
B) and a southern area (Development Area A). Development Area A currently contains a single-
family dwelling unit, which will be used as office space and the Director’s residence until such time 
as the tract is sold and redeveloped for commercial uses. 
The residential care facility will be constructed within Development Area B and will house individuals 
who need assistance with daily activities, including individuals who need memory care services. The 
proposed development has the ability to bring new, high skilled jobs to the City, as nurses and other 
medical professionals will be needed to staff the assisted living center.  
An annexation request was approved last month by City Council for the subject property with a 
zoning of AG applied to the property (Ordinance 1166).  In order to accommodate the proposed 
uses, the zoning of AG needs to be changed. As such, a rezoning request was submitted 
concurrently with this PUD application. The applicant is seeking to apply CS zoning to Development 
Area A. The office space and accessory director’s residence proposed for Development Area A 
are allowed within the CS zoning category, under the proposed PUD 20-01. 
The applicant is also seeking to change the zoning designation in Development Area B to 
Residential Multi-Family (RM) in order to accommodate the assisted living facility. The RM zoning 
category allows for the highest possible density residential development, with >12 DU/Ac 
allowed; the proposed 16.542 DU/Ac meets the allowable density. Allowed uses in the RM district 
include apartments, duplexes, senior assisted living facilities, and townhomes. All development 
that proposes an RM zoning, except for single-family detached housing, are required to utilize the 
PUD process to gain approval. 
There will be three (3) points of access into the property; one from 116th Street North and two from 
North 126th East Avenue. Additionally, the PUD document states that in the event the property is 
split, there will be wording in the plat covenants that provide for mutual parking privileges between 
developed areas.  There is currently a City of Owasso street widening project for East 116th Street 
North, between Garnett Road and North 129th East Avenue that will affect the properties southern 
boundary. Internal access and final access locations will be finalized during the platting and site 
planning stages of development. 
Street yards with landscaping will be installed along the site’s frontage on East 116th Street North 
and North 126th East Avenue as required by code as well as a twenty (20) foot buffer yard, with a six 
(6) foot opaque fence, and landscaping along the north boundary of the property in order to 
protect the existing surrounding residential development. A single monument style ground sign for 
the Assisted Living Center (Development Area B) will be allowed on East 116th Street North, in 
Development Area A. The sign will be limited to six (6) feet in height and forty-two (42) square feet in 
surface area.  Additionally, the applicant has asked that Development Area A be allowed a sign 
for any future commercial development.  Staff is supportive of this request as two ground signs 
would be allowed anyway on Development Area A because it has frontage on two public streets. 
The proposed PUD meets the amenity requirements as required in the Owasso Zoning Code. 
Amenities to be provided include, but are not limited to, a courtyard and walking paths for passive 
and active recreation and are described in the Conceptual Site Plan. The project will be required 
to provide stormwater detention onsite, with the design and placement of such stormwater 
detention areas to be determined during the engineering and platting phase of development. 
Parking areas meet the requirements of the Owasso Zoning Code in that the project provides 1 
space per 3 beds, plus 1 space for each employee working during the largest shift.  
The City of Owasso will provide sanitary sewer, Fire, Police, and EMS services to the proposed 
development. Washington County Rural Water District #3 will provide water to the proposed 
development. If the PUD is approved, the applicant would provide final development plans for 
the area being developed for administrative review and approval by City Staff.  These plans 
shall include civil engineering drawings, landscape plans, drainage plans, and utility plans. 
 
Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, the applicant did not hold a neighborhood meeting but rather 
mailed the concept plan to the adjoining neighborhood.  The applicant received 3 comments 
regarding the proposal. 
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN CONSISTENCY: 
The GrOwasso 2030 Land Use Master Plan is a document that provides a moderately flexible tool for 
evaluating development proposals.  Currently, the Master Plan calls for commercial uses on the 
subject property.  Utilizing the property for a commercial use, like the applicant proposes for 
Development Area A, would be consistent with the vision laid out for this property within the Master 
Plan. Likewise, using the property for a residential use, like the applicant proposes for Development 
Area B, would be a reduction in the intensity of use allowed by the Master Plan.  A reduction in the 
intensity of a land use is allowed without an amendment to the Master Plan. 
The subject property is adjacent to areas called out for commercial land uses on its southern 
boundary, and on portions of its eastern and western boundaries. This means that the commercial 
development proposed in Development Area A, in the southern portion of the site, will be 
harmonious with the future surrounding land uses. Similarly, the subject property is adjacent to areas 
called out for residential land uses along its northern boundary, as well as on portions of its eastern 
and western boundaries. The proposed residential care facility, within Development Area B, will also 
serve a residential purpose; therefore, the land use proposed in the northern portion of the property 
is agreeable with furniture surrounding land uses.  
HARMONY WITH THE EXISTING AND EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT: 
The land use proposed in this PUD is both commercial and high density residential. The proposed 
commercial land use in Development Area A, in the southern portion of the site, lends itself well 
to blending into the commercial corridor along East 116th Street North envisioned in the Master 
Plan. The proposed assisted living facility in Development Area B, in the northern portion of the 
site, is well-suited to agree with the future residential district that the Master Plan envisions for the 
area north of the property. Further, the proposed PUD is located in an area that is slated to be 
the boundary between future commercial and residential land uses. Because of this, the fact 
that there are two different proposed land uses for the property is consistent with the vision the 
City has for this area. Staff has determined that the proposed development is in harmony with 
the surrounding existing and expected development. 
 
PLANNING ISSUES: 
Future planning issues must still be considered if the PUD amendment is approved.  If approved, 
the applicant will be required to adhere to all City of Owasso subdivision regulations and 
engineering requirements. 
According to the Owasso Zoning Code, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on 
any PUD application and determine the following: 
1. Whether the PUD is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
2. Whether the PUD is in harmony with the existing and expected development of 
surrounding areas. 
3. Whether the PUD is a unified treatment of the development possibilities of the project 
site. 
4. Whether the PUD is consistent with the stated purpose and standards of the PUD 
ordinance: 
a. To permit innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitation 
on the character and intensity of use assuring compatibility with adjoining and 
proximate properties; 
b. To permit flexibility within the development to best utilize the unique physical 
features of the particular site; 
c. To provide and preserve meaningful open space; and 
d. To achieve a continuity of function and design within the development. 
PLANNING COMMISSION: 
The Planning Commission will consider this item at their regular meeting on June 8, 2020.

II.  DESIGN AND INTENT STATEMENT 
 
 
Owasso Assisted Living Center is a Planned Unit Development (PUD) proposing an assisted living and 
commercial development of 8.722 acres (including ½ of adjacent street rights-of-way) located at the 
northwest corner of the intersection of 116th St. N. and 126th E. Ave., in unincorporated Tulsa County (City 
of Owasso annexation application pending at time of this writing), Oklahoma.   
 
To meet the growing need in Owasso, the “Owasso Assisted Living Center” proposes an approximately 83-
room residential care facility, of which some units are intended for memory care.  The frontage along 116th 
St. N. is planned for future commercial development, but the existing dwelling will be used as the facility 
director’s residence and/or office until market conditions permit commercial development.   
 
At the time this PUD is written, the site is presently in the process of being annexed by request of the 
present owner (OA 20-01). 
 
As planned, the assisted living facility development will feature fully a sprinkled building for fire protection 
and solar power for supplemental electricity, to include solar-powered outdoor lighting standards. 
 
By its design, as outlined in the Owasso Zoning Code, this PUD is intended to: provide a unified treatment 
of the development possibilities of the project site; encourage creative development of land; promote project 
design that is often unseen in conventional development; serve as a tool for intelligent, well-planned, and 
quality developments that fit within Owasso’s existing neighborhoods and context of the surrounding area; 
provide flexibility to allow for the development of properties with unique physical characteristics by 
promoting innovative design and providing guidelines which ensure that development is beneficial to the 
City of Owasso’s future growth (Section 9.1.1).  Further, this PUD has been prepared to achieve the 10 
specific goals listed in the Owasso Zoning Code: 1. Maintain and Enhance the Quality of Life in Owasso, 
2. Provide Opportunities for Urban Infill, 3. Maintain and Promote a Sense of Community, 4. Encourage 
Development That Otherwise Could Not Occur on the Site, 5. Preserve and Provide Meaningful Open 
Space, 6. Promote Connectivity and Compatibility with Surrounding Development, 7. Inspire Unique and 
Thoughtful Development, 8. Support the Development of Strong Neighborhoods, 9. Provide Amenities 
Beyond Conventional Development, and 10. Preserve the Physical Characteristics of the Land (Section 
9.1.2). 
 
The subject property is presently zoned AG-R in unincorporated Tulsa County, and has been requested to 
be assigned a consistent AG Agriculture District upon annexation.  In order to permit the land uses and 
intensities proposed by this PUD, the Owasso Zoning Code will require the inclusion of certain zoning 
districts and certain proportions of underlying zoning districts within the PUD.  An accompanying application 
is being filed to rezone the commercial frontage to CS Commercial Shopping District and the assisted living 
facility acreage to RM Residential Multi-Family District (OZ 20-01). 
 
Development Areas are depicted on Exhibit B “PUD Conceptual Site Plan.”  Commercial Development Area 
A is planned for retail-oriented businesses and Development Area B is planned for the assisted living facility.  
Although final Development Area boundaries shall be determined by the future subdivision plat(s), 
Development Area A corresponds with the underlying CS zoning requested and Development Area B with 
the underlying RM zoning requested.

The “Owasso Assisted Living Center” proposes amenities for residents as appropriate for a residential care 
facility, including a courtyard and walking paths for passive and active recreation.  Zoning Code Section 
9.2.12 applies to single-family and multi-family residential developments, as distinguished from residential 
care (“assisted living”) facilities.  Additional site amenities for residents and their guests may be added as 
needed by the facility owners.  The Exhibit B “PUD Conceptual Site Plan” represents initial concepts for 
amenities. 
 
The Table V-1, Land Use Evaluation Matrix and page V-7 of the of the GrOwasso 2030 Land Use Master 
Plan provide that the requested CS zoning is Allowed within the Commercial designation.  The requested 
RM Residential Multi-Family zoning is understood to be consistent with the Master Plan as it will be 
recognized as less intensive than the specific zoning districts Allowed.  Existing and proposed zoning are 
reflected on Exhibits E and F, respectively. 
 
The PUD will allow the most efficient use of the land which is harmonious with the surrounding land uses, 
as represented on Exhibit A, “Aerial Photography & Boundary Depiction.”  A conceptual development plan 
depicting the Development Areas and design features is provided on Exhibit B “PUD Conceptual Site Plan”. 
The PUD shall be developed in accordance with the use and development regulations of the City of Owasso 
Zoning Code, except as otherwise specified herein. Bulk and area standards within the proposed 
Development Standards generally follow those of the proposed underlying CS district for Development Area 
A and those of the proposed underlying RM district for Development Area B; where exceptions are 
proposed for design flexibility, the concerned bulk and area standard is designated with a “†” symbol in the 
tables that follow in Section III of this PUD. 
 
Although Zoning Code Section 9.2.1 would permit at least 143 dwelling units in the proposed underlying 
RM zoning district, this PUD will restrict the assisted living facility to 95 total rooms / dwelling units.  In 
addition to lowering the density otherwise permitted, this PUD will impose higher development standards 
than if developed with straight residential zoning.   
 
Allocated commercial or residential density may be transferred to another lot or lots by written instrument 
executed by the owner of the lot from which the floor area or residential density is to be allocated and 
approved by the Owasso Director of Community Development, provided (1) that the reallocation shall not 
exceed 15% of the initial allocation to the lot to which the transfer of floor area or residential density is to 
be made unless approved for a PUD Minor Amendment, and (2) the overall densities and intensities, in 
terms of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area, shall not exceed those of the initial PUD as approved. 
 
This PUD proposes to establish a conceptual development plan with designation of development areas, 
allocation of uses and intensity of uses and development standards and conditions, to be followed by more 
specific subdivision plat(s) and commercial detailed site plans for each development.

IV.  GENERAL PROVISIONS AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
 
 
 
IV.A.  ACCESS AND CIRCULATION:   
 
The site has access via 116th St. N. and N. 126th E. Ave., both presently County roads.  A City of Owasso 
street widening plan is in design for 116th St. N. between Garnett Rd. and 129th E. Ave., including the site’s 
frontage.  While drive connection locations and internal access will align with the widening plans and will 
be designed during the platting and site planning stages, the conceptual plans for the assisted living facility 
are indicated on the Exhibit B “PUD Conceptual Site Plan.”  Only one (1) point of access will be permitted 
to 116th St. N.  On 126th E. Ave., a mutual access drive will be constructed on the common line between 
the future commercial and assisted living facility lots, and will be secured by mutual access or similar 
easement.  Subject to land use compatibility, a mutual access or similar easement shall be provided 
between Development Area “A” and the lot to the west and at the time of final platting, facilitating east-west 
access parallel to 116th St. N.  
 
Where not in existence, sidewalks along exterior street frontages shall be constructed by the individual lot 
developer in accordance with the Owasso Subdivision Regulations.  Widening plans presently show a 5’-
wide sidewalk along the site’s 116th St. N. frontage, to be constructed by the City of Owasso.  Sidewalks 
which are proposed outside of public or private street rights-of-way shall be placed in a sidewalk easement.   
 
Limits of No Access (LNA) will be imposed by the future plat(s) along street frontages, except at approved 
street intersections. 
 
IV.B.  SIGNS:  To identify the assisted living facility, a monument style ground sign may be permitted along 
116th St. N. and located within Development Area A, limited to six (6) feet in height and 42 square feet in 
display surface area.  The ground sign shall be allowed in addition to the one (1) ground sign serving the 
host lot as otherwise permitted, provided minimum sign separations are maintained.  
 
Except as otherwise outlined herein and except or as may be approved as a part of any future Unified Sign 
Plan (USP), all signage shall comply with the Owasso Zoning Code, and any changes to signage 
requirements must be approved by the Community Development Department. 
 
IV.C.  UTILITIES AND DRAINAGE:  The site within the Washington County Rural Water District # 3 (RWD) 
water service area.  There is an existing 12” waterline along 116th St. N. and an existing 4” waterline along 
the east side of 126th E. Ave.  It is anticipated that the assisted living facility development area will be served 
by customary extensions of the existing RWD waterline(s) in the area.  Per the City of Owasso atlas data, 
there is an existing eight (8) inch sanitary sewerline along the north side of 116th St. N. a few hundred feet 
east of the southeast corner of the subject property.  This area system drains to the Morrow Lift Station.  
Sanitary sewer service plans are in design, but the site will be served. Fire hydrant locations shall be 
coordinated with and approved by the Owasso Fire Marshal during platting and commercial site plan stages. 
  
The site contains a small hilltop in a slight ridgeline, is moderately sloped, and drains to the east, north, and 
west toward tributaries of Blackjack Creek.  An internal stormwater collection and detention system will be 
designed and constructed to drain the site to stormwater detention facility(ies), to be sited and designed 
during the platting stage.  Existing water and sanitary sewer utilities are shown on Exhibit C “Existing 
Utilities” of this PUD.  This information is per City of Owasso and RWD atlas data and does not reflect the

most recent changes, such as those existing and proposed line extensions relating to the widening of 116th 
St. N. 
 
IV.D.  ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND TOPOGRAPHY:  The site contains a small hilltop in a slight 
ridgeline, is moderately sloped, and drains to the east, north, and west toward tributaries of Blackjack Creek.   
 
There are no FEMA-designated Special Flood Hazard Areas within or adjacent to the subject property. 
 
The Soil Survey of Tulsa County, Oklahoma was used to help identify soils types and possible constraints 
to development.  The site primarily contains Coweta-Bates complex (3 to 5% slopes), with a small strip 
along the east side containing Dennis-Pharoah Complex (1 to 3% slopes). 
 
Development constraints associated with these soil types will be addressed in the engineering design phase 
of the project.  Prior to construction, a geotechnical report will be performed to recommend paving sections 
and subgrade design.  Soil types and associated slopes and topography are shown on Exhibit D of this 
PUD. 
 
IV.E.  EXISTING ZONING AND LAND USE:  The site is a rural residential tract with a single-family dwelling 
and is otherwise generally vacant / agricultural.  The site is presently zoned AG-R in unincorporated Tulsa 
county and has been requested be assigned a consistent AG Agriculture District upon annexation.  An 
accompanying application is being filed to rezone the commercial frontage to CS commercial and the 
assisted living facility acreage to RM Residential Multi-Family (OZ 20-01). 
 
IV.F.  PLATTING AND SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS:  No building permit shall be issued until a 
subdivision plat has been submitted to and approved by the Owasso Planning Commission and the Owasso 
City Council and duly filed of record.  The required subdivision plat shall include covenants of record 
implementing the development standards of the approved PUD and the City of Owasso shall be a 
beneficiary thereof.  Per Zoning Code Section 11.3, nonresidential buildings within Development Area A 
and the assisted living facility in Development Area B shall submit and receive Owasso Community 
Development staff approval of a site plan application.  The City of Owasso may refer the site plans to the 
Owasso Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for review and recommendations.

IV.G.  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS:  Landscaping and screening shall meet or 
exceed the requirements of the Owasso Zoning Code at the time of site plan approval and this PUD.  
Development Area B will meet the 20% open space, common areas, or amenities requirement as described 
in Owasso Zoning Code Section 9.2.2.  A screening fence not less than six (6) feet in height and a 
landscaped area of not less than 10 feet in width shall be maintained along the boundaries of commercial 
areas adjoining residential development or a residential zoning district, provided however, if an adjoining 
residential district is undeveloped or used for nonresidential purposes, required screening may be deferred 
until residential development occurs.  A buffer yard not less than 20’ in width and a screening fence not 
less than six (6) feet in height shall be installed and maintained along the north PUD boundary adjoining 
the rural residential tract.  Within the buffer yard along the north line, vegetation shall include, at a minimum, 
one (1) tree for each 30 feet, at least 50% of which shall be evergreen.  The agricultural tract to the west is 
designated Commercial on the GrOwasso 2030 Land Use Master Plan, except for a small part along the 
north end of the west line.  Since ultimate use and intensities cannot be known at this time, the buffer 
requirement along the west PUD boundary shall be suspended unless a lower intensity use is in existence 
to the west at the time of site development or redevelopment, which requirement shall meet the Zoning 
Code standards then in effect.  The assisted living facility in Development Area B shall meet or exceed the 
10’ street yard requirement along 126th E. Ave. (Section 19.3.2.a). 
 
All trees shall be planted at least five (5) feet away from all underground utilities. No alteration to approved 
landscape plans shall be permitted without approval from the Community Development Department. 
Following the completion of the planting of all landscape material, the property owner shall be responsible 
for long-term health, care, and maintenance of all plant material on site. Dead and diseased plant material 
shall be replaced as per the approved landscape plan. 
 
IV.H.  ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:  Within commercial Development Area A, the 
subdivision plat(s) shall contain restrictive covenants: (1) lot maintenance covenants requiring such lots to 
be maintained clear of trash and debris, (2) requiring full screening for outdoor heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning (HVAC) equipment;  If there are multiple lots, and in the event of future lot-splits, covenants 
shall also include (3) providing for mutual parking privileges, so that all lots may allow their excess parking 
spaces to be used by patrons of adjacent lots, and (4) easements allowing cross access between lots.  
Within commercial Development Area A, no metal exterior surfaces shall be allowed for commercial exterior 
building façades facing streets or lot boundaries.  Outdoor lighting standards shall be limited to 24 feet in 
overall height and shall otherwise meet the minimum requirements for lighting outlined in the Owasso 
Zoning Code at the time of site plan approval, including shielding and footcandle restrictions at property 
boundaries. 
 
IV.I.  SCHEDULE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Development of the project is expected to commence immediately 
upon City of Owasso approval of construction plans and issuance of Building Permit(s).  The assisted living 
facility in Development Area B is anticipated to be constructed first, within approximately 12 months.

SUBJECT: 
 
Closure of a twenty (20) foot wide Waterline Easement – Rejoice Christian   
 
 
 
Campus 
 
DATE: 
 
June 5, 2020 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
The City of Owasso received a request from Rejoice Christian School for the closing of a waterline 
easement as described on plat 6622, Rejoice Christian Campus.  The easement is more particularly 
described as: 
 
A total of 7,320 square feet of the 20’ waterline easement on Lot 1, Block 1, of Rejoice 
Christian Campus.  The property location is the 13407 E 106th St No, Owasso, Oklahoma. 
 
The subject easement is located on the Rejoice Christian School Campus underneath the proposed 
new sports fieldhouse.  The waterline within the easement will be relocated to another easement on 
the property that will be recorded by separate instrument.  The water provider in this location is 
Washington County Rural #3.  Because the plat was approved by the City Council with all the 
original easements, any closure requests that affect the approved plat regardless of the utility 
provider still requires City Council action.  The applicant has determined this easement will interfere 
with the construction of the new fieldhouse.  
 
All required notices were sent to all franchise holders and utility companies. The City of Owasso 
Public Works Department was contacted regarding the closing of the easement, and had no 
comment since the City does not serve water in this area.  No other utilities appear to be affected 
by the closing of this easement.   
 
Should the City Council approve to close these easements, the applicant will need to take them to 
District Court and file for vacation of the easement, to completely remove it from the books. 
 
TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE: 
 
The Technical Advisory Committee reviewed the request at their May 20, meeting.  No comments or 
concerns regarding negative impacts to utilities were expressed at the meeting.  
  
FUTURE ACTION: 
 
Staff intends to bring forth an ordinance requesting the closure of the easement.
