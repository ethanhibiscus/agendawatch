City Commission 
FROM:  
David Dillner, City Manager 
SUBJ: 
Consideration of the Independent Audit of the Financial Statements for Year-Ending December 31, 2019, 
prepared by Berberich Trahan & Co., P.A. 
DATE:  
June 8, 2020 
 
Background: 
In 2015, the City selected Berberich Trahan & Co., P.A. to conduct an independent audit of the City’s year-ending 
financial statements each year through 2019. Karen Linn of Berberich Trahan & Co. P.A., will be presenting the 
independent audit of the City’s financial statements via ZOOM.  
 
Attachments: 
The financial statements were not finished in time to be included with the agenda packet, although they will be made 
available to the City Commission and the general public on Friday. The City Manager’s annual letter has been included 
with this memorandum.  
 
Policy Issue: 
Per Resolution No. 2849, the City is required to contract for an annual independent audit of the City’s financial 
statements. The report provided by the independent auditor meets this requirement. 
 
Fiscal Impact: 
The independent audit of the year-ending 2019 financial statements cost the City $62,500. This amount is distributed 
between various funds of the City to reduce the amount any one funds pays for the annual audit and is included in the 
annual budget. 
 
Trade-offs: 
An independent audit provides the City Commission and the community with either a qualified or unqualified opinion that 
the City’s financial statements were prepared consistent with the standards applicable to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) as promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The audit shall be 
conducted in accordance with the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and applicable provisions of the Kansas Municipal Audit and 
Accounting Guide. While an independent audit cannot ensure that all financial standards are met, it does provide a certain 
level of confidence that the financial statements fairly represent the City’s financial condition and that internal controls are 
in place to discourage fraud.

Honorable City Commission and Citizens of El Dorado: 
 
Understanding a municipal government’s financial statements first requires an explanation as to 
how local governments actual plan and manage their finances. Cities (and counties) annually 
approve the operating budget with various fund budgets that define the parameters for each 
respective fund. In many cases (although not all), funds align with departments of the municipal 
organization. For example, the Water Fund provides the budgetary conditions and management 
tools for the Water Department. 
 
The General Fund is perhaps the most deviant of this guideline because it encapsulates the 
budgets for several “general governmental” departments such as Police, Fire, Parks, and an 
assortment of other departments and governmental functions paid from general government 
receipts. The departments contained in the General Fund share revenue from property taxes, sales 
taxes (the portion set aside for property tax relief by local ordinance), franchise fees, court fees, 
building permits, and a host of other revenue sources.  
 
Enterprise funds align with those departments who are intended to operate more like a business 
enterprise than a government entity. Enterprise funds generate revenue from user fees and charges 
specific to the utility and not from general government taxes and fees. In other words, the Water, 
Sewer, Refuse, and Compressed Natural Gas Funds all operate without receiving tax support. 
Customers are billed for the amount of service provided or consumed during a billing period.  
 
A few other funds operate in a hybrid configuration whereby the fund receives taxes or 
assessments, but not necessarily property taxes or sales taxes. The Tourism Fund, for example, 
operates with the majority of its revenue coming from hotel guest taxes. The Airport Fund 
receives a mill levy to help fund its operations, and it generates revenue from fuel sales and 
hangar rentals.  
 
The fund system ensures that dollars required to be spent on certain expenses are segregated from 
other revenues to avoid mixing that would most assuredly occur. I will be the first to admit that 
the system municipalities use to account for finances is cumbersome and confusing, especially to 
taxpayers who may be interested in knowing how the City spends tax dollars. Much of the 
breadth of the City’s financial statements are required by law or other accounting principle so that 
every municipality’s financial statements generally contain the same information. It’s a world 
dictated by accountants and not conducive to helping taxpayers who foot the bill understand 
municipal finance. 
 
The financial statements contained with this letter will provide you the financial information you 
need to better understand the City’s financial condition. When I write this letter each year, I try to 
think of what I would want to know if the roles were reversed and I were an interested citizen 
wanting to know how my local government spent my tax dollars. I hope the information provided 
will enlighten you with an understanding of how your tax dollars were used in the provision of 
public services. 
 
 
The City’s financial condition continues to strengthen in some cases and seems to move against a 
floating current in other cases. The City has been able to add to fund balances in many funds due 
to increasing revenues and prudently managing expenses. The simple rule is to just spending less 
than revenues for the year, and is age-old strategy carried out by the most successful businesses, 
households, and governments. It is the City’s aim every year. 
 
Spending more than revenues creates potential problems, especially when the City runs into a 
situation requiring an infusion of cash such as a natural disaster or economic downturn. Each 
fund’s balance provides insurance against these unforeseen situations that will arise from time to 
time, and that we must be prepared to endure or we may potentially face significant service 
reductions.  
 
The last several years I have written at length in this letter about structural deficits that can creep 
up on any government if they do not plan to hold the line on expenditures and then follow 
through on that plan. A budget is only as good as the paper it is printed on. Local government 
officials (including the city manager) must work diligently throughout the year to keep expenses 
as low as possible and within the adopted budget.  
 
Failure to do so means that the local government will spend down its fund balance. Spending 
down one’s savings account at home means that a household will not have as many funds 
available to weather a proverbial storm such as a job loss, significant home repair, or emergency 
medical procedure. In the same way, local governments must have sufficient fund balances to 
weather storms that arise.  
 
The chart below shows the adopted budget for 2019 as well as the actual revenues and 
expenditures for select funds. This simplified version of the City’s financial statements will 
provide you with some clues as to where the City may need to carefully monitor expenses so as to 
avoid spending down fund balance.

When I first informed the City Commission of the need to address several structural deficits 
within the City’s collection of funds, I shared that solutions would be forthcoming and that the 
ultimate resolution of the situation would take several years. I can report that the City is getting 
closer to addressing the structural issues first outlined. To be sure, the journey to financial health 
is never truly complete and will require the utmost attention and discipline to ensure that the City 
remains resilient well into the future. 
 
 
 
I wish to share one more chart to provide readers with an overview of the fund balances in each 
of the aforementioned funds. This will give you a sense as to the level of “insurance” the City has 
available to meet unexpected situations.

As you can see, all funds increased their fund balance at year-end and all funds exceed their 
respective minimum fund balance, as established by local policy. The City will continue to 
thoughtfully manage its budget in a way that hopefully gives taxpayers confidence that services 
will be provided no matter what happens. 
 
***** 
 
MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Lake Debt Pre-Payment. It is not very often that a community can pay back $8.6 million in 
advance of it being due for payment. After saving cash over the years, the City Commission 
elected to pre-pay the debt remaining on activated storage space in the lake at a “savings” of 
about $4.8 million in interest. The City of El Dorado now owns 49% of the water available in El 
Dorado Lake for the general water supply needs of the community and surrounding region. 
 
Record Sales Tax Collections. Last year, the City of El Dorado received a record $2.649 million 
from its one-cent (1.0%) sales tax on retail sales. The record did not last for long as the City 
brought in $2.678 million in sales tax receipts, equal to a 1.0% increase from the prior year’s 
record. The City breached the $2.6 million mark only twice in its history prior to 2019. It seems 
we can add another record to the proverbial trophy case as El Dorado claims its third year above 
the coveted $2.6 million threshold.  
 
For those keeping score, the City breached the $2.6 million level in 2015, 2018, and now 2019. 
This new record will hopefully become more of a new altitude mark instead of a ceiling. This will 
only be the case if El Dorado residents continue to shop local and if visitors find that the items 
needed in El Dorado stores while visiting. In all likelihood though, the increased receipts arise 
from another HollyFrontier turn-around. The next opportunity for a new record may be several 
years away. 
 
Rising Assessed Valuations. Assessed valuations in the City continue to increase primarily 
because of private investment and private property transactions. In 2019, the assessed valuation 
of El Dorado increased $0.98 million, or nearly 1.1%, bringing the total assessed valuation for the 
community to $92.9 million. For reference, last year’s valuation came in at about $91.98 million. 
The City’s mill levy, which remained steady at 53.000 mills, annually generates about $4.9 
million in ad valorem property taxes to finance essential public services. Of this amount, the City 
received about $4.4 million, meaning about 9% of taxes assessed to property owners was 
 
 
delinquent. The estimated actual value of real and personal property in El Dorado is $605.5 
million compared to $597.6 million a year ago. 
 
The future bodes well for local valuations due to the occurrence of private development as well as 
the near-term expiration of several tax abatements. I mentioned in last year’s letter that LakePoint 
El Dorado, LLC, a retirement community, will add about $2.8 million to the assessed valuation in 
2021, and BG Products, Inc. will add another $24.7 million beginning in 2022. The City 
continues to anticipate the benefits that will come from the soon-to-be-new tax revenues paid on 
the valuations of these prior projects. In total, these two projects will collectively contribute 
nearly $0.4 million in property taxes per year to the City of El Dorado once tax abatements 
sunset. This much needed revenue will go straight to public services to address the structural 
deficit habit the City cannot seem to quit. 
 
Wind Turbine Lawsuit.  Historically, 2019 will be known as the year the City paid off a 
significant portion of outstanding lake debt and took ownership of 49% of the storage capacity of 
El Dorado Lake. It hopefully will not be remembered as the year the wind turbine at the Water 
Reclamation Facility came down. The City settled its lawsuit concerning the viability of the 
turbine in 2019.  
 
In total, the City spent $480,452 in legal expenses throughout the lawsuit. It seemed that the 
attorneys’ clock would not stop during the litigation. Even so, the City’s legal counsel represented 
the City’s interests well and got the best out of the settlement that could have been expected given 
the circumstances. The City may have settled the suit, but will continue to make an annual debt 
service payment of $80,157 from the Sewer Fund until 2033.  
 
Perhaps a silver lining is that the wind turbine was razed and removed from El Dorado’s skyline, 
giving hope that this project will soon be lost to time. Demolition of the wind turbine actually 
generated revenue. The City paid $24,711 to demolish and remove the turbine, although it 
received $47,200 from the sale of surplus materials from the wind turbine. Therefore, the project 
netted the City $22,489, which reimbursed the Sewer Fund for a trifling amount of the total 
project expenses paid from the fund. Even more to the point, the net gain from razing the 
structure might be considered quite the deal given that it cost $134,669 to construct the wind 
turbine in the first place.    
 
It goes without saying that the project had a considerable impact on the City’s Sewer Fund, 
causing the fund’s cash reserve to be significantly depleted. The fund has since made a recovery 
and is now collecting more revenue than it is paying out. It’s good to have the project and all its 
troubles behind us. 
 
Transient Guest Tax Receipts. The City collected $176,466 in transient guest taxes for 
overnight stays in 2019. Transient guest tax receipts were down 8.3% compared to the prior year. 
HollyFrontier’s turn-around, which is an extensive capital investment program that requires 
several weeks and well over 1,000 contractors, helped bring in the hotel taxes as non-refinery 
visits were down. The City often sees a bump in transient guest taxes and sales taxes during turn-
around as contractors stay in hotels, shop at the grocery stores, and eat out in restaurants during 
their brief time in El Dorado. As mentioned in last year’s report, the City plans to use the surplus 
from last year’s bumper year to develop a community branding and marketing program. At the 
time of this writing, the City contracted with the Bajillion Agency to develop this program. 
 
 
 
 
Sale of Prairie Trails Golf Course. Last year, the City began a process to sell Prairie Trails Golf 
Course to GreatLife Golf and Fitness, LLC at an agreed upon price of $550,000, following receipt 
of a proposal from the company to acquire the City’s golf assets. Unfortunately, the transaction 
will not be completed as GreatLife was unable to secure financing amid the COVID-19 
pandemic. The City, however, was able to off-load the expense of operating Prairie Trails to 
GreatLife for most of the year. By leasing the golf course to GreatLife, the City was able to 
“save” the General Fund approximately $250,000 that have otherwise been transferred had Prairie 
Trails remained under municipal operation.  
 
Tennis Court Complex Project. The City and Unified School District 490 partnered together to 
construct the Sam Binter Tennis Court Complex in North Main Park. The nearly $1.6 million 
project is a great addition to the community, and provides sufficient courts for tennis and pickle 
ball play. The complex was designed with the goal of hosting a regional high school tennis 
tournament in the future. 
 
Plans sometimes go according to plan and sometimes they go somewhere else. The tennis court 
project is an example of a plan taking a slight turn. We arrived at our final destination, although 
we had to get there by a different route. The original plan was to use the proceeds from the sale of 
Prairie Trails Golf Course to pay for the majority of the City’s share of the project. This was not 
to be the case as discussed in the prior item. As such, the City will likely have to include its share 
of the project in an upcoming bond issuance to avoid a significant spend down of fund balance.  
 
I encourage you to stop by and check out the tennis court complex if you have not already done 
so. I hear they are pretty forgiving for our community’s tennis and pickle ball hobbyists and the 
pros think they are great too! 
 
Recruitment Challenges. As I mentioned last year, recruitment is one of the most critical 
challenges to the City’s current level of service. The Police Department has been especially 
impacted by recruitment challenges with five open positions for the last several years. Other 
departments have experienced modest challenges in filling vacant positions. People are the City’s 
most important asset because in a service-oriented government, people provide services directly 
to citizens. There are few other options, at present, to provide these critical services. 
 
To address these challenges, the City has taken a more proactive approach and has tried many 
different and innovative ways of reaching out to prospective employees. Job fairs, Facebook 
advertisements, and face-to-face recruiting are just some of the ways departments are working to 
recruit the next generation of employees. The City also annually reviews its pay plan to determine 
if adjustments are necessary to compete with public and private sector comparables.  
 
Needless to say, it will become more difficult to fill positions as the workforce begins to retire 
and fewer warm bodies are available to work. This will be a challenge for both the public and 
private sector over the next few decades. 
 
G.O. Bond, Series 2019A.The City issued $2.825 million of its general obligation (G.O.) bonds 
to finance several public projects. The bond financed the following projects over twenty years at 
an astonishingly low interest rate of 2.6%: 
 
 
Belmont Heights 3rd Addition, Phase I Improvements (Street and Sanitary Sewer) 
 
Criss 9th Addition Improvements (Street and Sanitary Sewer) 
 
Belmont Heights 3rd Addition, Phase II Improvements (Street and Sanitary Sewer) 
 
 
 
Gueda Street Improvements (Street) 
 
Locust Avenue Improvements (Street) 
 
Griffith Street Improvements (Street) 
 
N. Haverhill Improvements (Street) 
 
Main Trafficway Improvements (Street) 
 
Country Club Road Improvements (Street) 
The bond will be paid from special assessments on benefiting property owners as well as a mill 
levy to pay the City at-large portion of projects.  
 
Underfunded Public Pensions. Every year in this letter, I report on the status of the City’s 
public pension liability. The City of El Dorado participates in Kansas Public Employees 
Retirement System (KPERS) and the Kansas Police and Fire (KP&F) program for its post-
employment retirement benefits. Employees of the City are required to participate in KPERS or 
KP&F, and the City is required to contribute to these programs on each respective employee’s 
behalf. State law requires the City to publish in its financial statements the current and future 
liability associated with the unfunded portion of KPERS and KP&F directly attributed to the City.  
 
As of December 31, 2019, the City’s unfunded pension liability totaled $7.40 million compared 
to $7.36 million a year ago. The pension liability may be subdivided as follows:  KPERS at $3.17 
million, Kansas Police & Fire (KP&F) at $4.04 million, and the Library’s participation in KPERS 
at $199,391. 
***** 
 
The City is required to provide certain language in its transmittal letter, included with its 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (“CAFR”) that explains the policies and controls 
designed to ensure the City’s stewardship of public assets. I will briefly discuss these items in this 
next section of the letter. 
 
The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the City of El Dorado, Kansas, for the year ended 
December 31, 2019, has been prepared for the review of the governing body, citizens, and other 
interested in the financial condition of the City. Responsibility for both the accuracy of the 
presented data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests 
with the City. Staff believes the data as presented is accurate in all material respects and that it is 
presented in a manner designed to fairly represent the financial position and results of operations 
of the City measured by the financial activity of its various funds. Disclosures necessary to enable 
the reader to gain the maximum understanding of the City's financial activity have been included. 
 
The management of the City is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control 
structure designed to ensure that the assets of the City are protected from loss, theft or misuse, and 
to warrant that adequate accounting data is compiled to allow for the preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal control 
structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these objectives are 
met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that:  1) the cost of a control should not exceed 
the benefits likely to be derived; and 2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and 
judgments by management. 
 
All internal control evaluations occur within the above framework. Management believes that the 
City's internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance 
of proper recording of financial transactions. 
 
 
Generally accepted accounting principles, also known by the abbreviation GAAP, require that 
management provide a narrative introduction, overview and analysis to accompany the basic 
financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (also referred to as 
MD&A). This Letter of Transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A section, and should be 
read in conjunction with it. The MD&A section of the report may be found immediately 
following the report of the independent auditors. 
 
Independent Audit 
State statutes require an annual audit of the books of accounts, financial records and transactions 
of all departments of the City be performed by independent certified public accountants. Berberich 
Trahan & Co., P.A., conducted an independent audit of the City’s financial statements, and their 
opinion has been included with the financial statements. Interested persons are encouraged to refer 
to their opinion in reviewing the City’s financial statements. 
 
Relevant Financial Policies 
The City of El Dorado’s “General Financial and Budgetary Policies,” adopted by Resolution No. 
2849, have been included with the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for your information. 
I recommend interested readers review these policies by referring to the table of contents to 
determine where the policies are located in this document. These financial policies provide the 
framework with which the City manages its finances to ensure adequate internal control for the 
integrity of these financial statements. There were no changes to these policies during the year. 
 
ECONOMIC CONDITION AND OUTLOOK 
Private Sector Investment: 
The local economy continues to demonstrate a positive investment environment as projects 
totaling nearly $25.4 million were added to the community’s inventory. Several of these projects 
started last year, and are mentioned in this letter because the construction continued into 2019.  
 
The largest projects for the year included a $7 million capital investment by Union Tank Car in 
the expansion of its tank car refurbishing facility. The project created well over 100 new jobs and 
is a great business that fits into El Dorado’s industrial base. BG Products, Inc. completed its $32 
million expansion of its warehouse and distribution facility. The taxable valuation of this project 
is $19.8 million, which has been granted a ten-year tax abatement until 2029. Mears Fertilizer 
committed to a $16 million expansion.  
 
Orscheln Farm and Home Supply, LLC committed to the construction of a $5 million project. 
The project will construct a larger store to replace an existing site in El Dorado. Orscheln’s has 
requested use of the City’s tax increment financing (TIF) authority to assist with the cost of 
public infrastructure needed to make their new site viable. The City gets a win-win from the 
project as a new storefront is built and the former Fenton Ford site is razed, improving one of the 
most travelled corridors into El Dorado. The project is under construction as I write this letter, 
and is a welcome investment by Orscheln’s. 
 
The City approved the Flint Creek Estates development that will commence construction in 2020. 
The $5.3 million residential development will construct thirty-two single-family residential units 
for moderate income families. The City incentivized the project with tax credits from the Kansas 
Housing Resources Corporation as a way to bring affordable housing to the community. The 
developer has similar experience in communities near El Dorado, and so the project looks to be 
very promising. 
 
 
 
The City partnered with another property owner in downtown El Dorado to facilitate the 
redevelopment of an anchor building with an estimated $500,000 capital investment. The City 
applied for, and received, a Commercial Community Development Block Grant to assist with the 
redevelopment of the building. The property owner plans to lease the building space to small 
businesses.  
 
The City also had a number of tax-exempt projects totaling $25.3 million in valuation including 
the construction of two schools by Unified School District No. 490 ($24.2 million), Butler 
County invested $829,000 in a facility expansion, and the Sunlight Children’s Advocacy 
purchased and renovated a building with a $345,000 capital investment.  
 
There were also a number of other projects that are important to the continuing the great 
investment environment in El Dorado and keeping the economic engine moving forward, 
although certain constraints prevent me from mentioning them in full detail. The City appreciates 
all investors who decided to invest capital in El Dorado in 2019 and looks forward to maintaining 
or growing the momentum in 2020. 
 
In 2019, the City experienced private development activity that contributed nearly $5.44 million 
in valuation. Four building permits were issued for new commercial development with an 
aggregate valuation of $0.76 million, compared to four new commercial developments in 2018 
with a valuation of $1.875 million. Also during the year, the City issued thirty-five building 
permits for commercial additions, remodels, and repairs with a valuation of $4.68 million. 
Comparatively, the City issued twenty-seven building permits for similar activity with a valuation 
of $21.5 million in 2018. 
 
The City issued nine residential building permits for new construction with a valuation of $1.52 
million. The City issued ten building permits for new residential construction in 2018 with a 
valuation of $1.86 million. Also during the year, eighty-nine building permits were issued for 
residential additions, remodels, and repairs, with a valuation of $1.01 million. In 2018, 104 
building permits were issued for the same activity with a valuation of $1.2 million.

As previously mentioned in this letter, the City of El Dorado broke the previously set retailers’ 
sales tax record set last year. The City brought in $2.649 million from retail sales occurring 
within the corporate limits of El Dorado. The total receipts also include compensation use tax 
proceeds, which are paid by individuals or businesses purchasing items outside El Dorado but 
that are delivered to El Dorado. The record-setting sales tax year provides a good indicator for the 
health of the economy.  
 
Similar to last year’s record collection, HollyFrontier’s second consecutive major turn-around 
brought thousands of contractors to El Dorado for a few weeks. The contractors stay in hotels, eat 
in local restaurants, and produce many retail sales during their stay. Much like old cowtowns at 
the end of the trail, El Dorado should seek to capture all the dollars in these contractors’ pockets 
while they temporarily reside in our great city. They contribute substantially to the local economy 
during their brief stay, and provide the means for the City to invest in parks and public facilities 
well after their departure.  
 
 
 
In 2018, one of El Dorado’s census tracts was designated as an Opportunity Zone under the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The designation provides special tax benefits on capital gains taxes 
for investors who invest in projects located within the Opportunity Zone geographical area. Such 
benefits include deferment of capital gains taxes for a number of years and possible forgiveness 
of certain capital gains meeting program requirements. Unfortunately, I cannot report that the 
creation of this special tax district has created much in the way of private investment in El 
Dorado. There has been one project that has capitalized on the Opportunity Zone designation, but 
no other projects have occurred (to the best of my knowledge) because of this incentive. For what 
it’s worth, I am told that other Kansas communities similar to El Dorado have been as successful 
in using this tool to attract private investment. 
 
***** 
 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The City also makes note of the following events that will affect the 2019 financial statements. 
 
Prairie Trails Golf Course. As previously mentioned, the anticipated sale of Prairie Trails Golf 
Course to GreatLife Golf and Fitness, LLC did not come to fruition. The City had to transition 
into management on May 1, 2020 just as the golf season was picking up momentum. Fortunately, 
111 annual passholders from GreatLife decided to continue with the City and purchased annual 
passes to play Prairie Trails. The passes will be billed to patrons monthly so the golf course will 
have a regular inflow of funds to help offset course operations.  
 
The City Commission’s ultimate goal is to market the property with the purpose of finding an 
interested party to purchase and operate Prairie Trails as a golf course. The City will obviously 
incur some expense during the initial transition and until a suitable buyer may be found. In the 
meantime, the City will seek to minimize the expense of managing Prairie Trails to reduce its 
impact on the operating budget. We’ll approach our management of the course like I approach my 
golf game by shooting for as low a score as possible. The General Fund did not budget to spend 
any money on Prairie Trails, so minimizing expenses will be essential to keeping finances reigned 
in for the year.  
 
Airport Lighting Project. Few in El Dorado may realize that the City owns and operates a 
federally-funded general aviation airport located about two miles south of town. The airport 
receives quite a bit of air traffic based on the amount of fuel sold at the airport. In 2019, the City 
sold 37,189 gallons of aviation fuel at Captain Jack Thomas Memorial Airport. 
 
The City, in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), had been planning a 
two capital projects to preserve the operation and safety of the air field. The projects replace the 
lighting systems at the airport. Lights, as it turns out, are essential for pilots to use an airport at 
dusk and in the evening hours; you have to see the runway to land without incident.  
 
The projects include lighting on both runways and the precision activated path indicator (PAPI) 
system at an estimated cost of $800,000. The FAA was originally going to pay 90% of this 
amount with the City responsible for the remaining $66,000. The projects later became the 
beneficiaries of CARES Act funding, and now the FAA will pay 100% of the cost for both of 
these projects. The total savings to the airport’s budget is $80,000, which equates to about 27% of 
the airport’s budget. 
 
 
 
Health Insurance. Health insurance seems to one area of the economy where inflation is not only 
the norm, but is the expectation. The City budgets for large increases to health insurance with the 
hope that our budgeted number is higher than the actual premiums required to insured our plan. A 
plan like this, however, is not without its failures. Any increase in health insurance premiums 
means fewer dollars spent on providing actual services to the public. The City, like many 
organizations, provides health insurance as a benefit to recruit and retain employees. The City’s 
plan does not align with the calendar year and seemingly effects two years. We are working to 
change the plan to a calendar year, and in the meantime will enroll in a six-month plan to get us 
through to the start of next 2020.  
 
From July 2019 to June of 2020, the City’s health insurance plan required premiums of $1.6 
million. These premiums represent real dollars that provide a benefit to employees and their 
families. Presently, the City of El Dorado pays nearly 75% of the premium on behalf of the 
employee. It’s a substantial expense, but one that we feel is both competitive and worthwhile. 
Keeping employees healthy ensures that the City may continue to provide quality public services 
to the community. The premiums for the City’s plan are expected to increase 5.9% through the 
end of 2020. 
 
COVID-19. It goes without saying that the COVID-19 pandemic caused much uncertainty for 
governments in 2020. The pandemic’s two-fold impact on public health and the economy will no 
doubt affect the City’s 2020 financial statements. To what degree, however, is still largely 
unknown. At the front end of the pandemic, the City revised its 2020 operating budget (as seen in 
the chart below) quite substantially in preparation for a significant economic downturn based on 
discussions from a wide variety of industry experts.

Savvy readers will note the increased expenditures in the General Fund while all other funds’ 
expenditures were revised down to reflect the possibility of an economic downturn. The General 
Fund expenses were increased due to the decision by the City Commission to resume operations 
at Prairie Trails Golf Course when GreatLife decided to discontinue its lease. The adopted 2020 
budget envisioned the sale of the golf course being completed, and so expenses had to increase to 
reflect this adjustment. Departmental budgets within the General Fund were, however, revised 
lower. 
 
I anticipated a significant economic impact resulting from decreasing business activity due to 
COVID-19. As I write this letter, the severity of the economic situation does not appear to be as 
dire as I had predicted. While service delivery changes may be painful to the community, I 
believe they were necessary in order to reduce the likelihood of full-time staff reductions should a 
significant economic downturn have occurred and the City’s financial resources are consequently 
depleted.  
 
Unfortunately, even the experts were mere amateurs in assessing the pandemic’s duration and 
scope. No one had the experience or insights needed to assist local governments craft a foolproof 
 
 
plan, so we did the next best thing and made an educated guess. Even so, the City had to prepare 
for a worst case scenario because failing to do so may have required even more difficult decisions 
had such a scenario came to fruition.  
 
There is still a lot we do not know about COVID-19 and its impact to the economy as I write this 
letter. The City has taken a number of calculated steps to mitigate its risk amid such uncertainty. 
For example, beginning May 1, 2020, I issued general guidance to employees outlining the 
following actions were to be taken to save money and prepare for the worst case scenario: 
 
 
All salary increases and promotions were suspended; 
 
Open positions were frozen and advertisement suspended (except for certain public safety 
positions); 
 
Large expenses, including fleet replacement, were deferred; 
 
Suspension of out-of-state travel and limited attendance to in-state conferences/training; 
 
Pre-approval of all out-of-city travel; 
 
Department budgets revised to defer certain expenses; 
 
Planned capital projects postponed or canceled (except for projects already under 
construction); 
 
Modification of work schedules to minimize overtime; 
 
Reductions to seasonal staff; and 
 
Voluntary early retirement offers were made available. 
The silver lining to the COVID-19 pandemic is that the City did not incur substantial expenses for 
our efforts to protect the public and employees. There may be federal funding to reimburse local 
governments for COVID-related expenses, although this remains to be seen from Washington, 
DC or Topeka. Nonetheless, the City continues to provide essential public services to the public 
even if we had to modify how these services were provided. It has been “interesting” to say the 
least. I think we can all tell our progeny that we lived the saying “may you live in interesting 
times.” There will be more to report to you in next year’s letter so stay tuned… 
 
***** 
Recognition 
It goes without saying that a municipal government cannot operate and provide public services 
without a dedicated workforce. The financial statements merely articulate the numbers associated 
with the provision of such public services; the employees of the City work each day towards the 
task of serving the public in a myriad of different ways that ultimately make El Dorado a great 
place to live, work, and play. On behalf of the City, I am extremely appreciative of their hard 
work and dedication in serving the citizens of El Dorado. Every community in the nation should 
be so blessed to have such a qualified and committed staff working to make the community a 
great place. Department Directors and supervisors are also commended for their efforts in leading 
the daily charge in the delivery of public services.  
 
The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded 
a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the City of El Dorado, 
Kansas for its comprehensive annual financial report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 
2018. This was the forty-first consecutive year that the municipal government has achieved this 
prestigious award. Not even the UCLA Bruins under the guidance of legendary Coach John 
Wooden can boast such a record. 
 
 
 
In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a municipal government must publish an 
easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual financial report. The report must 
satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements. It should 
also communicate the City’s financial condition in a manner that allows the public to understand 
such condition and affirm the City’s spending meets prudent standards and public expectations. I 
hope readers will find this year’s statements as enthralling as they are informative.  
 
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year period only. The City believes that the 
comprehensive annual financial report for year-ending December 31, 2019 continues to meet the 
Certificate of Achievement Program’s requirements and will submit it to the GFOA for 
consideration for another certificate.

RE: 
 
SUP – Home-Based Hair Salon at 111 S. Hogoboom Drive 
 
Nathan and Susan Dick are requesting a Special Use Permit (SUP) to allow a hair salon 
in their home at 111 S. Hogoboom Drive. The property is zoned R-1 Low Density 
Residential. The Supplementary District Regulations in the Zoning Ordinance allow a 
number of home occupations, with limitations, to occur in residential areas; the section 
calls this use “Barber and Beauty Services” and is allowed with a Special Use Permit.  
 
The applicants opened the proposed hair salon earlier this year. They were notified that a 
SUP is required and promptly submitted an application. They plan to operate weekday 
evenings and weekends by appointment only, with only one client at a time.  
 
Zoning Ordinance standards for review: 
 
A. The location and size of the proposed use in relation to the site and to adjacent 
sites and uses of the property, and the nature and intensity of operations proposed 
thereon.  The property consists of a single residential structure. Barber and beauty 
service operations are generally low intensity and do not create light, noise, or 
emissions. The property abuts agricultural land to the south, a hotel to the east and 
northeast, a vacant lot to the north, and a gas station and convenience store to the 
west. General commercial can be found farther to the east, north, and west along 
W. Central Avenue. No other residential properties are in the immediate area. 
 
B. Accessibility of the property to police, fire, refuse collection and other municipal 
services; adequacy of ingress and egress to and within the site;  traffic flow and 
control; and the adequacy of off-street parking and loading areas.  The site is 
accessible to all municipal services and has adequate parking for the proposed one 
client at a time. 
 
C. Utilities and services, including water, sewer, drainage, gas, and electricity, with 
particular reference to location, availability, capacity and compatibility.  
Additional utility demands will be minimal, if any. 
 
D. The location, nature, and height of structures, walls, fences, and other 
improvements; their relation to adjacent property and uses; and the need for 
buffering or screening.  No new structures are proposed. No buffering or 
screening are recommended. 
 
E. The adequacy of required yard and open space requirements and sign provisions. 
The Zoning Ordinance does not require any additional setbacks or open space.  
 
F. The general compatibility with adjacent properties, other properties in the 
district, and the general safety, health, comfort and general welfare of the 
community. Given the commercial nature of the area, the proposed land use is 
compatible with the area and will not detrimentally affect the welfare of the area.  
 
The intent of the Home Occupation regulations is to prevent a noticeable increase in 
traffic, parking, and noise in a residential neighborhood. As with all SUPs, conditions can 
be imposed on the permit. The City has issued SUPs for in-home beauty shops twice in 
the last decade, one in 2010 and the other in 2017. No conditions were imposed on the 
permits and staff are not aware of any complaints on file for the in-home businesses. 
 
Given the low impact nature of in-home beauty services and the commercial nature of the 
area, staff recommend approval of the SUP. Future renovations of the shop area and signs 
are subject to building codes and sign regulations, respectively, and will require separate 
permits. Approval of this Special Use Permit requires a majority vote of the Planning 
Commission members present and voting. 
 
Suggested Motion: 
 
I move to recommend approval of Case No. 20-03-SUP, a request by Nathan and 
Susan Dick, for a Special Use Permit to allow barber and beauty services on the 
property located 111 S. Hogoboom Drive, for the reasons set forth in the staff 
recommendation and heard at this public hearing.

Notice of Hearing for May 28th, 2020---Special Use Permit

Dear Mr. Shivers,   
 
We appreciate you mailing us a letter dated May 28th, 2020 for the public hearing,  
  
 
          This matter is brought before the interest of the Planning & Zoning Office at El Dorado City Hall, on 
behalf of Red Coach Inn and Suites. I am a representative of the business, and we have several questions and 
comments in regards to the issuance of a Special Use Permit for a hair salon at 111 W. Hogoboom Drive in El 
Dorado, KS. We are pro business; however we have a few valid concerns. 
  
3
          It has come to our attention, that parking along the access road will create major complications for our 
establishment and the Sunny Stop Gas Station along Hogoboom Drive. The LLC of the Red Coach Inn and 
Suites, has stated that they currently pay taxes for this access road, which is also not shared by the residence 
owners, nor the owners of Sunny Stop.  The concrete road in itself, needs fixed by the City of El Dorado.  It 
presents many problems for not only the Salon and the Gas Station, but ourselves included. Will these taxes for 
Hogoboom Drive be shared with the other businesses?  
  
          There is very little notable space for the Hair Salon's guests in the dirt driveway (a shed was placed 
there, allowing no extra room for parking for Salon establishment at the back) . It would also mean that their 
customers would be parking along our well maintained property, hindering Red Coach Inn guests access to 
their own rooms, and for truck parking that we have in the back of the property.  We already face challenges 
from Sunny Stop (and the sheds they have built in the back of their property that are not up to code) and Anitas 
Resturant who are using Red Coach property parking space on all 4 sides. Current residents of  111 W. 
Hogoboom Drive do not utilize their property Lights for safety of the premises. There is always litter around 
trees & their driveway is not sufficiently maintained. For example today, huge chunks of mud have spilled into 
Hogoboom Drive from their trucks tires and not cleaned as we type this email 4/30/20 6PM. I have attached 
pictures in this email.  Is this permit being obtained by the owner of the residence or the tenants? If so, do they 
have the permission from current landlords? What is the disposal process for chemicals and human waste 
associated with this type of business? 
 
In the past, 111 W. Hogoboom Drive has been plagued by homeless people residing in it before it was bought 
by the current owners. They had verbally stated they would have the properties fence updated and fixed. This 
has not happened. We are extremely concerned of illegal parking and traffic that will trespass our West 
Building and behind the South Building. We have had several costly items stolen from the vicinity and we are 
concerned for the future.  
 
Our suggestion is there are several vacant buildings for rent in Shopping Complexes on Central avenue that are 
can be rented professionally with good parking space. 
  
Thank you for your time and consideration.

RE: 
 
SUP – Accessory Apartment at 3625 SW 10th Street 
 
Terrysa Moore is requesting a Special Use Permit (SUP) to allow an accessory apartment 
on the property at 3625 SW 10th Street. The zoning ordinance defines accessory 
apartment as “an accessory use residential unit that is located detached from a principal 
single-family residential unit.” The property is zoned A-R Agricultural Residential 
District. A SUP is required to build an accessory apartment in A-R zoning districts. The 
applicant is interested in constructing a second residential structure on the property.  
 
The property is located in the City of El Dorado’s Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ), also 
known as the Growth Area. The City of El Dorado has jurisdiction over land uses within 
this area. However, all building permits are issued by Butler County.  
 
The standards that must be met and staff recommendations are as follows: 
 
A. The location and size of the proposed use in relation to the site and to adjacent 
sites and uses of the property, and the nature and intensity of operations proposed 
thereon.  The property is surrounded by agricultural uses and low-density rural 
residential with oil and gas bulk storage farther to the west and the Turnpike to 
the northwest. 
 
B. Accessibility of the property to police, fire, refuse collection and other municipal 
services; adequacy of ingress and egress to and within the site;  traffic flow and 
control; and the adequacy of off-street parking and loading areas.  The site is 
accessible by all emergency services.   
 
C. Utilities and services, including water, sewer, drainage, gas, and electricity, with 
particular reference to location, availability, capacity and compatibility.  The 
property is served by public water and will have on-site sewage treatment. 
 
D. The location, nature, and height of structures, walls, fences, and other 
improvements; their relation to adjacent property and uses; and the need for 
buffering or screening. The applicant has not finalized a home size at this time. 
 
E. The adequacy of required yard and open space requirements and sign provisions. 
The final site plan will be reviewed by Butler County. However, staff expect the 
proposed residence to exceed setback requirements. 
 
F. The general compatibility with adjacent properties, other properties in the 
district, and the general safety, health, comfort and general welfare of the 
community. Given the predominance of agricultural land around property, the 
large lot area, and the minor increase in density, it is staff’ opinion that a second 
dwelling unit is compatible with the area.  
 
Staff recommends approval of the Special Use Permit. The Butler County Commission 
will review the case at their May 26th meeting and vote to make a recommendation.  
 
Approval of this Special Use Permit requires a majority vote of the Planning Commission 
members present and voting. 
 
Suggested Motion: 
 
I move to recommend approval of Case No. 20-04-SUP, a request by Terrysa Moore, 
for a Special Use Permit to allow an accessory apartment on the property located at

RE: 
 
SUP – Campground at 1139 SE Bluestem Road 
 
Natalie and Tim Donges are requesting a Special Use Permit (SUP) to allow a 
campground at 1139 SE Bluestem Road. The property is currently zoned Manufactured 
Home Park Residential District (M-P). The zoning regulations define campground as 
“establishments primarily engaged in providing overnight or short-term camping sites for 
recreational vehicles, travel trailers, campers, or tents.” The campground use is only 
allowed by SUP in C-1 General Business and M-P Manufactured Home Park Residential 
Districts.  
 
The request will allow Deer Grove RV Park, on the north side of the subject property, to 
expand southward. 1139 SE Bluestem is a 4.5-acre lot primarily used for mobile homes. 
The applicants plan to connect this lot to their existing Deer Grove RV Park. 
 
The property is located in the City of El Dorado’s Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ), also 
known as the Growth Area. The City of El Dorado has jurisdiction over land uses within 
this area. However, all building permits are issued by Butler County. 
 
Zoning Ordinance standards for review: 
 
A. The location and size of the proposed use in relation to the site and to adjacent 
sites and uses of the property, and the nature and intensity of operations proposed 
thereon.  The proposed use is short-term recreational vehicle parking. The lot 
abuts existing RV parking to the north and northwest, mobile homes to the west, 
low-density residential to the south, low-density residential and a storage facility 
to the east across Bluestem Road, and low-density residential to the northeast. 
 
B. Accessibility of the property to police, fire, refuse collection and other municipal 
services; adequacy of ingress and egress to and within the site;  traffic flow and 
control; and the adequacy of off-street parking and loading areas.  The site is 
accessible to all services. The site will continue to use Highway 54 for primary 
ingress and egress. The applicants plan to close the access to Bluestem Road. 
 
C. Utilities and services, including water, sewer, drainage, gas, and electricity, with 
particular reference to location, availability, capacity and compatibility.  The 
property is currently served by public water and sewer utilities. 
 
D. The location, nature, and height of structures, walls, fences, and other 
improvements; their relation to adjacent property and uses; and the need for 
buffering or screening.  No new permanent structures are proposed. RV parking 
spaces will have electric, water, and sewer connections.  
 
E. The adequacy of required yard and open space requirements and sign provisions. 
The zoning ordinance requires a 30 foot buffer along property lines. RVs are 
much shorter in length than the existing mobile homes and will be able to meet 
the 30 foot requirement. 
 
F. The general compatibility with adjacent properties, other properties in the 
district, and the general safety, health, comfort and general welfare of the 
community. The proposed land use is consistent with development in the 
immediate area.  
 
The proposed RV Park expansion meets the requirements of the zoning ordinance and 
provides appropriate buffer space from adjacent properties. The applicant is not 
proposing any new buildings as customers will have full access to the existing laundry, 
bathroom, and storm shelter facilities in the RV park to the north. The park will continue 
to have direct access to Highway 54. City staff recommend approval of the SUP 
application. Approval of this Special Use Permit requires a majority vote of the Planning 
Commission members present and voting. 
 
Suggested Motion: 
 
I move to recommend approval of Case No. 20-05-SUP, a request by Natalie and Tim 
Donges, for a Special Use Permit to allow a campground on the property located 
1139 SE Bluestem Road, for the reasons set forth in the staff recommendation and 
heard at this public hearing.

Mr. Shivers asked to start with item number two. 
 
ITEM NO. 2 – CASE NO. 20-04-SUP: PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE CONSIDERATION 
OF A REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL USE PERMIT TO ALLOW AN ACCESSORY 
APARTMENT AT 3625 SW 10TH STREET. 
 
1. Presentation of Request 
 
Mr. Shivers reviewed the staff memo and said the SUP request is for a second home. Mr. Shivers 
said Butler County will review and approve the specific building plans and issue a building 
permit. 
 
The applicant, Terrysa (Moore) Carleton and Suzette Moore, said the land would remain 
agricultural and want to use the minimum amount of space for the house. They will connect to 
rural water and use the existing lagoon for sewage requirements. Evergy has approved new 
services for this location. 
 
Commissioner Long asked if they would access the home from 10th Street. Ms. Moore said they 
would use the access road to the east. There is an existing small drive where they store hay bales. 
The access road is shared by the adjacent property owners and used by an oil company to access 
their infrastructure. 
 
Commissioner Leason asked about the SUP requirements. Mr. Shivers said A-R zoning requires 
minimum 40 acre lots and is made for agriculture. The zoning allows one home on the property. 
A SUP can allow a second home in lieu of platting or rezoning the property. 
 
Chairman Tetrick asked to clarify accessory apartment. Mr. Shivers said it is a single-family 
home, not multi-family. The term itself is confusing and will likely be updated to something like 
Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in the next zoning ordinance update. 
 
2. Public Hearing 
 
Chairman Tetrick opened the public hearing. There being no one to speak, the public hearing 
was closed. 
 
3. Discussion by Planning Commission 
 
Mr. Shivers followed up on Commissioner Long’s questions about access. He said they can use 
the access road as long as they have access to public right-of-way in the event that situation 
changes. 
 
4. Motion 
 
Commissioner Long moved to recommend approval of Case No. 20-04-SUP, a request by 
Terrysa Moore, for a Special Use Permit to allow an accessory apartment on the property located 
at 3625 SW 10th Street, for the reasons set forth in the staff recommendation and heard at this 
public hearing, seconded by Commissioner Hackler.

ITEM NO. 3 – CASE NO. 20-05-SUP: PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE CONSIDERATION 
OF A REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL USE PERMIT TO ALLOW CAMPGROUND AT 
1139 SE BLUESTEM. 
 
1. Presentation of Request 
 
Mr. Shivers review the staff memo and said the site is currently built out and the road and 
utilities will not change. The spaces will change over to RV parking spaces and the hookups will 
be updated. Generally, no new infrastructure is needed. 
 
Tim Donges, applicant, said it’s a natural fit for their business. They plan to close access to 
Bluestem because the industry promotes one entrance/exit. All traffic will be funneled by their 
office to Highway 54. 
 
2. Public Hearing 
 
Chairman Tetrick opened the public hearing. There being no one to speak, the hearing was 
closed. 
 
3. Discussion by Planning Commission 
 
Commissioner Stewart asked about access to the new addition. Mrs. Donges said the mobile 
home park to the west is also their property, there is a drive along the property line that provides 
access throughout the park. 
 
Commissioner Long asked about timelines. Mrs. Donges said hopefully it will be complete 
within the next year. Covid-19 slowed business due to lack of travel.  
 
Commissioner Long asked if the existing mobile homes will stay in the park. Mrs. Donges said 
they can stay until they decide to move on, they are good tenants.  
 
Commissioner Hackler asked if there’s any concerns about closing Bluestem access and having 
one access road. Mr. Donges said they have to meet National Fire Protection Association 
(NFPA) requirements, including roads that allow emergency vehicle access. Road width is 
already wide enough for emergency access. They said the RVs getting in and out might be bigger 
than fire trucks. Mr. Donges said it’s similar to neighborhoods like Vintage Place, where there’s 
homes at the back of the neighborhood.  
 
Commissioner Stewart asked about the letter from the County. Mr. Shivers said the park has had 
small numbers of RVs coming and going over the years. Mr. Shivers recommended they apply 
for a SUP if they want to convert the park to all RVs. RVs on the property are nonconforming 
and nonconforming uses are not allowed to expand.  
 
4. Motion 
 
Commissioner Leason moved to recommend approval of Case No. 20-05-SUP, a request by 
Natalie and Tim Donges, for a Special Use Permit to allow a campground on the property 
located 1139 SE Bluestem Road, for the reasons set forth in the staff recommendation and heard 
at this public hearing, seconded by Commissioner Stewart.

ITEM NO. 1 – CASE NO. 20-03-SUP: PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE CONSIDERATION 
OF A REQUEST FOR A SPECIAL USE PERMIT TO ALLOW BARBER AND BEAUTY 
SERVICES AT 111 S. HOGOBOOM DRIVE. 
 
1. Presentation of Request 
 
Mr. Shivers reviewed the staff memo and said the proposed use itself fits in the with the area, it 
is the residential property that is unusual for this location. He said the applicants are planning to 
operate weekday evenings and weekends, one customer at a time. No new structures are 
proposed. 
 
The applicants planned to attend the meeting but had a family emergency. 
 
Commissioner Long asked where clients will park. Mr. Shivers said in the driveway, it is small 
and holds two cars. It is similar to the S. Audrey SUP that also had two parking spaces and they 
enclosed the garage for the hair salon. 
 
Chairman Tetrick asked about on-street parking. Scott Rickard said the roadway is wide and 
private property, prescriptive in nature. He’s talked to the land owners. Commissioner Stewart 
asked about an access easement. Mr. Rickard said that’s between the landowners. Mr. Rickard 
said it has been in existence to allow access, called a prescriptive easement, and the applicant is 
not aware of a recorded agreement. The former owner of the hotel is not aware of any 
agreements either. It has been an access road since 1959 when the home was built. The City has 
a water line along the roadway and a sewer line that crosses it. Mr. Rickard said we have similar 
situations in town, like County Club Lane, that is developed with homes and the golf course but 
is not a public right-of-way. Mr. Shivers said the east end of Park Lane also has a lot removed 
from the right-of-way that has access by a prescriptive easement. 
 
Commissioner Hackler asked if there is a danger of the hotel banning cars parked on the road. 
Mr. Shivers passed around a photo of the driveway. Mr. Shivers said the Planning Commission 
has the ability require specific parking requirements 
 
Commissioner Stewart said they need to be able to meet the zoning requirements and didn’t see a 
need to add requirements. Mr. Shivers said if the homeowners park on the street and clients park 
the driveway, that condition would be hard to enforce. 
 
2. Public Hearing 
 
Chairman Tetrick opened the public hearing. There being no one to speak, the hearing was 
closed. 
 
3. Discussion by Planning Commission 
 
Commissioner Stewart and Hackler expressed concerns about the access. Commissioner Hackler 
said he understood the access was grandfathered, but wasn’t sure about parking. 
 
Commissioner Leason asked about parking requirements. Mr. Shivers said they are required to 
provide two parking spaces by regulation. Commissioner Stewart asked if the in-home salon 
requires another space. Mr. Shivers said another space is not required by ordinance. 
 
Commissioner Hackler asked about business hours. Mr. Shivers said evenings and weekends, it 
will not be a full time business. 
 
Chairman Tetrick asked if they can bring in other employees. Mr. Shivers said it can only be 
operated by the owner. 
 
Mr. Shivers said they just started operating before the pandemic and Mr. Rickard notified them 
of the SUP requirement. They immediately applied. Mr. Rickard said he didn’t think they had 
any clients and then the pandemic shut things down. 
 
4. Motion 
 
Commissioner Hackler moved to recommend approval of Case No. 20-03-SUP, a request by 
Nathan and Susan Dick, for a Special Use Permit to allow barber and beauty services on the 
property located 111 S. Hogoboom Drive, for the reasons set forth in the staff recommendation 
and heard at this public hearing, seconded by Commissioner Leason.

Consideration of the Award of Bids for CDBG Commercial Project at 142 N. Main Street 
DATE:  
June 8, 2020 
 
Background: 
The owner of the property at 142 N. Main St was awarded a CDBG grant for a Commercial Rehabilitation Project from 
the Kansas Department of Commerce.  The City Commission must approve the bid for the project since funds for this 
project will pass through the State to the City for reimbursement to the owner. The project consists of a fire suppression 
system, new roof, and drainage impartments for the basement. Martsolf Enterprises was the lone bidder with a project cost 
of $325,504.34 
 
Project Schedule:  
It is anticipated that work will begin and take a few months to complete as soon as a contract is in place. 
 
Attachments: 
Letter to the Kansas Department of Commerce requesting approval of a sole source bid. 
 
Policy Issue: 
Per state requirements, the City Commission must award the bid for this project and direct the mayor to sign the sole 
source request. 
 
Alternatives: 
The City Commission may either accept the bid as presented or elect to deny approval of the bid and request a new letting 
date. The project has been bid three different times because the architect and owner have had a difficult time finding 
interested bidders. 
 
Fiscal Impact: 
Project will be funded entirely from grant dollars and the owner’s private investment.   
 
Trade-offs: 
Failure to approve the bid may result in the project not receiving grant funds. The property owner would then have to fully 
fund the improvements with private capital. 
 
Staff Recommendation: 
Staff recommends the City Commission accept the bid as presented and authorize the mayor to sign the sole source letter. 
 
Commission Actions: 
 
Commissioner ________________ moves to accept the bid of Martsolf Enterprises in the amount of $325,504.34 for the 
rehabilitation of 142 N. Main Street and request sole source bid approval from the Kansas Department of Commerce, 
subject to meeting the requirements of the CDBG Commercial Rehabilitation Grant Program.    
 
Commissioner ___________ seconded the motion.

Dear Mr. Gale: 
 
The City of El Dorado, Kansas, is writing to request a sole source bid award. 
 
See attached contractors bid, list of companies that the bid packet were sent to, 
bid opening sign in sheet, and bid opening tabulation.  
 
Unfortunately, only one contractor submitted a bid. Our request is permission 
to award 142 N. Main to Martsolf Enterprises in the amount of 325,504.35 as 
this was a sole source bid. 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely,

SUBJ:  
Consideration of the Vacation of Public Right-of-Way within the Hull’s Addition 
DATE:  
June 8, 2020 
 
Background: 
At the request of an adjacent property owner, the City is requesting the City Commission consider the vacation of a 
platted alley in the Hull’s Addition.  The alley runs North and South from 9th Avenue to 10th Avenue between Taylor 
Street and Washington Street.  In the opinion of staff, the alley serves no purpose as a public right-of-way and staff feels it 
is justified to vacate the alley.  As platted the alley is 16-foot in width and when vacated would convert to private property 
with an underlying 16-foot utility easement in the same alignment. 
 
Staff has reached out to all franchised utilities and adjacent property owners for seeking input on the proposed alley 
vacation.  The resident at 1012 N. Taylor Street was against the vacation due to a potential increase in property taxes.  
Staff spoke to the Butler County Appraiser and was given a high end estimate of $10 per year for the increase in land 
owned after the vacation.  No franchised utilities expressed any concerns over the proposal. 
 
Project Schedule:  
The vacation would be effective thirty-one days following publication of the approved ordinance.  Interested parties may 
file a written protest within those thirty-one days, and if such protest is filed, the City Commission must set a hearing and 
consider adoption of a resolution authorizing the vacation. 
 
Attachments: 
See Ordinance and Location Map 
 
Policy Issue: 
Per K.S.A. 12-512(a), cities may vacate any street, avenue, alley, or lane, or part thereof, and may reserve to the city and 
public utilities such rights-of-way and easements as in the judgment of the governing body are necessary or desirable for 
public service. 
 
Alternatives: 
The City Commission may either accept staff’s recommendation and proceed with the proposed vacation, or the 
governing body may elect to retain the public right-of-way as originally platted in 1918. 
 
Fiscal Impact: 
Publication of the Ordinance is estimated to be $100.  The increase in property tax paid to the City would be negligible.   
 
Staff Recommendation: 
Staff recommends the public right-of-way, as described in the ordinance, be approved by the City Commission.  
 
 
Commission Actions: 
 
Commissioner ________________ moves to adopt Ordnance No. ____, an ordinance vacating an alley in Hull’s Addition 
to the City of El Dorado and reserving a permanent utility easement.   
 
Commissioner ___________ seconded the motion.
