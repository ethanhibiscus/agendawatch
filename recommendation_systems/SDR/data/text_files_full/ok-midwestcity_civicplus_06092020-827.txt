MEMORANDUM 
 
 
 
TO: 
 
Honorable Mayor and Council 
 
FROM:  
Brandon Clabes, Chief of Police 
 
DATE:  
June 9, 2020 
 
SUBJECT: 
Discussion and consideration of entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Oklahoma 
Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for FY 20/21, which establishes the 
terms, and conditions under which the City participates in this program to identify eligible municipal 
offenders in Midwest City who are in need of behavioral health treatment services.  The program is 
being funded entirely by the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, 
including supplies necessary to operate the screening program such as a computer or drug testing 
supplies. 
 
The Midwest City Police Department operates the largest municipal jail in Oklahoma.  It is a proven fact that a large 
percentage of these individuals suffer from mental health or substance abuse issues but are unable or unwilling to get 
necessary treatment.  The City of Midwest City continues to work with the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health 
and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) through an innovative project that identifies eligible municipal offenders 
who are in need of behavioral health treatment services.  In addition, the offenders who are approved for the program 
are linked to appropriate services and monitored for treatment compliance and substance abstinence.  Statistics at this 
point shows the program is having positive results. 
 
Successful completion of the program, known as the Diversion Project, could result in incentives to the participants 
that could potentially include misdemeanor charge reductions and dismissals.  Also, it provides a foundation for the 
participant to become a productive citizen in society and reduce recidivism, not only in our facility but others throughout 
the state.  This obviously lowers jail operating costs and population numbers. 
 
As part of the MOU, the City of Midwest City agrees to provide office space for a full time ODMHSAS certified, 
contracted treatment provider to coordinate the Diversion Project.  ODMHSAS will provide the entire financial 
responsibility of the Diversion Project; and provide training and analytical data for evaluation purposes.  As stated 
earlier, there is no cost to the City of Midwest City this fiscal year. 
 
This continues to be the first of its kind at a municipal level and possibly a national model to be used throughout the 
United States. 
 
Staff recommends approval.

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN CITATION: 
Office/Retail Land Use 
Retail land uses areas are intended to provide for a variety of retail trade, personal, and 
business services and establishments.  Retail establishments generally require greater 
visibility than do other types of non-residential land uses (e.g., office, commercial). 
 
 
 
Page 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   June 9, 2020 
PC-2044 
 
Office uses include professional offices for lawyers, doctors, realtors, and other 
professionals.  Office land uses are generally appropriate in all other non-residential areas 
of the City.  Office development should be compatible with any adjacent residential area. 
 
MUNICIPAL CODE CITATION: 
2.20 Community Commercial 
2.20.1. General Description 
This commercial district is intended for the conduct of business activity which is located 
at the edge of residential areas but which serves a larger trade area than the immediately 
surrounding residential neighborhoods.  
 
Business uses will most often be found in a wide variety of commercial structures, 
normally on individual sites with separate ingress, egress, and parking. Because of the 
varied uses permitted, it is important to be separated as much as possible visually and  
physically from any nearby residential areas and to limit the harmful effects of increased 
traffic, noise, and general nonresidential activity which will be generated.  
 
Traffic generated by the uses permitted shall be primarily passenger vehicles and only 
those trucks and commercial vehicles required for stocking and delivery of retail goods.  
 
7.6. Special Use Permit  
7.6.1. Special Use Permit 
The uses listed under the various districts as special use permits are so classified because 
they more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other uses 
permitted in the district. 
 
(A) 
Consideration for compatibility 
With consideration given to the setting, physical features, compatibility with 
surrounding  land uses, traffic, and aesthetics, certain uses may locate in an area 
where they will be compatible with existing or planned land uses.  
(B) Review and approval 
The Planning Commission shall review each case on its own merit, apply the criteria                            
established herein, and recommend either approval or denial of the special use permit 
to the City Council. Following the Planning Commission’s recommendation, the City 
Council shall review each case on its own merit, apply the criteria established herein, 
and, if appropriate, authorize said use by granting a special use permit.  
(C) Use identified by individual zoning district 
If a special use permit is granted it shall be for all the uses permitted in the specified 
district plus the special use permit requested.  
 
7.6.3 Criteria for Special Use Permit Approval 
(A) 
Special use permit criteria 
The City Council shall use the following criteria to evaluate a special use permit: 
1) Whether the proposed use shall be in harmony with the policies of the 
comprehensive plan.  
2) Whether the proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose and 
intent of the applicable zoning district regulations.  
3) Whether the proposed use shall not adversely affect the use of neighboring 
properties.  
 
 
Page 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   June 9, 2020 
PC-2044 
 
4) Whether the proposed use shall not generate pedestrian and vehicular traffic 
that is hazardous or in conflict with the existing and anticipated traffic in the 
neighborhood.  
5) Whether utility, drainage, parking, loading, signs, lighting access and other 
necessary public facilities to serve the proposed use shall meet the adopted 
codes of the city.  
 
NOTIFICATION: 
1.  Written notice was mailed to owners of real property within 300 feet of the 
exterior boundaries of the subject property. 
 
HISTORY: 
1. This area was zoned C-3, with the adoption of the 1985 Zoning Map and remains 
so designated on the 2010 Zoning Map. 
2. The Planning Commission recommended approval of this item June 2, 2020. 
 
STAFF COMMENTS: 
Fire Marshal’s Comments: 
The property is required to meet and maintain the requirements of Midwest City 
Ordinances Section 15.  
 
Planning Division: 
As noted in the Executive Summary, this Special Use Permit is required as the applicant 
is proposing to sell alcoholic beverages within the new restaurant.  
 
As of this writing, staff has not received any calls or letters of protest regarding this 
rezoning request. 
 
The proposed use is classified within the Midwest City Zoning Ordinance as Eating 
Establishments: Sit-Down, Alcoholic Beverages Permitted. This category states that on-
premise consumption of alcohol is accessory to the restaurant operation.  
 
As mentioned above, criteria for special use permit approval is outlined in 7.6.3. of the 
Midwest City Zoning Ordinance. Below are staff’s opinions as to how this application 
meets or does not meet the required criteria: 
1. The Comprehensive Plan states that one of the three basic targets of economic 
development programming retaining and increasing the viability of existing local 
businesses. Allowing this Special Use Permit will allow this new business to 
occupy a space that has been vacant for several years which is consistent with the 
targets of the Comprehensive Plan. 
2. The proposed use is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the C-3 
zoning district regulations as it is located in a commercial area and mostly 
surrounded by commercial uses. 
3. The proposed use is not likely to adversely affect the neighboring properties. The 
applicant will be required to adhere to all laws regarding serving alcoholic 
beverages to patrons.  
4. Staff does not believe that the proposed use will generate pedestrian and vehicular 
traffic that is hazardous or in conflict with the existing and anticipated traffic in the 
neighborhood. The area of request is already zoned C-3 and the traffic generated 
from this use would likely not change much from the existing daily traffic.

   June 9, 2020 
PC-2044 
 
5. Utility, drainage, parking, loading, signs, lighting access and other necessary public 
facilities are all existing and will not be affected by this proposed use.  
 
Action is at the discretion of the Planning Commission and City Council. 
 
Action Required:   Approve or reject the resolution for a Special Use Permit for the 
property as noted herein, subject to the staff comments as found in the June 9, 2020 
agenda packet and made a part of PC- 2044 file.

A line of credit loan for up to $200,000 split equally between Fund 123 - Park and Recreation and Fund 45 - Welcome Center was approved by City Council on April 9, 2019 to provide the cash for
continuing golf course operations.  The loan is payable in a balloon payment on April 30, 2024.  Fund balance is negative because the liability for the loan has been recorded.  However, the
loan will provide the cash balance needed to continue operations.

TO:           Mayor and Council  
FROM:     Heather Poole, City Attorney 
Date:         June 9, 2020 
Subject:     Discussion and consideration of Resolution stating the City’s opposition to 
discrimination based upon gender identity and/or gender expression. 
 
At the request of Councilmember Sean Reed, a Resolution has been prepared for consideration by 
City Council to address the City’s stance opposing any discrimination based on gender identity.  
While discrimination based on sex is a protected class under both federal and state law neither 
“sexual orientation” or “gender identity” or “gender expression” are considered state or federal 
protected classes.  A degree of protection is afforded under the umbrella of “sex” and “gender” 
discrimination has been extended in some jurisdictions. As an employer, the United States 
government has extended those protections as well as the following cities: Austin, TX; Ft Worth, 
TX; Norman, OK; Oklahoma City, OK; Omaha, NE; St. Louis, MO; and Tulsa, OK.  A number of 
large employers in the region have also taken steps to address gender identity in their policies: OU 
Health Science Center; University of Central Oklahoma; SSM Health and Midfirst Bank. The City 
of Midwest City’s Council wants to join with these other entities to express its opposition to 
discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Respectfully,

Subject: Discussion and consideration of declaring unit # 43-05-10, a 2015 Vermeer HG4000 
horizontal grinder, surplus property and authorizing its disposal per trade-in value of 
$300,000.00 toward the purchase of a new Vermeer HG6000 horizontal grinder and 
approving the purchase per State Contract SW196, in the amount of $391,107.66. 
 
Unit # 43-05-10 from the wastewater department is unreliable and too costly to maintain.  Vermeer 
has agreed to take this unit in on trade so we can purchase a new horizontal grinder for the operation 
of the Compost Facility, which is required for bio-solids disposal, a process regulated by the 
Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ).   
 
We recommend declaring this unit surplus property and authorizing its disposal as a $300,000.00 
trade-in on the purchase of a new Vermeer HG6000 horizontal grinder.  The equipment estimate 
quote that includes the purchase price and trade-in value is attached for reference. 
 
1. Unit # 43-05-10 VIN # 1VRC312H2F1001005, A 2015 Vermeer Model HG4000 horizontal
