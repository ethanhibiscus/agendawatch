efficiently restore and revitalize systems and services to support a viable, resilient community.
•
Long-Term Vulnerability Reduction:  Build and sustain resilient systems, communities, and critical
infrastructure and key resources lifelines so as to reduce their vulnerability to natural, technological, and
human-caused threats and hazards by lessening the likelihood, severity, and duration of the adverse
consequences.
•
Mass Search & Rescue Operations:  Deliver traditional and atypical search and rescue capabilities, including
personnel, services, animals, and assets to survivors in need, with the goal of saving the greatest number of
endangered lives in the shortest time possible.
•
On-Scene Security, Protection, & Law Enforcement:  Ensure a safe and secure environment through law
enforcement and related security and protection operations for people and communities located within
affected areas and also for response personnel engaged in lifesaving and life-sustaining operations.

process that appropriately integrates all critical stakeholders and supports the execution of Core 
Capabilities. 
• 
Planning:  Conduct a systematic process engaging the whole community as appropriate in the development 
of executable strategic, operational, and/or tactical-level approaches to meet defined objectives. 
• 
Public Health, Healthcare, & Emergency Medical Services:  Provide lifesaving medical treatment via 
Emergency Medical Services and related operations, and avoid additional disease and injury by providing 
targeted public health, medical, and behavioral health support and products to all affected populations. 
• 
Public Information & Warning:  Deliver coordinated, prompt, reliable, and actionable information to the 
whole community through the use of clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically 
appropriate methods to effectively relay information regarding any threat or hazard and, as appropriate, 
the actions being taken and the assistance being made available. 
• 
Risk & Disaster Resilience Assessment:  Assess risk and disaster resilience so that decision makers, 
responders, and community members can take informed action to reduce their entity’s risk and increase its 
resilience. 
• 
Situational Assessment:  Provide all decision makers with decision-relevant information regarding the 
nature and extent of the hazard, any cascading effects, and the status of the response. 
• 
Threats & Hazards Identification:  Identify the threats and hazards that occur in the geographic area; 
determine the frequency and magnitude; and incorporate this into analysis and planning processes so as to 
clearly understand the needs of a community or entity. 
 
Section 2:  Proposed 2020-2021 SECB Grant Program Projects 
In partnership with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety - Emergency Communication Networks Division 
(MN DPS-ECN), the Statewide Emergency Communications Board (SECB) provides grant funding to support

Response Plan” and other COVID-19 resources developed by the National Emergency Number Association
(NENA), cellular communication resources available to support response efforts, etc.).
•
Engaging in regular communication and coordination with service providers and industry partners.
•
Submitting daily reports to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) regarding COVID-19 related
impacts on emergency communications and PSAP operations.
•
Facilitating regular communication with PSAP personnel in several ECB/ESB regions to share information,
identify best practices, and promote a regional approach to continuity of operations planning.
•
Providing COVID-19 hazard location information to PSAPs in support of Governor Walz’s Emergency
Executive Order 20-34 (Protecting Minnesota's First Responders by Directing the Commissioner of Health
