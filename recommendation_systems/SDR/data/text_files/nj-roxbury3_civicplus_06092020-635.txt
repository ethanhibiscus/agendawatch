The Honorable Robert DeFillippo 
Township of Roxbury, Morris County 
1715 Route 46  
Ledgewood, NJ  07876 
RE: Proposed Land Exchange between Morris County, Morris County Park Commission and NJDEP: 
Jefferson, Denville, Roxbury and Rockaway Townships 
Dear Mayor DeFillippo: 
The New Jersey Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council (Highlands Council), in accordance 
with the Ogden-Rooney Statute (C.13:1D-58, Nonapplicability of C.1D-51 et seq.; hearing, determination), 
is providing this letter as consultation with your municipality regarding the referenced land exchange.   
The County of Morris (County), the Morris County Park Commission (Commission) and the New Jersey 
Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish and Wildlife (NJDEP) propose to exchange 
approximately 405.019 acres of land owned by the County and the Commission in Jefferson, Roxbury, and 
Rockaway Townships, Morris County, for approximately 486.765 acres of land in Denville Township, 
Morris County, 52.924 acres of which are owned in full by the NJDEP and 433.841 of which are jointly 
owned by the NJDEP, the County, and Denville Township.  The NJDEP’s share of ownership of the 
Denville tract totals approximately 235.576 acres, therefore the total acreage proposed to be exchanged by 
the NJDEP is approximately 288.50 acres.  
The County and the Commission’s objective for the proposed land exchange is to obtain complete 
ownership of lands which they purchased jointly with the NJDEP and which they currently manage as 
open space for public use.  The NJDEP’s objective is to expand its holdings at the Berkshire Valley 
Wildlife Management Area (WMA) for administration as part of the Division of Fish and Wildlife’s WMA 
system, and to divest its ownership of jointly owned land already adequately managed by the County.  As a 
result of this exchange, the NJDEP will obtain a separate parcel to add to its contiguous holdings at the 
Wildcat Ridge WMA for administration as part of the Division of Fish and Wildlife’s WMA system.    
In total, there are 892 acres of land being exchanged.  Highlands Council staff conducted a resource 
assessment to determine if the land exchange would significantly alter the ecological and environmental 
value of the lands being exchanged, in accordance with Ogden-Rooney.  This assessment was conducted 
with respect to the Highlands Regional Master Plan (RMP) and the resources inventoried therein.  
SCHEDULE  A

May 14, 2020 
Page 2 
In summary, the resources across all the properties proposed for exchange are of equivalent value, 
ecologically. All are forested parcels and contain resources such as Highlands Open Waters, and associated 
buffers, critical wildlife habitat for rare, threatened and endangered species, steep slopes, wetlands, prime 
groundwater recharge area, scenic resources, forest resource area, riparian area and archaeological 
resources.  
In Roxbury Township, only one parcel is part of the land exchange, Block 13302 Lot 1.  This parcel is 3.31 
acres in size, lies within the Preservation Area of the Highlands Region and is currently owned by Morris 
County Parks Commission.  It will be conveyed to NJDEP as part of the land exchange.  It is surrounded 
by other NJDEP lands and will be managed as part of the Berkshire Valley Wildlife Management Area, in 
accordance with the NJDEP Division of Fish and Wildlife lands management program.   
It is understood, based on consultation with NJDEP staff, that no alternation to the ecological and 
environmental value of the lands is anticipated to occur as a result of the land exchange.  Therefore, the 
Highlands Council has made the determination that this exchange is consistent with the Highlands Act and 
RMP.  
By your acknowledgment of this letter, the Highlands Council can confirm consultation with your 
municipality so that you are aware and fully apprised of the exchange. We will convey the finding that this 
exchange is consistent with the RMP to the County of Morris, the Morris County Parks Commission and 
the NJDEP.   
Please provide your confirmation of this consultation, by signing below and returning it to me, at the 
address in the letterhead. If you have any questions regarding this finding, or need further information, 
please do not hesitate to contact me at (908) 879-6737 or via email lisa.plevin@highlands.nj.gov.

Lisa J. Plevin

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 
The Township wishes to replace the existing carpet at town hall. Due to the age of the 
carpet as well as the potential for future trip hazards it is suggested to replace with new 
carpeting. Township employees will assist in the removal of all office furniture prior to 
and during the installation process. Based on the competitive unit pricing contained in 
this contract it is recommended to authorize a contract to Commercial Interiors Direct 
Inc. for services rendered in the installation and removal of new carpeting. The labor for 
services provided by Commercial Interiors Direct Inc. at town hall is based on straight 
time pricing not to exceed $54,063.97. 
The broadloom carpet material will be purchased through Commercial Interiors Direct 
Inc. due to manufacturer restrictions. The price for the broadloom carpet material is 
$9,062.85. 
Due to the cost savings of attaining the carpet tile product directly, it is suggested to 
purchase the carpet tile material from Interface Americas, Inc. The total price for this 
product purchased directly from the manufacturer should not exceed $38,618.91. 
The project price in total should not exceed $101,745.73.
