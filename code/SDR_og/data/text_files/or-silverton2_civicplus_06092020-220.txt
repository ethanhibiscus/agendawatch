F. The variance request is the minimum variance that would alleviate the hardship.  
9 of 12 
II.  FINDINGS 
 
A. Background Information:   
 
1. The applicant submitted an application on March 25, 2020.  The property owner intends 
to convert an existing accessory structure to an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) with a 
variance to the rear yard setback to allow a 14’ setback for an ADU where 20’ is the 
minimum for an ADU at 507 Norway Street. 
 
2. Notice of the public hearing was mailed to all property owners and residents within 
700’ of the site on May 20, 2020.  The site was posted on May 29, 2020. 
 
3. The site consists of 8,885 square feet and is zoned R-1, Single Family Residential and 
measures approximately 68’ wide and 131’ deep.  The site is developed with a single 
family home and two accessory structures.  
 
B. Silverton Development Code: 
 
Variance – Review criteria:  The city shall approve an application for a variance if the review 
body finds that the applicant has shown that all of the following criteria have been met: 
 
A. The proposed variance will not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this 
code, to any other applicable policies and standards, and to other properties in the 
same zoning district or in the vicinity; 
 
Findings:  507 Norway Street is an interior lot on the western side of Norway Street.  The 
dwelling was constructed in 1919.   
 
The proposed variance is to allow a 14’ rear yard (west) setback for an accessory dwelling 
unit (ADU).  The property owner is proposing to convert an existing accessory structure 
into an ADU.  Accessory structures have a 5’ side and rear yard setback.  The current 
structure is compliant with the 5’ rear yard setback and was approved to be located 2’ from 
the northerly property line as part of the partition that created 509 Norway Street, the lot 
the west.  ADU’s require a 20’ rear yard setback, therefore the existing structure could not 
be converted to an ADU as it would not meet setbacks.  The applicant is requesting a 
variance to the rear yard ADU setback to allow a 14’ setback.   
 
The purpose of residential setback yards is to provide space for private yards and building 
separation for fire protection/security, building maintenance, sunlight and air circulation.  
The applicant submitted testimony from surrounding neighbors, including the owner of 509 
Norway Street, the property directly to the west which would be most impacted by the 
ADU, as being in support of the ADU.   
 
The dwelling at 509 Norway Street is setback about 45’ from the impacted property line 
which creates a 59’ foot separation from the existing dwelling and proposed ADU.  Typical 
setbacks would create a minimum separation of a dwelling to the ADU of 35’.  The 
proposed variance, given the existing dwelling location still maintains in excess of the 
minimum separation per code.   
10 of 12 
 
Given a purpose of residential setbacks is to provide space for private yards and the 
neighboring properties do not object to the variance and the existing separation is larger 
than the minimum required by code, the requested variance is not materially detrimental to 
the purpose of the code. 
 
The applicant shall obtain all necessary building permits and pay all applicable fees 
(Condition 1). 
 
B. A hardship to development exists that is peculiar to the lot size or shape, 
topography, wetlands, floodplains, or other similar circumstances related to the 
property over which the applicant has no control, and that are not applicable to 
other properties in the vicinity; 
 
Findings:  The dwelling was constructed in 1919, the accessory structure in 1981 and the 
applicant purchased the dwelling in 2019.  The lots shape and size was created as a 
partition in 1996 when 509 Norway Street was created.  The impacted property line 
between 507 and 509 Norway Street could have been located 6’ to the west as in that 
location both lots would meet dimensional and area standards, which would have allowed 
the accessory structure to be converted to an ADU without necessitating a variance.  .    
 
C. The use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title and city standards 
will be maintained to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while 
permitting reasonable economic use of the land; 
 
Findings:  The use proposed is permitted and is reasonable given the minimum separation 
between the adjacent dwelling and proposed ADU will be met.   
 
D. Existing physical and natural systems, such as but not limited to traffic, drainage, 
natural resources, and parks will not be adversely affected any more than would 
occur if the development occurred as specified by the subject code standard; 
 
Findings:  The reduction of the yard setbacks will not adversely affect the existing 
physical and natural systems of the area.   Traffic impacts will not be affected due to the 
structure being closer to the rear property line than prescribed by code.   
 
E. The hardship is not self-imposed; and 
 
Findings:  The applicant purchased the property in 2019 and had no control of the 
construction of the house or accessory structure in 2012 and 1981, respectively. 
 
F.  The variance request is the minimum variance that would alleviate the hardship. 
 
Findings:  The variance is the minimum necessary as the structure and property line 
location already exist.  
 
III.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
 
11 of 12 
The required findings have been made for all of the applicable Code sections.  The 
proposal as conditioned meets all applicable Silverton Development Code Review Criteria 
and Standards.  Staff recommends the Planning Commission approve the request to allow a 
14’ rear yard (west) setback for an Accessory Dwelling Unit.

ATTACHMENT B:  STAFF REPORT, CP-20-01 
 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
 
A. Background Information:   
 
1. In May 2019, the City engaged ECONorthwest to develop a housing needs analysis and 
housing strategy to document these housing issues (among others) and work with the 
community to develop policy approaches to help solve these issues. 
 
2. The passage of House Bill 2003 in 2019 established a requirement for the Oregon Land 
Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) to set a schedule (by December 31, 
2019) for all Oregon cities with a population of more than 10,000 to adopt updated housing 
needs analyses (HNAs).  The City is on schedule with the current HNA, after which it will 
have to be updated every 8 years. 
 
3. Throughout this project, ECONorthwest met with the Housing Affordability Task Force 
five times to discuss the findings and results of the HNA and to develop policy responses to 
address housing affordability and other unmet housing needs in Silverton. In December 
2019, the City hosted an open house to discuss the results of the HNA and solicit opinions 
about the policy solutions proposed in the Silverton Housing Strategy. The open house was 
attended by more than 40 residents of Silverton as well as other interested stakeholders. 
The response to the policy proposals was, on the whole, positive. 
 
4. The HNA is a technical document intended to identify issues with residential land use and 
unmet housing needs. The HNA addresses the requirement of Oregon’s Statewide Planning 
Goal 10 and OAR 660-008. The methods used for this study generally follow the Planning 
for Residential Growth guidebook, published by the Oregon Transportation and Growth 
Management Program (1996). 
 
CP-20-01 
4 of 8 
B. Review Criteria: 
 
1.  A legislative amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive 
Plan, the state-wide planning goals, and any relevant area plans adopted by the City 
Council. 
 
Findings of Fact: 
 
 
The HNA is a technical document intended to identify issues with residential land use and 
unmet housing needs. The HNA addresses the requirement of Oregon’s Statewide Planning 
Goal 10 and OAR 660-008. The methods used for the study generally follow the Planning 
for Residential Growth guidebook, published by the Oregon Transportation and Growth 
Management Program (1996). 
 
The goal of the Urbanization element is to “Provide adequate land to meet anticipated 
future demands for urban development in a logical and orderly manner.”  Conducting a 
HNA allows the City to develop policies on where and how housing of different types is to 
be provided, thereby ensuring development occurs in a logical and orderly manner. 
 
The goal of the Citizen Involvement element of the Comprehensive Plan is to “Insure that 
the citizens of Silverton and those residents in the planning area have an opportunity to be 
involved with all phases of the planning process.”  Throughout this project, ECONorthwest 
met with the Housing Affordability Task Force five times to discuss the findings and 
results of the HNA and to develop policy responses to address housing affordability and 
other unmet housing needs in Silverton. In December 2019, the City hosted an open house 
to discuss the results of the HNA and solicit opinions about the policy solutions proposed 
in the Silverton Housing Strategy. The open house was attended by more than 40 residents 
of Silverton as well as other interested stakeholders. The response to the policy proposals 
was, on the whole, positive.  The HNA will be presented before the Planning Commission 
and City Council in Public Hearings. 
 
The goal of the Housing element is to “Meet the projected housing needs of citizens in the 
Silverton area.”  The primary goals of the housing needs analysis were to (1) project the 
amount of land needed to accommodate the future housing needs of all types within 
Silverton, (2) evaluate the existing residential land supply within Silverton to determine if 
it is adequate to meet that need, (3) fulfil state planning requirements for a twenty-year 
supply of residential land, and (4) identify policy and programmatic options for the City to 
meet its identified housing needs. 
 
2.  A legislative amendment is needed to meet changing conditions or new laws. 
 
Findings of Fact: 
 
The City of Silverton recognizes that affordability is increasingly becoming a barrier to 
people staying in and moving to Silverton. Long-time residents have been unable to 
purchase housing in Silverton, and some are being priced out of the rental market. The 
Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force started meeting in January 2019 to discuss 
housing affordability issues and policy solutions to begin to address these issues. Before 
CP-20-01 
5 of 8 
the Housing Needs Analysis started, the Task Force discussed key data about housing 
affordability to better understand the dimensions of affordability problems for homeowners 
and renters in Silverton and people being priced out of the housing market. They discussed 
potential solutions to these issues, such as changes in the City’s Development Code, 
policies to support the development of income-restricted affordable housing, and policies to 
support the development of market-rate affordable housing. 
 
While Silverton’s rental prices are comparable to other communities in the region, home 
sales prices remain slightly higher than regional averages. Between January 2015 and April 
2019, median housing sales prices increased by $116,000 (57% change). Between 2000 and 
2017, median household income (inflation-adjusted) increased by about $2,000 (3% 
change). Given these factors, Silverton will continue to have demand for affordable, lower-
income and middle-income housing. 
 
About 80% of Silverton’s housing stock is single-family detached, compared to 72% for 
Marion County as a whole. As of 2017, a majority of Silverton’s households (69%) were 
homeowners. Nearly all homeowners (98%) and 43% of renters live in single-family 
detached housing. 
 
The key demographic trends that will affect Silverton’s future housing needs are the aging 
of Baby Boomers and the aging of Millennials (and younger generations). As Baby 
Boomers age, growth of retirees will drive demand for housing types specific to seniors, 
such as small and easy-to-maintain dwellings, assisted-living facilities, or age-restricted 
developments. Silverton’s ability to retain Millennials and other younger residents will 
depend on whether the city has opportunities for housing that both appeals to and is 
affordable to younger households. 
 
Silverton’s key challenge over the next 20 years is providing opportunities for the 
development of relatively affordable housing of all types, from lower-cost single-family 
housing to market-rate multifamily rental housing.  
 
o About 26% of Silverton’s households had incomes less than $34,700 and cannot 
afford a two-bedroom apartment at Marion County’s 2020 Fair Market Rent (FMR) 
of $1,001 without cost burdening themselves.  
o In 2020, a household will need to earn $19.25 an hour (or $40,000 per year) to 
afford a two-bedroom rental unit at Marion County’s Fair Market Rent. About 34% 
of Silverton’s existing households have incomes below this amount. 
o Silverton currently has a deficit of approximately 182 housing units that are 
affordable to households earning less than $35,000.  
o About 30% of Silverton’s households are cost burdened (paying more than 30% of 
their gross income on housing costs), with 46% of renters and 23% of owners 
paying more than 30% of their income on housing.

3.  The result of the legislative amendment will result in an improvement to the Comprehensive 
Plan that furthers the adopted goals, policies or needs of the community above the current 
Comprehensive Plan.  
 
Findings of Fact: 
 
The existing Housing section of the Comprehensive Plan has not been updated since the 
year 2000.  
 
A 20-year population forecast (in this instance, 2020 to 2040) is the foundation for 
estimating the number of new dwelling units needed.  The forecast of population for 
Silverton for the 2020-2040 period per Metro 2040 Population Distribution Forecast 2016 
is estimated to increase from 10,701 to 13,759, an increase of 3,058 people representing a 
29% increase with a 1.26% annual growth rate. 
 
To accommodate the city’s forecasted population growth of 3,058 new residents, Silverton 
will need to plan for 1,158 new dwelling units between 2020 and 2040, at an annual 
average of about 58 new dwelling units per year. About 753 dwelling units are anticipated 
to be single-family detached housing types (65%); 81 dwelling units will be single-family 
attached housing types (7%); 151 dwelling units will be duplexes, triplexes, and 
quadplexes (13%); and 174 dwelling units will be multifamily housing types of five or 
more units (15%).  
 
This housing mix represents a shift from the existing mix of housing, in which about 80% 
of Silverton’s housing stock in the 2013–2017 period was single-family detached housing. 
The shift in mix is in response to the need for a wider variety of housing types with a 
broader range of price points than are currently available in Silverton’s housing stock. 
 
Silverton’s 654 acres of buildable land has the capacity to accommodate 2,320 new 
dwelling units. While Silverton’s forecast for demand is for 1,158 new dwelling units, 
Silverton has a deficit of capacity for 304 dwelling units in the Multifamily plan 
designation (over the 2020 to 2040 period). 
 
Silverton has a deficit of land for 304 dwelling units in the Multifamily plan designation 
(about 17 gross acres). Currently, Silverton’s available land in its Multifamily plan 
designation is zoned at densities consistent with the Single-Family plan designation which 
cannot accommodate most multifamily housing types. Addressing this deficit is key to 
meeting Silverton’s housing needs over the 20-year period.  
 
The City cannot adopt the housing needs analysis until it identifies how it will meet this 17 
gross acre deficit of land in the Multifamily Plan Designation. ORS 197.296 requires that 
the City must adopt “measures” (i.e., policies) “…necessary to accommodate the estimated 
housing needs.” This means that the City must adopt policies, such as rezoning land, to 
meet the deficit of 17 gross acres of land in the RM-10 and RM-20 zones. The could adopt 
other policies to that will help reduce or meet the deficit of land, such as planning for more 
multifamily mixed-use buildings in downtown or increasing residential density allowed in 
the RM-10 and RM-20 zones. 
 
CP-20-01 
7 of 8 
One policy the City can adopt to meet the deficit of land multifamily units is to look at 
rezoning the properties that are designated Multifamily of the Comprehensive Plan that are 
currently zoned R-1 to a Multifamily zone, such as RM-10.  There are two areas of 
unconstrained, vacant land that meet this definition.  One is located on the south side of 
Pine Street between April Lane and Grant Street that is 6 acres in size.  The other is at the 
intersection of Brown Street and Pine Street that comprises 1.5 acres.  This would account 
for 7.5 of the identified 17 acres or up to 150 of the identified 304 dwelling units.   
 
Another policy to consider is to develop a more defined plan for potential multi-family 
housing on the city-owned Westfield property.  There are about 8 acres of land that could 
be used for housing on the site.  One of the Council goals is to explore the potential of 
using the Westfield site to develop affordable housing.  This policy would bring the total 
land to 15.5 acres of the identified 17 acres or up to 230 of the identified 304 dwelling 
units. 
 
The HNA is also recommending policies to allow multi-family housing in the R-1 zone 
subject to clear and objective standards.  The housing types under consideration would be 
for cottage clusters, which are small dwellings located on a single lot; tri-plexes, which 
comprise three dwellings in one building; four-plexes, which comprise four dwellings 
within one building; and courtyard apartments, which may comprise up to 10 units in a 
building.  .  The City applied for technical assistance from the State to implement HB 2001 
to develop the code language to implement the policy and to define what the development 
would look like.  Over the 20 year period staff finds it reasonable to estimate that 5 cottage 
clusters, 5 tri-plexes, 5 four-plexes, and one courtyard apartment will be developed in the 
R-1 zone, accounting for 65 units.  This policy would bring the total units to 295 of the 
identified 304 dwelling units.  
 
The HNA recommends developing criteria and a process for identifying land to up-zone (or 
rezone) to meet the deficit of land for multifamily development. The criteria could include 
considerations of location, transportation access, access to and capacity of infrastructure, 
site size and development constraints, and other relevant criteria. The City could work with 
landowners of these sites to identify those who are interested in developing their land with 
multifamily housing and are interested in the change in zoning and incentives to changing 
the zone could be developed to facilitate the process, such as waiving the zone change fee.  
The intent would be to find smaller infill parcels that have characteristics that make 
multifamily housing development appropriate for the area.  The idea would be to find 
similar parcels such as the old church building on N 2nd Street across from Roth’s that 
recently went through the zone change process to develop the building into apartments.  It 
is estimated that there are about 5 acres that could be expected to be up-zoned with 
properties in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 acres.  This policy would bring the total land to 20.5 
acres of the 17 identified and the total units to 345 of the identified 304 units.   
 
 
 
C. Recommendation: 
 
City Staff recommends the Planning Commission review the Housing Needs Analysis at a 
public hearing and prepare a recommendation to the City Council to approve the 
CP-20-01 
8 of 8 
Comprehensive Plan amendment, or approve the Comprehensive Plan amendment with 
modifications, including the four policies needed to address the estimated housing need.  
 
The Planning Commission is required to hold the Public Hearing portion of the HNA 
adoption process in 2020 since it is a 2020-2040 document.  The Planning Commission 
does not need to forward on a recommendation in 2020 so there is time for the Planning 
Commission to work through the document if they find it necessary to recommend 
modifications.

Silverton Housing Needs Analysis

Executive Summary 
The City of Silverton recognizes that affordability is increasingly becoming a barrier to people 
staying in and moving to Silverton. Long-time residents have been unable to purchase housing 
in Silverton, and some are being priced out of the rental market. The Silverton Affordable 
Housing Task Force started meeting in January 2019 to discuss housing affordability issues and 
policy solutions to begin to address these issues. Before the Housing Needs Analysis started, the 
Task Force discussed key data about housing affordability to better understand the dimensions 
of affordability problems for homeowners and renters in Silverton and people being priced out 
of the housing market. They discussed potential solutions to these issues, such as changes in the 
City’s Development Code, policies to support the development of income-restricted affordable 
housing, and policies to support the development of market-rate affordable housing. 
In May 2019, the City engaged ECONorthwest to develop a housing needs analysis and housing 
strategy to document these housing issues (among others) and work with the community to 
develop policy approaches to help solve these issues. This report presents the Housing Needs 
Analysis (HNA). The memorandum Silverton Housing Strategy presents recommendations for 
policies and actions to address the housing needs identified in this report. 
Throughout this project, ECONorthwest met with the Housing Affordability Task Force five 
times to discuss the findings and results of the HNA and to develop policy responses to address 
housing affordability and other unmet housing needs in Silverton. In December 2019, the City 
hosted an open house to discuss the results of the HNA and solicit opinions about the policy 
solutions proposed in the Silverton Housing Strategy. The open house was attended by more than 
40 residents of Silverton as well as other interested stakeholders. The response to the policy 
proposals was, on the whole, positive. 
The HNA is a technical document intended to identify issues with residential land use and 
unmet housing needs. The HNA addresses the requirement of Oregon’s Statewide Planning 
Goal 10 and OAR 660-008. The methods used for this study generally follow the Planning for 
Residential Growth guidebook, published by the Oregon Transportation and Growth 
Management Program (1996). 
The primary goals of the housing needs analysis were to (1) project the amount of land needed 
to accommodate the future housing needs of all types within Silverton, (2) evaluate the existing 
residential land supply within Silverton to determine if it is adequate to meet that need, (3) 
fulfill state planning requirements for a twenty-year supply of residential land, and (4) identify 
policy and programmatic options for the City to meet its identified housing needs.

Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
viii 
What are the key housing needs in Silverton? 
Following are several key issues identified in the housing needs analysis: 
 
Silverton’s existing housing stock is mostly single-family detached housing. About 
80% of Silverton’s housing stock is single-family detached, compared to 72% for Marion 
County as a whole. As of 2017, a majority of Silverton’s households (69%) were 
homeowners. Nearly all homeowners (98%) and 43% of renters live in single-family 
detached housing. 
 
Household incomes in Silverton are higher than household incomes in Marion 
County, but changes in income have not kept pace with growth in housing prices. 
While Silverton’s rental prices are comparable to other communities in the region, home 
sales prices remain slightly higher than regional averages. Between January 2015 and 
April 2019, median housing sales prices increased by $116,000 (57% change). Between 
2000 and 2017, median household income (inflation-adjusted) increased by about $2,000 
(3% change). Given these factors, Silverton will continue to have demand for affordable, 
lower-income and middle-income housing. 
 
Demographic and economic trends will drive demand for relatively affordable 
housing in Silverton. The key demographic trends that will affect Silverton’s future 
housing needs are the aging of Baby Boomers and the aging of Millennials (and younger 
generations). As Baby Boomers age, growth of retirees will drive demand for housing 
types specific to seniors, such as small and easy-to-maintain dwellings, assisted-living 
facilities, or age-restricted developments. Silverton’s ability to retain Millennials and 
other younger residents will depend on whether the city has opportunities for housing 
that both appeals to and is affordable to younger households. 
 
Silverton has an existing lack of affordable housing. Silverton’s key challenge over the 
next 20 years is providing opportunities for the development of relatively affordable 
housing of all types, from lower-cost single-family housing to market-rate multifamily 
rental housing.  
o About 26% of Silverton’s households had incomes less than $34,700 and cannot 
afford a two-bedroom apartment at Marion County’s 2020 Fair Market Rent (FMR) 
of $1,001 without cost burdening themselves.  
o In 2020, a household will need to earn $19.25 an hour (or $40,000 per year) to afford a 
two-bedroom rental unit at Marion County’s Fair Market Rent. About 34% of 
Silverton’s existing households have incomes below this amount. 
o Silverton currently has a deficit of approximately 182 housing units that are 
affordable to households earning less than $35,000.  
o About 30% of Silverton’s households are cost burdened (paying more than 30% of 
their gross income on housing costs), with 46% of renters and 23% of owners paying 
more than 30% of their income on housing.

How much population growth is Silverton planning for? 
A 20-year population forecast (in this instance, 2020 to 2040) is the foundation for estimating the 
number of new dwelling units needed. Exhibit 1 shows a population forecast for Silverton for 
the 2020 to 2040 period. It shows that Silverton’s population will grow by about 3,058 
households over the 20-year period.

How much housing will Silverton need? 
To accommodate the city’s forecasted population growth of 3,058 new residents, Silverton will 
need to plan for 1,158 new dwelling units between 2020 and 2040, at an annual average of about 
58 new dwelling units per year. About 753 dwelling units will be single-family detached 
housing types (65%); 81 dwelling units will be single-family attached housing types (7%); 151 
dwelling units will be duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes (13%); and 174 dwelling units will be 
multifamily housing types of five or more units (15%).  
This housing mix represents a shift from the existing mix of housing, in which about 80% of 
Silverton’s housing stock in the 2013–2017 period was single-family detached housing. The shift 
in mix is in response to the need for a wider variety of housing types with a broader range of 
price points than are currently available in Silverton’s housing stock.  
How much buildable residential land does Silverton  
currently have? 
Exhibit 2 shows buildable residential acres by plan designation, after excluding constrained and 
unbuildable land. The results show that Silverton has about 654 net buildable acres in 
residential plan designations.

How much land will be required for housing?  
Exhibit 3 shows that Silverton’s 654 acres of buildable land has the capacity to accommodate 
2,320 new dwelling units. While Silverton’s forecast for demand is for 1,158 new dwelling units, 
Silverton has a deficit of capacity for 304 dwelling units in the Multifamily plan designation 
(over the 2020 to 2040 period). The following summarizes Silverton’s land sufficiency results by 
plan designation:  
 
Single-Family: Silverton has a surplus of capacity for about 1,409 dwelling units, or 381 
gross acres of land to accommodate growth. 
 
Multifamily: Silverton has a deficit of capacity for about 304 dwelling units, or 17 gross 
acres of land to accommodate growth. 
 
Ag/Urban Reserve: Silverton has a surplus of capacity for about 32 dwelling units, or 12 
gross acres of land to accommodate growth.

Silverton Housing Needs Analysis

What are the key findings of the Housing Needs Analysis? 
The key findings of the Silverton’s Housing Needs Analysis are that:  
 
Silverton is planning for continued growth in single-family detached housing but 
more growth in single-family attached and multifamily dwelling units to meet the 
City’s housing needs. The factors driving the shift in types of housing needed in 
Silverton include changes in demographics and decreases in housing affordability. The 
aging of Baby Boomers and the household formation of Millennials will drive demand 
for renter and owner-occupied housing, such as single-family detached housing, 
townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, and apartments. Both groups may prefer 
housing in walkable neighborhoods, with access to services.  
o Silverton has an existing deficit of housing affordable for low-income households, 
which indicates a need for a wider range of housing types for renters and 
homeowners. About 30% of Silverton’s households are cost burdened (paying more 
than 30% of their income on housing), including a cost-burden rate of 46% for renter 
households. 
o Diversification of housing types can help reduce the lack of affordable housing, 
especially for middle-income households. About 442 new households will have 
incomes between $34,700 and $83,280. These households will all need access to 
affordable housing, such as the housing types described above. 
o Lack of low-income affordable housing is an issue and will require policy solutions 
that support the production of income-restricted low-income housing, as discussed 
in the Housing Strategy. Under the current conditions, 306 of the forecasted new 
households will have incomes at or below $34,700 (in 2018 dollars). These 
households often cannot afford market-rate housing without government subsidy. 
 
Silverton has a small deficit of land for multifamily housing. Silverton has a deficit of 
land for 304 dwelling units in the Multifamily plan designation (about 17 gross acres). 
Currently, Silverton’s available land in its Multifamily plan designation is zoned at 
densities consistent with the Single-Family plan designation which cannot accommodate 
most multifamily housing types. Addressing this deficit is key to meeting Silverton’s 
housing needs over the 20-year period.  
The City cannot adopt the housing needs analysis until it identifies how it will meet this 
17 gross acre deficit of land in the Multifamily Plan Designation. ORS 197.2961 requires 
that the City must adopt “measures” (i.e., policies) “…necessary to accommodate the 
estimated housing needs.” This means that the City must adopt policies, such as 
rezoning land, to meet the deficit of 17 gross acres of land in the RM-10 and RM-20 
zones. The could adopt other policies to that will help reduce or meet the deficit of land, 
such as planning for more multifamily mixed-use buildings in downtown or increasing 
residential density allowed in the RM-10 and RM-20 zones.

 
Silverton will need to meet the requirements of House Bill 2001. The bill requires cities 
with a population of 10,000 to 25,000 (which includes Silverton) to “allow the 
development of a duplex on each lot or parcel zoned for residential use that allows for 
the development of detached single-family dwellings.” To comply with House Bill 2001, 
Silverton will need to allow duplexes on all lots where single-family detached houses 
are allowed. That will require allowing duplexes in the AR zone and changing the 
zoning standards in the City’s residential zones so that standards for duplexes match 
standards for single-family detached housing.

Silverton Housing Needs Analysis

1. Introduction 
This report presents Silverton’s Housing Needs Analysis for the 2020 to 2040 period. It is 
intended to comply with statewide planning policies that govern planning for housing and 
residential development, including Goal 10 (Housing) and OAR 660 Division 8. The methods 
used for this study generally follow the Planning for Residential Growth guidebook, published by 
the Oregon Transportation and Growth Management Program (1996). 
The City of Silverton last completed periodic review in 2000. Silverton has changed 
considerably since then. Silverton grew from 7,414 people in 2000 to 10,325 people in 2018. This 
is an addition of 2,911 people or 39% growth. Since 2000, 1,152 units have been permitted in 
Silverton, 85% of which were single-family detached housing. In this same time, median gross 
rents increased by $333 per month, from $569 to $902.  
In more recent years, median housing prices in Silverton increased from about $250,000 in 2016 
to $429,000 in 2019, a 72% increase. The ratio of household income to homeowner housing costs 
increased from 3.76 in 2000 to 4.08 in the 2013–2017 period. Overall, rates of household cost 
burden stayed about the same (31% in 2000 to 30% in 2013–2017), however rates of cost burden 
for renter households increased (from 40% in 2000 to 46% in 2013–2017).  
In 2018, Silverton’s City Council adopted a goal to develop and implement strategies to support 
the development of affordable housing. As part of that goal, the Council created the Silverton 
Affordable Housing Task Force, which first met in January 2019. Before the Housing Needs 
Analysis started, the Task Force discussed key data about housing affordability, to better 
understand the dimensions of affordability problems for owners and renters of housing in 
Silverton, and people being priced out of the housing market. The Task Force discussed 
potential solutions to these issues, such as changes in the City’s Development Code, policies to 
support development of income-restricted affordable housing, and policies to support 
development of market-rate affordable housing. 
In May 2019, the City contracted with ECONorthwest to develop a housing needs analysis (this 
document) and a housing strategy to address unmet housing needs through working with the 
Affordable Housing Task Force.  
This report provides Silverton with a factual basis to update the Housing Element of the City’s 
Comprehensive Plan and zoning code, and to support future planning efforts related to housing 
and options for addressing unmet housing needs in Silverton. This report provides information 
that informs future planning efforts, including development and redevelopment. This report 
provides the City with information about the housing market in Silverton and describes the 
factors that will affect future housing demand in Silverton, such as changing demographics. 
This analysis will help decision makers understand whether Silverton has enough land to 
accommodate growth over the next 20 years.

Framework for a Housing Needs Analysis 
Economists view housing as a bundle of services for which people are willing to pay, including 
shelter, proximity to other attractions (jobs, shopping, recreation), amenities (type and quality of 
fixtures and appliances, landscaping, views), prestige, and access to public services (quality of 
schools). Because it is impossible to maximize all these services and simultaneously minimize 
costs, households must make trade-offs. What they can get for their money is influenced both 
by economic forces and government policy. Moreover, different households will have different 
values and preferences, which in turn are a function of many factors like income, age of 
household head, number of people and children in the household, number of workers and job 
locations, number of automobiles, and so on. 
Thus, housing choices of individual households are influenced in complex ways by dozens of 
factors, and the housing markets in Marion County and Silverton are the result of the individual 
decisions of thousands of households. These points help to underscore the complexity of 
projecting what types of housing will be built in Silverton between 2020 and 2040. 
The complex nature of the housing market, demonstrated by the unprecedented boom-and-bust 
during the past decade, does not eliminate the need for some type of forecast of future housing 
demand and need. This includes resulting implications for land demand and consumption. 
Such forecasts are inherently uncertain. Their usefulness for public policy often derives more 
from the explanation of their underlying assumptions about the dynamics of markets and 
policies than from the specific estimates of future demand and need. Thus, we start our housing 
analysis with a framework for thinking about housing and residential markets and how public 
policy affects these markets.  
Statewide Planning Goal 10 
The passage of the Oregon Land Use Planning Act of 1974 (ORS Chapter 197) established the 
Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) and the Department of Land 
Conservation and Development (DLCD). The Act required the Commission to develop and 
adopt a set of statewide planning goals. Goal 10 addresses housing in Oregon and provides 
guidelines for local governments to follow in developing their local comprehensive land use 
plans and implementing policies.  
At a minimum, local housing policies must meet the requirements of Goal 10 and the statutes 
and administrative rules that implement it (ORS 197.295 to 197.314, ORS 197.475 to 197.490, and 
OAR 600-008).2 Goal 10 requires incorporated cities to complete an inventory of buildable 
residential lands. Goal 10 also requires cities to encourage the numbers of housing units in price 
and rent ranges commensurate with the financial capabilities of its households.  
                                                     
 
2 ORS 197.296 only applies to cities with populations over 25,000, which does not include Silverton, based on PSU’s 
estimate of 10,325 people within the Silverton UGB in 2018.

Goal 10 defines needed housing types as “all housing on land zoned for residential use or 
mixed residential and commercial use that is determined to meet the need shown for housing 
within an urban growth boundary at price ranges and rent levels that are affordable to 
households within the county with a variety of incomes, including but not limited to 
households with low incomes, very low incomes and extremely low incomes.” ORS 197.303 
defines needed housing types: 
(a) Housing that includes, but is not limited to, attached and detached single-family housing 
and multifamily housing for both owner and renter occupancy. 
(b) Government-assisted housing.3 
(c) Mobile home or manufactured dwelling parks, as provided in ORS 197.475 to 197.490. 
(d) Manufactured homes on individual lots planned and zoned for single-family residential 
use that are in addition to lots within designated manufactured dwelling subdivisions. 
(e) Housing for farmworkers. 
DLCD provides guidance on conducting a housing needs analysis in the document Planning for 
Residential Growth: A Workbook for Oregon’s Urban Areas.  
Silverton must identify needs for all of the housing types listed above as well as adopt policies 
that increase the likelihood that needed housing types will be developed. This Housing Needs 
Analysis was developed to meet the requirements of Goal 10 and its implementing 
administrative rules and statutes.

Public Process 
At the broadest level, the purpose of the project was to understand how much Silverton will 
grow over the next 20 years and to define and understand Silverton’s housing needs. The 
project can be broken into two components (1) technical analysis, and (2) housing strategies. 
Both benefit from public input. The technical analysis required a broad range of assumptions 
that influence the outcomes; the housing strategy is a series of high-level policy choices that will 
affect Silverton residents. 
The intent of the public process was to establish broad public engagement throughout the 
project as work occurs. Public engagement was accomplished through various avenues. We 
discuss the two primary avenues below. 
Engagement with the Affordable Housing Task Force 
The City of Silverton and ECONorthwest met with and solicited input from the Affordable 
Housing Task Force to better understand the results of the HNA and to provide input about 
policies to address the housing needs identified in the HNA. The Task Force met five times4 to 
discuss project assumptions, results, and implications. The project relied on the Task Force to 
review draft products and provide input at key points (e.g., before recommendations and 
decisions were made and before draft work products were finalized). The recommendations in 
the Silverton Housing Strategy were shaped by the Task Force and strongly reflect their input into 
policy development.  
The project required many assumptions and policy choices that the committee needed to vet 
and agree upon, as these choices affect current and future residents. In short, local review and 
community input were essential to developing a locally appropriate and politically viable 
housing needs analysis and housing strategy.  
Public Engagement 
The City of Silverton and ECONorthwest solicited input from the general public at one meeting 
held on December 3, 2019. At this meeting, ECONorthwest presented the key findings of the 
draft Housing Needs Analysis and discussed housing policies in the draft Housing Strategy, an 
action-oriented document to address Silverton’s housing needs. The open house was attended 
by more than 40 residents of Silverton as well as other interested stakeholders. Those who 
attended the public meeting had an opportunity to participate in two separate engagement 
activities to provide input on the actions in the draft Housing Strategy. ECONorthwest 
presented the results of the public meeting to the Affordable Housing Task Force to refine the 
Housing Strategy at their final meeting.

2. Residential Buildable Lands Inventory 
The general structure of the standard method BLI analysis is based on the DLCD HB 2709 
workbook “Planning for Residential Growth: A Workbook for Oregon’s Urban Areas,” which 
specifically addresses residential lands. The steps and sub-steps in the supply inventory are: 
1. Calculate the gross vacant acres by plan designation, including fully vacant and partially 
vacant parcels. 
2. Calculate gross buildable vacant acres by plan designation by subtracting unbuildable 
acres from total acres. 
3. Calculate net buildable acres by plan designation, subtracting land for future public 
facilities from gross buildable vacant acres. 
4. Calculate total net buildable acres by plan designation by adding redevelopable acres to 
net buildable acres.  
The methods used for this study are consistent with many others completed by ECONorthwest 
that have been acknowledged by DLCD and LCDC. A detailed discussion of the methodology 
used in this study is provided in Appendix A. The BLI for Silverton includes all residential land 
designated in the Comprehensive Plan within the Silverton Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). 
From a practical perspective, this means that all lands within tax lots identified by the Marion 
County Assessor’s Office that fall within the UGB were inventoried. ECONorthwest used the 
most recent tax lot shapefile from Marion County for the analysis. The inventory then builds 
from the tax lot–level database to formulate estimates of buildable land by plan designation.

Residential Buildable Land Inventory Results  
Land Base 
As defined above, the land base for the Silverton residential BLI includes all tax lots in the UGB 
in residential plan designations or plan designations with zones that allow housing outright. 
Exhibit 4 shows the land base by plan designation in the UGB. Exhibit 4 shows that Silverton 
has 3,748 tax lots in its residential land base, accounting for 1,665 acres.

Development Status 
Exhibit 5 shows total acres in tax lots classified by development status. We used a rule-based 
classification (defined in the methods and definitions section of Appendix A) to define an initial 
development status. Then, we used a rapid visual assessment method to confirm this 
development status using aerial imagery.

The buildable lands inventory identifies regulated wetlands, riparian corridors, floodways and 
floodplains, and slopes greater than 25% as constraints that prohibit development. Vacant or 
partially vacant land with these constraints are considered unavailable for development and 
were removed from the inventory of buildable land. 
Exhibit 6 shows development status with constraints applied, which results in buildable acres. 
Of the 1,665 total acres in the land base, 822 are committed acres, 189 are constrained acres, and 
654 are buildable acres.

Vacant Buildable Land 
Exhibit 8 shows buildable acres (i.e., acres in tax lots after constraints are deducted) for vacant 
and partially vacant land by plan designation. Of Silverton’s 654 unconstrained, buildable 
residential acres, about 44% are in tax lots classified as vacant, and 56% are in tax lots classified 
as partially vacant. A majority of Silverton’s buildable acres are located in the Single-Family 
Residential plan designation (531 acres or 81%).

3. Historical and Recent Development 
Trends 
Analysis of historical development trends in Silverton provides insight into the functioning of 
the local housing market. The mix of housing types and densities, in particular, are key 
variables in forecasting the capacity of residential land to accommodate new housing and to 
forecast future land need. The specific steps are described in Task 2 of the DLCD Planning for 
Residential Growth: A Workbook for Oregon’s Urban Areas as:  
1. Determine the time period for which the data will be analyzed. 
2. Identify types of housing to address (all needed housing types). 
3. Evaluate permit/subdivision data to calculate the actual mix, average actual gross 
density, and average actual net density of all housing types. 
This Housing Needs Analysis examines changes in Silverton’s housing market from 2000 to 
2017, as well as residential development from 2000 to 2018. We selected this time period 
because (1) the period provides information about Silverton’s housing market before and after 
the national housing market bubble’s growth and deflation, as well as the more recent increase 
in housing costs and (2) data about Silverton’s housing market during this period is readily 
available from sources such as the Census and the City building permit database (which 
provides information for 2000 onward).6 
The Housing Needs Analysis presents information about residential development by housing 
type. There are multiple ways that housing types can be grouped. For example, they can be 
grouped by:  
1. Structure type (e.g., single-family detached, apartments, etc.). 
2. Tenure (e.g., distinguishing unit type by owner or renter units). 
3. Housing affordability (e.g., subsidized housing or units affordable at given income 
levels). 
4. Some combination of these categories. 
For the purposes of this study, we grouped housing types based on (1) whether the structure is 
stand-alone or attached to another structure and (2) the number of dwelling units in each 
                                                     
 
6 ORS 197.296(5)(a) requires cities to determine housing capacity based on “data relating to land within the urban 
growth boundary that has been collected since the last periodic review or five years, whichever is greater.” Given 
that Silverton has not been in periodic review since 2000 and the best available data about building permits goes back 
to 2000, we used the 2000 to 2018 period for analysis of building permit data.   
ECONorthwest

structure. The housing types used in this analysis are consistent with needed housing types as 
defined in ORS 197.303:7 
 Single-family detached includes single-family detached units, manufactured homes on 
lots and in mobile home parks, and accessory dwelling units. 
 Single-family attached is all structures with a common wall where each dwelling unit 
occupies a separate lot, such as row houses or townhouses. 
 Multifamily is all attached structures (e.g., duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, and 
structures with five or more units) other than single-family detached units, 
manufactured units, or single-family attached units.  
In Silverton, government-assisted housing (ORS 197.303[b]) and housing for farmworkers (ORS 
197.303[e]) can be any of the housing types listed above. Analysis within this report discusses 
housing affordability at a variety of incomes, as required in ORS 197.303. 
Data Used in This Analysis 
Throughout this analysis (including the subsequent Chapter 4), we used data from multiple 
sources, choosing data from well-recognized and reliable data sources. One of the key sources 
for housing and household data is the U.S. Census. This report primarily uses data from two 
Census sources: 
 
The Decennial Census, which is completed every ten years and is a survey of all 
households in the United States. The Decennial Census is considered the best available 
data for information such as demographics (e.g., number of people, age distribution, or 
ethnic or racial composition), household characteristics (e.g., household size and 
composition), and housing occupancy characteristics. As of 2010, the Decennial Census 
does not collect more detailed household information, such as income, housing costs, 
housing characteristics, and other important household information. Decennial Census 
data is available for 2000 and 2010.  
 
The American Community Survey (ACS), which is completed every year and is a 
sample of households in the United States. From 2013 to 2017, the ACS sampled an 
average of 3.5 million households per year, or about 3% of the households in the nation. 
The ACS collects detailed information about households, including demographics (e.g., 
number of people, age distribution, ethnic or racial composition, country of origin, 
language spoken at home, and educational attainment), household characteristics (e.g., 
household size and composition), housing characteristics (e.g., type of housing unit, year 
unit built, or number of bedrooms), housing costs (e.g., rent, mortgage, utility, and 
insurance), housing value, income, and other characteristics. 
                                                     
 
7 ORS 197.303 defines needed housing as “all housing on land zoned for residential use or mixed residential and 
commercial use that is determined to meet the need shown for housing within an urban growth boundary at price 
ranges and rent levels that are affordable to households within the county with a variety of incomes.” 
ECONorthwest

 
Silverton building permit database, which includes information on permits issued at 
the City of Silverton from 2000 to 2018. 
 
Property Radar, which provides real estate and sales data. We use this source to collect 
monthly, median housing sale price data in aggregate. 
This report uses data from the 2013–2017 ACS for Silverton. Where information is available and 
relevant, we report information from the 2000 and 2010 Decennial Census. Among other data 
points, this report includes population, income, and housing price data from the Oregon Office 
of Economic Analysis, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, the United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Property Radar. It also uses the Oregon 
Department of Housing and Community Services’ Affordable Housing Inventory and Oregon’s 
Manufactured Dwelling Park Inventory. 
The foundation of the Housing Needs Analysis is the population forecast for Silverton from the 
Oregon Population Forecast Program. The forecast is prepared by the Portland State University 
Population Research Center. 
It is worth commenting on the methods used for the American Community Survey.8 The 
American Community Survey (ACS) is a national survey that uses continuous measurement 
methods. It uses a sample of about 3.54 million households to produce annually updated 
estimates for the same small areas (census tracts and block groups) formerly surveyed via the 
Decennial Census long-form sample. It is also important to keep in mind that all ACS data are 
estimates that are subject to sample variability. This variability is referred to as “sampling 
error” and is expressed as a band or “margin of error” (MOE) around the estimate. 
This report uses Census and ACS data because, despite the inherent methodological limits, they 
represent the most thorough and accurate data available to assess housing needs. We consider 
these limitations in making interpretations of the data and have strived not to draw conclusions 
beyond the quality of the data.

Trends in Housing Mix  
This section provides an overview of changes in the mix of housing types in Silverton and 
compares Silverton to Marion County and Oregon. These trends demonstrate the types of 
housing developed in Silverton historically. Unless otherwise noted, this chapter uses data from 
the 2000 and 2010 Decennial Census and the 2013–2017 American Community Survey 5-Year 
Estimates. 
This section shows the following trends in housing mix in Silverton: 
 
Silverton’s housing stock is predominantly single-family detached housing units. 
Eighty percent of Silverton’s housing stock is single-family detached, 15% is 
multifamily, and 5% is single-family attached (e.g., townhouses).  
 
Since 2000, Silverton’s housing mix has changed. Silverton’s housing stock grew by 
about 28% (about 800 new units) between 2000 and the 2013–2017 period. In this time, 
the share of single-family detached housing increased while the share of multifamily 
housing decreased.  
 
Single-family detached housing accounted for the majority of new housing growth in 
Silverton between 2000 and 2018. Eighty five percent of new housing permitted 
between 2000 and 2018 was single-family detached housing units.  
Housing Mix 
The total number of dwelling 
units in Silverton increased 
by 28% from 2000 to 2013–
2017.  
Silverton added 803 units 
since 2000.

Building Permits 
Over the 2000 to 2018 
period, Silverton issued 
permits for 1,152 dwelling 
units, with an annual 
average of 64 permits 
issued. 
Of these 1,152 permits, 
about 85% were for single-
family detached units, 2% 
were for single-family 
attached units, and 13% 
were for multifamily units.

Trends in Housing Density 
Housing density is the density of residential structures by structure type, expressed in dwelling 
units per net or gross acre.9 The U.S. Census does not track residential development density; 
thus, this study analyzes housing density based on Silverton’s permit database for development 
between 2000 and 2018.  
Between 2000 and 2018, Silverton permitted 1,152 new dwelling units. Of the 1,152 new units, 
977 units were single-family detached (85%), 22 were single-family attached (2%), and 153 were 
multifamily (13%). During this time, housing in Silverton developed at an average net density 
of 5.2 dwelling units per net acre.  
Exhibit 15 shows average net residential density by structure type for the historical analysis 
period. Single-family detached housing developed at 4.6 dwelling units per net acre, single-
family attached housing developed at 9.3 dwelling units per net acre, and multifamily housing 
developed at 24.4 dwelling units per net acre.

9 OAR 660-024-0010(6) defines net buildable acres as “43,560 square feet of residentially designated buildable land 
after excluding future rights-of-way for streets and roads.” While the administrative rule does not include a 
definition of a gross buildable acre, using the definition above, a gross buildable acre will include areas used for 
rights-of-way for streets and roads. Areas used for rights-of-way are considered unbuildable.

Silverton’s Multifamily plan designation contains some plan designation/zone conflicts. While 
technically the Multifamily plan designation should be composed of parcels zoned as RM-10 
and RM-20, the designation also contains parcels zoned as R-1 and R-5, which belong to the 
Single-Family plan designation. To illustrate how these plan designation/zone conflicts impact 
densities, Exhibit 16 displays net densities by zone for the Multifamily plan designation.

Trends in Tenure 
Housing tenure describes whether a dwelling is occupied by a homeowner or a renter. This 
section shows: 
 
Homeownership rates in Silverton are higher than Marion County and Oregon’s 
rates. About 69% of Silverton’s households own their home. In comparison, 60% of 
Marion County households and 62% of Oregon households are homeowners. 
 
Homeownership rates in Silverton increased between 2000 and 2013–2017. In 2000, 
61% of Silverton households were homeowners. This increased to 65% in 2010 and 69% 
in 2013–2017. 
 
Nearly all Silverton homeowners (98%) live in single-family detached housing, while 
almost half of renters (44%) live in multifamily housing. 
The implications for the forecast of new housing are that (1) opportunities for rental housing in 
Silverton are limited, given that nearly half of renters live in multifamily housing and limited 
multifamily housing has been built in Silverton since 2000 (13% of new dwelling units between 
2000 and 2018 were multifamily dwellings), and (2) there may be opportunities to encourage 
development of a wider variety of affordable attached housing types for homeownership, such 
as townhomes. 
The homeownership rate in 
Silverton increased since 
2000.

Vacancy Rates 
Housing vacancy is a measure of housing that is available to prospective renters and buyers. It 
is also a measure of unutilized housing stock. The Census defines vacancy as "unoccupied 
housing units . . . determined by the terms under which the unit may be occupied, e.g., for rent, 
for sale, or for seasonal use only." The 2010 Census identified vacancy through an enumeration, 
separate from (but related to) the survey of households. Enumerators are obtained using 
information from property owners and managers, neighbors, rental agents, and others.  
According to the 2013–2017 Census, the vacancy rate in Silverton was 5.0%, compared to 6.9% 
for Marion County and 9.3% for Oregon. In 2000, the vacancy rate in Silverton was 3.9%. 
Government-Assisted Housing  
Governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations offer a range of housing assistance to low 
and moderate-income households in renting or purchasing a home. There are six government-
assisted housing developments in Silverton, with a total of 107 affordable units.

Manufactured Homes 
Manufactured homes provide a source of affordable housing in Silverton. They provide a form 
of homeownership that can be made available to low- and moderate-income households. Cities 
are required to plan for manufactured homes—both on lots and in parks (ORS 197.475-492). 
Generally, manufactured homes in parks (manufactured housing communities) are owned by 
the occupants who pay rent for the space. Monthly housing costs are typically lower for a 
homeowner in a manufactured housing community for several reasons, including the fact that 
property taxes levied on the value of the land are paid by the property owner, rather than the 
manufactured homeowner. The value of the manufactured home generally does not appreciate 
in the way a conventional home would, however. Manufactured homeowners in communities 
are also subject to the mercy of the property owner in terms of rent rates and increases. It is 
generally not within the means of a manufactured homeowner to relocate to another 
manufactured home to escape rent increases. Homeowners living in a community is desirable to 
some because it can provide more security (with on-site managers) and amenities (such as 
laundry and recreation facilities). 
Within the UGB, Silverton has two manufactured housing communities, with a total of 125 
manufactured home spaces. As of August of 2019, no spaces were vacant. 
OAR 197.480(4) requires cities to inventory the mobile home or manufactured dwelling 
communities sited in areas planned and zoned or generally used for commercial, industrial, or 
high-density residential development. Exhibit 21 presents the inventory of manufactured home 
communities within Silverton as of 2019.

4. Demographic and Other Factors Affecting 
Residential Development in Silverton 
Demographic trends are important for a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the 
Silverton housing market. Silverton exists in a regional economy; trends in the region impact 
the local housing market. This chapter documents demographic, socioeconomic, and other 
trends relevant to Silverton at the national, state, and regional levels. 
Demographic trends provide a context for growth in a region; factors such as age, income, 
migration, and other trends show how communities have grown and how they will shape 
future growth. To provide context, we compare Silverton to Marion County and Oregon. We 
also compare Silverton to nearby cities where appropriate. Characteristics such as age and 
ethnicity are indicators of how the population has grown in the past and provide insight into 
factors that may affect future growth. 
A recommended approach to conducting a housing needs analysis is described in Planning for 
Residential Growth: A Workbook for Oregon’s Urban Areas, the Department of Land Conservation 
and Development’s guidebook on local housing needs studies. As described in the workbook, 
the specific steps in the housing needs analysis are: 
1. Project the number of new housing units needed in the next 20 years. 
2. Identify relevant national, state, and local demographic and economic trends and factors 
that may affect the 20-year projection of structure type mix.  
3. Describe the demographic characteristics of the population and, if possible, the housing 
trends that relate to demand for different types of housing. 
4. Determine the types of housing that are likely to be affordable to the projected 
households based on household income. 
5. Determine the needed housing mix and density ranges for each plan designation and the 
average needed net density for all structure types.  
6. Estimate the number of additional needed units by structure type. 
This chapter presents data to address steps 2, 3, and 4 in this list. Chapter 5 presents data to 
address steps 1, 5, and 6 in this list.

Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors Affecting Housing 
Choice10 
Analysts typically describe housing demand as the preferences for different types of housing 
(e.g., single-family detached or apartment) and the ability to pay for that housing (the ability to 
exercise those preferences in a housing market by purchasing or renting housing; in other 
words, income or wealth).  
Many demographic and socioeconomic variables affect housing choice. However, the literature 
about housing markets finds that age of the householder, size of the household, and income are 
most strongly correlated with housing choice. 
 
Age of householder is the age of the person identified (in the Census) as the head of 
household. Households make different housing choices at different stages of life. This 
chapter discusses generational trends, such as housing preferences of Baby Boomers, 
people born from about 1946 to 1964, and Millennials, people born from about 1980 to 
2000. 
 
Size of household is the number of people living in the household. Younger and older 
people are more likely to live in single-person households. People in their middle years 
are more likely to live in multi-person households (often with children). 
 
Household income is probably the most important determinant of housing choice. 
Income is strongly related to the type of housing a household chooses (e.g., single-family 
detached, duplex, or a building with more than five units) and to household tenure (e.g., 
rent or own).  
This chapter focuses on these factors, presenting data that suggests how changes to these factors 
may affect housing need in Silverton over the next 20 years.

National Trends11 
This brief summary on national housing trends builds on previous work by ECONorthwest, the 
Urban Land Institute (ULI) reports, and conclusions from The State of the Nation’s Housing, 2019 
report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. The Harvard report 
summarizes the national housing outlook as follows: 
If housing costs continue to rise faster than incomes, growth of households—and 
of housing demand—is likely to slow. As it is, the market has only produced 
enough homes to match the pace of household growth, let alone cover 
replacement and second-home demand and allow normal levels of vacancies. If 
current housing supply trends persist, house prices and rents will continue to 
rise at a healthy clip, further limiting the housing options for many. To ensure 
that the market can produce homes that meet the diverse needs of the growing 
US population, the public, private, and nonprofit sectors must address 
constraints on the development process. And for the millions of families and 
individuals that struggle to find housing that fits their budgets, much greater 
public efforts will be necessary to close the gap between what they can afford 
and the cost of producing decent housing. 
However, challenges to a strong domestic housing market remain. High mortgage rates make 
housing unaffordable for many Americans, especially younger Americans. In addition to rising 
housing costs, wages have also failed to keep pace, worsening affordability pressures. Single-
family and multifamily housing supplies remain tight, which compound affordability issues. 
The State of the Nation’s Housing report emphasizes the importance of government assistance and 
intervention to keep housing affordable moving forward. Several challenges and trends shaping 
the housing market are summarized below: 
 
Moderate new construction and tight housing supply, particularly for affordable 
housing. New construction experienced its ninth year of gains in 2018 with 1.25 million 
units added to the national stock. There were about 374,000 multifamily starts in 2018, 
an increase after a two-year slump in 2015 and 2016, putting multifamily growth at its 
highest rate since 1988. The supply of sale homes in 2018 averaged 4.0 months, below 
what is considered balanced (six months) and lower-cost homes are considered 
especially scarce. The State of the Nation’s Housing report cites lack of skilled labor, higher 
land prices, and land use regulations as constraints on new construction. 
 
 
                                                     
 
11 These trends are based on information from (1) the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University’s 
publication “The State of the Nation’s Housing 2018,” (2) Urban Land Institute, “2018 Emerging Trends in Real 
Estate,” and (3) the U.S. Census.

 
Demand shift from renting to owning. After years of decline, the national 
homeownership rate increased to 64.4% in 2017–2018, up half a percentage point from 
the prior year. Trends suggest the recent homeownership increases are among 
householders of all age groups; however, homeownership rates continue to remain 
below historic levels from 30 years ago. Homeownership rates of those aged 65 and 
older have remained strong, 2.9 percentage points above 1988 levels, and 
homeownership rates among young adults have begun stabilizing after years of decline. 
 
Housing affordability. In 2017, about 31.5% of American households spent more than 
30% of their income on housing. This figure is down from the prior year and continues 
to improve relative to its 2010 peak, bolstered by a considerable drop in the owner share 
of cost-burdened households. The share of cost-burdened renter households, however, 
continue to remain above that of homeowners, and renter households now exceed the 
number of cost-burdened homeowners by more than 3 million. Low-income households 
face an especially dire hurdle to afford housing. With such a large share of households 
exceeding the traditional standards for affordability, policymakers are focusing efforts 
on the severely cost burdened. Among those earning less than $15,000, 72% of 
households paid more than half of their income on housing. 
 
Long-term growth and housing demand. The Joint Center for Housing Studies forecasts 
that, nationally, demand for new homes could total as many as 12 million units between 
2018 and 2028. Much of the demand will come from Baby Boomers, Millennials,12 and 
immigrants. The Urban Land Institute cites the trouble of overbuilding in the luxury 
sector while demand is in mid-priced single-family houses affordable to a larger buyer 
pool. 
 
Growth in rehabilitation market.13 Aging housing stock and poor housing conditions 
are growing concerns for jurisdictions across the United States. With almost 80% of the 
nation’s housing stock at least 20 years old (and 40% at least 50 years old), Americans 
are spending in excess of $400 billion per year on residential renovations and repairs. As 
housing rehabilitation becomes the go-to solution to address housing conditions, the 
home remodeling market has grown more than 50% since the recession ended—
generating 2.2% of national economic activity (in 2017). 
Despite trends suggesting growth in the rehabilitation market, rising construction 
costs and complex regulatory requirements pose barriers to rehabilitation. Lower-
income households or households on fixed-incomes may defer maintenance for 
years due to limited financial means, escalating rehabilitation costs. At a certain 
                                                     
 
12 According to the Pew Research Center, Millennials were born between the years of 1981 to 1996 (inclusive). Read

point, the cost of improvements may outweigh the value of the structure, which may 
necessitate new responses such as demolition or redevelopment. 
 
Changes in housing preference. Housing preference will be affected by changes in 
demographics; most notably, the aging of Baby Boomers, housing demand from 
Millennials, and growth of immigrants.  
o Baby Boomers. The housing market will be affected by the continued aging of Baby 
Boomers, the oldest of whom were in their seventies in 2019 and the youngest of 
whom were in their fifties in 2019. Baby Boomers’ housing choices will affect 
housing preference and homeownership. Addressing housing needs for those 
moving through their 60s, 70s, and 80s (and beyond) will require a range of housing 
opportunities. For example, “the 82-to-86-year-old cohort dominates the assisted 
living and more intensive care sector” while new or near-retirees may prefer aging in 
place or active, age-targeted communities.14 Characteristics like immigration and 
ethnicity play a role too, as “older Asians and Hispanics are more likely than whites 
or blacks to live in multigenerational households.”15 Senior households earning 
different incomes may make distinctive housing choices. For instance, low-income 
seniors may not have the financial resources to live out their years in a nursing home 
and may instead choose to downsize to smaller, more affordable units. Seniors living 
in close proximity to relatives may also choose to live in multigenerational 
households. 
Research shows that “older people in western countries prefer to live in their 
own familiar environment as long as possible,” but aging in place does not only 
mean growing old in their own homes.16 A broader definition exists, which 
explains that aging in place also means “remaining in the current community 
and living in the residence of one’s choice.”17 Therefore, some Boomers are likely 
to stay in their home as long as they are able, and some will prefer to move into 
other housing products, such as multifamily housing or age-restricted housing 
developments, before they move into to a dependent living facility or into a 
familial home. Moreover, “the aging of the U.S. population, [including] the 
continued growth in the percentage of single-person households, and the 
demand for a wider range of housing choices in communities across the country 
is fueling interest in new forms of residential development, including tiny 
houses.”18

o Millennials. Over the last several decades, young adults have increasingly been living 
in multigenerational housing—more so than older demographics.19 Despite this 
trend, as Millennials age over the next 20 years, they will be forming households and 
families. In 2018, the oldest Millennials were in their late-30s and the youngest were 
in their late teens. By 2040, Millennials will be between 40 and 60 years old. 
At the beginning of the 2007–2009 recession, Millennials only started forming 
their own households. Today, Millennials are driving much of the growth in new 
households, albeit at slower rates than previous generations. From 2012 to 2017, 
Millennials formed an average of 2.1 million net new households each year. 
Twenty-six percent of Millennials aged 25 to 34 lived with their parents (or other 
relatives) in 2017. 
Millennials’ average wealth may remain far below Boomers and Gen Xers, and 
student loan debt will continue to hinder consumer behavior and affect 
retirement savings. As of 2015, Millennials comprised 28% of active home 
buyers, while Gen Xers comprised 32% and Boomers 31%.20 That said, “over the 
next 15 years, nearly $24 trillion will be transferred in bequests,” presenting new 
opportunities for Millennials (as well as Gen Xers). 
o Immigrants. Research on foreign-born populations shows that immigrants, more than 
native-born populations, prefer to live in multigenerational housing. Still, 
immigration and increased homeownership among minorities could also play a key 
role in accelerating household growth over the next 10 years. Current Population 
Survey estimates indicate that the number of foreign-born households rose by nearly 
400,000 annually between 2001 and 2007, and they accounted for nearly 30% of 
overall household growth. Beginning in 2008, the influx of immigrants was 
staunched by the effects of the Great Recession. After a period of declines, however, 
the foreign born are again contributing to household growth. The Census Bureau’s 
estimates of net immigration in 2017–2018 indicate that 1.2 million immigrants 
moved to the United States from abroad, down from 1.3 million immigrants in 2016–
2017 but higher than the average annual pace of 850,000 during the period of 2009–
2011. However, if recent federal policies about immigration are successful, growth in 
undocumented and documented immigration could slow and cause a drag on 
household growth in the coming years. 
 
 
                                                     
 
19 According to the Pew Research Center, in 1980, just 11% of adults aged 25 to 34 lived in a multigenerational family 
household, and by 2008, 20% did (82% change). Comparatively, 17% of adults aged 65 and older lived in a 
multigenerational family household, and by 2008, 20% did (18% change).

o Diversity. The growing diversity of American households will have a large impact on 
the domestic housing markets. Over the coming decade, minorities will make up a 
larger share of young households and constitute an important source of demand for 
both rental housing and small homes. The growing gap in homeownership rates 
between whites and blacks, as well as the larger share of minority households that 
are cost burdened warrants consideration. Since 1988, the difference in 
homeownership rates between whites and blacks rose by 3.9 percentage points to 
30.1% in 2018. Alternatively, the gap between white and Latinx homeownership 
rates and white and Asian homeownership rates both decreased during this period 
but remained sizable at 26.0 and 16.0 percentage points, respectively. Although 
homeownership rates are increasing for some minorities, large shares of minority 
households are more likely to live in high-cost metro areas. This, combined with 
lower incomes than white households, leads to higher rates of cost burden for 
minority homeowners—30.2% for blacks, 29.6% for Latinx, 27.3% for Asians/others, 
and 20.4% for whites in 2017. 
 
Changes in housing characteristics. The U.S. Census Bureau’s Characteristics of New 
Housing Report (2018) presents data that show trends in the characteristics of new 
housing for the nation, state, and local areas. Several long-term trends in the 
characteristics of housing are evident from the New Housing Report:21 
o Larger single-family units on smaller lots. Between 1999 and 2018, the median size of 
new single-family dwellings increased by 18% nationally, from 2,028 sq. ft. to 2,386 
sq. ft., and 17% in the western region from 2,001 sq. ft. in 1999 to 2,341 sq. ft in 2018. 
Moreover, the percentage of new units smaller than 1,400 sq. ft. nationally decreased 
by more than half, from 15% in 1999 to 7% in 2018. The percentage of units greater 
than 3,000 sq. ft. increased from 17% in 1999 to 28% of new one-family homes 
completed in 2018. In addition to larger homes, a move toward smaller lot sizes was 
seen nationally. Between 2009 and 2018, the percentage of lots less than 7,000 sq. ft. 
increased from 25% to 32% of lots. 
o Larger multifamily units. Between 1999 and 2018, the median size of new multifamily 
dwelling units increased by 5.4% nationally. In the western region, the median size 
decreased by 2.0%. Nationally, the percentage of new multifamily units with more 
than 1,200 sq. ft. increased from 28% in 1999 to 36% in 2018 and increased from 25% 
to 29% in the western region.

o Household amenities. Across the United States since 2013, an increasing number of 
new units had air-conditioning (fluctuating year by year at over 90% for both new 
single-family and multifamily units). In 2000, 93% of new single-family houses had 
two or more bathrooms, compared to 96% in 2018. The share of new multifamily 
units with two or more bathrooms decreased from 55% of new multifamily units to 
44%. As of 2018, 92% of new single-family houses in the United States had garages 
for one or more vehicles (from 89% in 2000). 
o Shared amenities. Housing with shared amenities grew in popularity, as it may 
improve space efficiencies and reduce per-unit costs/maintenance costs. Single-room 
occupancies (SROs), 22 cottage clusters, cohousing developments, and multifamily 
products are common housing types that take advantage of this trend. Shared 
amenities may take many forms and include shared bathrooms, kitchens, other 
home appliances (e.g., laundry facilities, outdoor grills), security systems, outdoor 
areas (e.g., green spaces, pathways, gardens, rooftop lounges), fitness rooms, 
swimming pools, tennis courts, and free parking.23  
State Trends 
Oregon’s 2016–2020 Consolidated Plan includes a detailed housing needs analysis as well as 
strategies for addressing housing needs statewide. The plan concludes that “a growing gap 
between the number of Oregonians who need affordable housing and the availability of 
affordable homes has given rise to destabilizing rent increases, an alarming number of evictions 
of low- and fixed- income people, increasing homelessness, and serious housing instability 
throughout Oregon.” 
It identified the following issues that describe housing need statewide:24 
 
For housing to be considered affordable, a household should pay up to one-third of their 
income toward rent, leaving money left over for food, utilities, transportation, medicine, 
and other basic necessities. Today, one in two Oregon households pays more than one-
third of their income toward rent, and one in three pays more than half of their income 
toward rent.

 
More school children are experiencing housing instability and homelessness. The rate of 
K–12 homeless children increased by 12% from the 2013–2014 school year to the 2014–
2015 school year. 
 
Oregon has 28,500 rental units that are affordable and available to renters with 
extremely low incomes. There are about 131,000 households that need those apartments, 
leaving a gap of 102,500 units. 
 
Housing instability is fueled by an unsteady, low-opportunity employment market. 
Over 400,000 Oregonians are employed in low-wage work. Low-wage work is a growing 
share of Oregon’s economy. When wages are set far below the cost needed to raise a 
family, the demand for public services grows to record heights.  
 
Women are more likely than men to end up in low-wage jobs. Low wages, irregular 
hours, and part-time work compound issues.  
 
People of color historically constitute a disproportionate share of the low-wage work 
force. About 45% of Latinx, and 50% of African Americans, are employed in low-wage 
industries. 
 
The majority of low-wage workers are adults over the age of 20, many of whom have 
earned a college degree, or some level of higher education. 
 
In 2019, minimum wage in Oregon25 was $11.25, compared to $12.50 in the Portland 
Metro, and $11.00 for nonurban counties.  
Oregon’s 2018 Statewide Housing Plan identified six housing priorities to address in communities 
across the State over 2019 to 2023, summarized below. It includes relevant data to help illustrate 
the rationale for each priority. The 2018 Statewide Housing Plan describes the Oregon Housing 
and Community Services’ (OHCS) goals and implementation strategies for achieving the 
goals.26 
 
Equity and Racial Justice. Advance equity and racial justice by identifying and addressing 
institutional and systemic barriers that have created and perpetuated patterns of disparity in

o Summary of the Issue: In Oregon, 26% of people of color live below the poverty line, 
compared to 15% of the white population.

o 2019–2023 Goal: Communities of color will experience increased access to OHCS 
resources and achieve greater parity in housing stability, self-sufficiency, and 
homeownership. OHCS will collaborate with its partners and stakeholders to create 
a shared understanding of racial equity and overcome systemic injustices faced by 
communities of color in housing discrimination, access to housing, and economic 
prosperity. 
 
Homelessness. Build a coordinated and concerted statewide effort to prevent and end 
homelessness, with a focus on ending unsheltered homelessness of Oregon’s children and 
veterans. 
o Summary of the Issue: According to the Point-in-Time count, approximately 14,000 
Oregonians experienced homelessness in 2017, an increase of nearly 6% since 2015. 
Oregon’s unsheltered population increased faster than the sheltered population, and 
the state’s rate of unsheltered homelessness is the third highest in the nation at 57%. 
The state’s rate of unsheltered homelessness among people in families with children 
is the second highest in the nation at 52%. 
o 2019–2023 Goal: OHCS will drive toward impactful homelessness interventions by 
increasing the percentage of people who are able to retain permanent housing for at 
least six months after receiving homeless services to at least 85 percent. We will also 
collaborate with partners to end veterans’ homelessness in Oregon and build a 
system in which every child has a safe and stable place to call home. 
 
Permanent Supportive Housing. Invest in permanent supportive housing, a proven strategy 
to reduce chronic homelessness and reduce barriers to housing stability. 
o Summary of the Issue: Oregon needs about 12,388 units of permanent supportive 
housing to serve individuals and families with a range of needs and challenges. 
o 2019–2023 Goal: OHCS will increase our commitment to permanent supportive 
housing by funding the creation of 1,000 or more additional permanent supportive 
housing units to improve the future long-term housing stability for vulnerable 
Oregonians. 
 
Affordable Rental Housing. Work to close the affordable rental housing gap and reduce 
housing cost burden for low-income Oregonians. 
o Summary of the Issue: Statewide, over 85,000 new units are needed to house those 
households earning below 30% of median family income (MFI) in units affordable to 
them. The gap is even larger when accounting for the more than 16,000 units 
affordable at 30% of MFI, which are occupied by households at other income levels.  
o 2019–2023 Goal: OHCS will triple the existing pipeline of affordable rental housing 
—up to 25,000 homes in the development pipeline by 2023. Residents of affordable 
rental housing funded by OHCS will have reduced cost burden and more 
opportunities for prosperity and self-sufficiency. 
 
Homeownership. Provide more low- and moderate-income Oregonians with the tools to 
successfully achieve and maintain homeownership, particularly in communities of color. 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
34 
o Summary of the Issue: In Oregon, homeownership rates for all categories of people 
of color are lower than for white Oregonians. For white non-Latinx Oregonians, the 
home ownership rate is 63%. For Latinx and non-white Oregonians, it is 42%. For 
many, homeownership rates have fallen between 2005 and 2016. 
o 2019–2023 Goal: OHCS will assist at least 6,500 households in becoming successful 
homeowners through mortgage lending products while sustaining efforts to help 
existing homeowners retain their homes. OHCS will increase the number of 
homebuyers of color in our homeownership programs by 50% as part of a concerted 
effort to bridge the homeownership gap for communities of color while building 
pathways to prosperity. 
 
Rural Communities. Change the way OHCS does business in small towns and rural 
communities to be responsive to the unique housing and service needs and unlock the 
opportunities for housing development.  
o Summary of the Issue: While housing costs may be lower in rural areas, incomes are 
lower as well: Median family income is $42,750 for rural counties versus $54,420 for 
urban counties. Additionally, the median home values in rural Oregon are 30% 
higher than in the rural United States, and median rents are 16% higher. 
o 2019–2023 Goal: OHCS will collaborate with small towns and rural communities to 
increase the supply of affordable and market-rate housing. As a result of tailored 
services, partnerships among housing and service providers, private industry, and 
local governments will flourish, leading to improved capacity, leveraging of 
resources, and a doubling of the housing development pipeline.

Regional and Local Demographic Trends May Affect Housing Need in Silverton 
Demographic trends that might affect the key assumptions used in the baseline analysis of 
housing need are (1) the aging population, (2) changes in household size and composition, and 
(3) increases in diversity.  
An individual’s housing needs change throughout their life, with changes in income, family 
composition, and age. The types of housing needed by a 20-year-old college student differ from 
the needs of a 40-year-old parent with children, or an 80-year-old single adult. As Silverton’s 
population ages, different types of housing will be needed to accommodate older residents. The 
housing characteristics by age data below reveal this cycle in action in Silverton. 
Housing needs and 
preferences change in 
predictable ways over 
time, such as with 
changes in marital status 
and size of family. 
Families of different sizes 
need different types of 
housing.

Growing Population 
Silverton’s population growth will drive future demand for housing in the City over the 
planning period. The population forecast in Exhibit 24 is Silverton’s official population forecast 
from the Oregon Population Forecast Program. Silverton must use this forecast as the basis for 
forecasting housing growth over the 2020 to 2040 period. 
Silverton’s population grew by 83% between 1990 and 2018. Silverton added 4,690 new 
residents, at an average annual growth rate of 2.2%.

Aging Population 
This section shows two key characteristics of Silverton’s population, with implications for 
future housing demand in Silverton: 
 
Seniors. Silverton currently has a smaller share of people over 60 years old than Marion 
County. As Silverton’s senior population grows, it will have increasing demand for 
housing that is suitable for elderly residents. 
Demand for housing for seniors will grow over the planning period, as Baby Boomers 
continue to age and retire. The Marion County forecast share of residents aged 60 years 
and older will account for 25% of its population (2040), compared to around 21% in the 
2013–2017 period. 
The impact of growth in seniors in Silverton will depend, in part, on whether older 
people already living in Silverton continue to reside there as they retire. National 
surveys show that, in general, most retirees prefer to age in place by continuing to live in 
their current home and community as long as possible.28 Silverton may be attractive to 
newly retiring seniors because of its small-town characteristics and location within the 
Willamette Valley region. 
Growth in the number of seniors will result in demand for housing types specific to 
seniors, such as small and easy-to-maintain dwellings, assisted-living facilities, or 
age-restricted developments. Senior households will make a variety of housing choices 
as their health declines, including remaining in their homes as long as they are able; 
downsizing to smaller single-family homes (detached and attached), accessory dwelling 
units, cottages, or multifamily units; or moving into group housing (such as assisted-
living facilities or nursing homes). The challenges aging seniors face in continuing to live 
in their community include changes in health-care needs, loss of mobility, home 
maintenance difficulties, fixed incomes, and increases in property taxes.29 
 
Silverton has a larger proportion of youth and adolescence than Marion County and 
Oregon. About 33% of Silverton’s population is under 20 years old, compared to 28% of 
Marion County’s population and 24% of Oregon’s population. The forecast for 
population growth in Marion County shows the percent of people under 20 years old 
staying about the same, at 28% of the population in the 2013–2017 period to 27% of the 
population by 2040. 
People between 20 and 40 years of age are referred to as the Millennial generation and 
account for the largest share of the population in Oregon. By 2040, they will be between 
40 and 60 years of age. The forecast for Marion County shows a slight shift in Millennials 
from about 26% of the population in 2020 to about 23% of the population in 2040. 
                                                     
 
28 A survey conducted by the AARP indicates that 90% of people 50 years and older want to stay in their current 
home and community as they age. See http://www.aarp.org/research. 
29 “Aging in Place: A toolkit for Local Governments” by M. Scott Ball.

Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
38 
Silverton’s ability to attract and retain people in this age group will depend, in large 
part, on whether the city has opportunities for housing that both appeals to and is 
affordable to Millennials, as well as jobs that allow younger people to live and work in 
Silverton.  
In the near-term, Millennials may increase demand for rental units. The long-term 
housing preference of Millennials is uncertain. Research suggests that Millennials’ 
housing preferences may be similar to Baby Boomers, with a preference for single-family 
detached units, albeit smaller and less costly. Recent surveys about housing preference 
suggest that Millennials want affordable single-family homes in areas that offer 
transportation alternatives to cars, such as suburbs or small cities with walkable 
neighborhoods.30  
A recent survey of people living in the Portland region shows that Millennials prefer 
single-family detached housing. The survey finds that housing price is the most 
important factor in choosing housing for younger residents.31 The survey results suggest 
Millennials are more likely than other groups to prefer housing in an urban 
neighborhood or town center. While this survey is for the Portland region, it shows 
similar results as national surveys and studies about housing preference for Millennials.  
Growth in Millennials and Seniors in Silverton will result in increased demand for both 
affordable single-family detached housing (such as small-lot single-family detached units and 
cottages), as well as increased demand for affordable townhouses and multifamily housing 
(such as duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, or apartments). Growth in these populations will 
result in increased demand for both ownership and rental opportunities, with an emphasis on 
housing that is comparatively affordable. There is potential for attracting new residents to 
housing in Silverton’s commercial areas, especially if the housing is relatively affordable and 
located in proximity to services.

Increased Ethnic Diversity 
The number of Latinx residents increased in Silverton (by about 137 people), while the share of 
Latinx individuals declined from 12% of Silverton’s population in 2000 to 10% of the population 
in the 2013–2017 period. Silverton is less ethnically diverse than both Marion County and 
Oregon.  
The U.S. Census Bureau forecasts that at the national level, the Latinx population will continue 
growing faster than most other non-Latinx populations between 2020 and 2040. The Census 
forecasts that the Latinx population will increase 93%, from 2016 to 2060, and foreign-born 
Latinx populations will increase by about 40% in that same time.32  
Continued growth in the Latinx population will affect Silverton’s housing needs in a variety of 
ways.33 Growth in first and, to a lesser extent, second and third generation Latinx immigrants, 
will increase demand for larger dwelling units to accommodate the, on average, larger 
household sizes for these households. Foreign-born households, including Latinx immigrants, 
are more likely to include multiple generations, requiring more space than smaller household 
sizes. As Latinx households integrate over generations, household size typically decreases, and 
housing needs become similar to housing needs for all households.  
According to the State of Hispanic Homeownership report from the National Association of 
Hispanic Real Estate Professionals,34 the Latinx population accounted for 32.4% of the nation’s 
household formation in 2018, up 3.8 percentage points from 2017. The rate of homeownership 
for Latinx households increased from 45.6% in 2015 to 47.1% in 2018. 35 The only demographic 
that increased their rate of homeownership from 2016 to 2017 was Latinx households. 
The State of Hispanic Homeownership report also cited the lack of affordable housing products as 
a substantial barrier to homeownership. The report found that Latinx households were more 
likely than non-Latinx households to be nuclear households, composed of married couples with 
children, and multigeneration households in the same home (such as parents and adult children 
living together). These housing preferences—affordability and larger household size—will 
influence the housing market as the Latinx population continues to grow.36 Accordingly, 
growth in Latinx households will likely result in increased demand for housing of all types, 
both for ownership and rentals, with an emphasis on housing that is comparatively affordable.

ethnicity, which are Hispanic or Latino (i.e., Latinx) and Not Hispanic or Latino (i.e., Non-Latinx). Latinx is an 
ethnicity and not a race, meaning individuals who identify as Latinx may be of any race. The share of the population 
that identifies as Latinx should not be added to percentages for racial categories.

the region, Marion county, and Oregon. 
Changes in Housing Costs 
Silverton’s median housing sales price was $429,000 in May of 2019 and has grown in cost over 
the last several years. Silverton’s housing sales were also generally higher than cities in the 
region. Between May 2016 and May 2019, the median cost of a home grew by $179,000 (72%) in 
Silverton.

Since 2000, housing costs 
in Silverton have increased 
faster than incomes, but to 
a lesser degree when 
compared to Marion County 
and Oregon. 
The household reported 
median value of a house in 
Silverton was 3.8 times the 
median household income 
in 2000, and 4.1 times the

in the 2013–2017 period.  
The decline of housing 
affordability in Silverton was 
similar to regional 
comparison cities (e.g., 
Salem, Molalla, and 
Sublimity). The housing-

Housing Affordability 
A typical standard used to determine housing affordability is that a household should pay no 
more than a certain percentage of household income for housing, including payments and 
interest or rent, utilities, and insurance. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 
guidelines indicate that households paying more than 30% of their income on housing 
experience “cost burden” and households paying more than 50% of their income on housing 
experience “severe cost burden.” Using cost burden as an indicator is one method of 
determining how well a city is meeting the Goal 10 requirement to provide housing that is 
affordable to all households in a community. 
About 19% of Silverton’s households are cost burdened and 11% are severely cost burdened. 
About 46% of renter households are cost burdened, compared with 23% of homeowners. 
Overall, Silverton has a slightly smaller share of cost-burdened households than Marion County 
and Oregon. 
For example, about 15% of Silverton’s households have an income of less than $25,000 per year. 
These households can afford rent of less than $625 per month, or a home with a value of less 
than $75,000. Most, but not all, of these households are cost burdened.  
Overall, about 30% of all 
households in Silverton are 
cost burdened. 
Silverton has one of the 
lower shares of cost-
burdened households 
relative to all comparison 
cities, Marion County, and 
Oregon for the 2013–2017 
period.

While cost burden is a common measure of housing affordability, it does have some limitations. 
Two important limitations are:  
 
A household is defined as cost burdened if the housing costs exceed 30% of their 
income, regardless of actual income. The remaining 70% of income is expected to be 
spent on non-discretionary expenses, such as food or medical care, and on discretionary 
expenses. Households with higher incomes may be able to pay more than 30% of their 
income on housing without impacting the household’s ability to pay for necessary non-
discretionary expenses. 
 
Cost burden compares income to housing costs and does not account for accumulated 
wealth. As a result, the estimate of how much a household can afford to pay for housing 
does not include the impact of a household’s accumulated wealth. For example, a 
household of retired people may have relatively low income, but they may have 
accumulated assets (such as profits from selling another house) that allow them to 
purchase a house that would be considered unaffordable to them based on the cost-
burden indicator.

Exhibit 63 illustrates the types of financially attainable housing by income level in Marion 
County. Generally speaking, however, lower-income households will be renters occupying 
existing housing. Newly built housing will be a combination of renters (most likely in 
multifamily housing) and homeowners. The types of housing affordable for the lowest-income 
households are limited to government-subsidized housing, manufactured housing, lower-cost 
single-family housing, and multifamily housing. The range of financially attainable housing 
increases with increased income.

Exhibit 66 compares the number of households by income with the number of units affordable 
to those households in Silverton. Silverton currently has a deficit of housing for households 
earning less than $35,000 a year and a need for higher-amenity housing for households earning 
more than $100,000 a year. Silverton has a deficit of more affordable housing types (such as 
government-subsidized housing, existing lower-cost apartments, and manufactured housing). 
Silverton shows that some households earning $100,000 or more could pay more for housing, 
showing that there may be unmet demand for high-amenity housing such as single-family 
detached housing and townhomes.

Summary of the Factors Affecting Silverton’s Housing Needs 
The purpose of the analysis thus far has been to provide background on the kinds of factors that 
influence housing choice. While the number and interrelationships among these factors ensure 
that generalizations about housing choice are difficult to make and prone to inaccuracies, it is a 
crucial step to informing the types of housing that will be needed in the future.  
There is no question that age affects housing type and tenure. Mobility is substantially higher 
for people aged 20 to 34. On average, people in that age group will also have less income than 
people who are older, and they are less likely to have children. These factors mean that younger 
households are much more likely to be renters, and renters are more likely to be in multifamily 
housing.  
The data illustrates what more detailed research has shown and what most people understand 
intuitively: life cycle and housing choice interact in ways that are predictable in the aggregate; 
age of the household head is correlated with household size and income; household size and 
age of household head affect housing preferences; and income affects the ability of a household 
to afford a preferred housing type. The connection between socioeconomic and demographic 
factors and housing choice is often described informally by giving names to households with 
certain combinations of characteristics: the "traditional family," the "never-marrieds," the 
"dinks" (dual-income, no kids), and the "empty-nesters."40 Thus, simply looking at the long 
wave of demographic trends can provide good information for estimating future housing 
demand.  
Still, one is ultimately left with the need to make a qualitative assessment of the future housing 
market. The following is a discussion of how demographic and housing trends are likely to 
affect housing in Silverton over the next 20 years:  
 Growth in housing will be driven by growth in population. Between 1990 and 2018, 
Silverton’s population grew by 4,690 people (83%). The population in Silverton’s UGB 
is forecasted to grow from 10,701 to 13,759, an increase of 3,058 people (29%) between 
2020 and 2040.41  
 Housing affordability is a growing challenge in Silverton. Housing affordability is a 
challenge across Marion County, and Silverton is affected by these regional trends. 
Housing prices are increasing faster than incomes in Silverton and Marion County, 
which is consistent with state and national challenges. Silverton has a modest supply of 
multifamily housing (about 15% of the city’s housing stock), but almost half of renter 
households are cost burdened (46%). Silverton’s key challenge over the next 20 years is 
providing opportunities for development of relatively affordable housing of all types, 
such as lower-cost single-family housing, townhouses and duplexes, market-rate 
multifamily housing, and government-subsidized affordable housing.  
                                                     
 
40 See Planning for Residential Growth: A Workbook for Oregon's Urban Areas (June 1997). 
41 This forecast is based on Marion County’s certified population estimate and the official forecast from the Oregon 
Population Forecast Program for the 2020 to 2040 period for Silverton, shown in Exhibit 24. 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
65 
 Without substantial changes in housing policy, on average, future housing will look 
a lot like past housing. That is the assumption that underlies any trend forecast, and 
one that is important when trying to address demand for new housing.  
The City’s residential policies can impact the amount of change in Silverton’s housing 
market, to some degree. If the City adopts policies to increase opportunities to build 
smaller-scale single-family and multifamily housing types (particularly multifamily 
housing that is affordable to lower and higher-income households), a larger percentage 
of new housing developed over the next 20 years in Silverton may begin to address the 
City’s needs. Examples of policies that the City could adopt to achieve this outcome 
include allowing a wider range of housing types (e.g., cottage housing, duplexes, 
triplexes, quadplexes, or townhouses) in single-family zones, ensuring that there is 
sufficient land zoned to allow single-family attached multifamily housing 
development, supporting development of government-subsidized affordable housing, 
and encouraging multifamily residential development in downtown. The degree of 
change in Silverton’s housing market, however, will depend on market demand for 
these types of housing in Marion County. 
 If the future differs from the past, it is likely to move in the direction of smaller 
units and more diverse housing types. Most of the evidence suggests that the bulk of 
the change will be in the direction of smaller average house and lot sizes for single-
family housing. This includes providing opportunities for the development of 
accessory dwelling units, cottage housing, smaller single-family detached homes, 
townhomes, and multifamily housing. 
Key demographic and economic trends that will affect Silverton’s future housing needs 
are (1) the aging of Baby Boomers and (2) the aging of Millennials. 
o The Baby Boomer’s population is continuing to age. The changes that affect Silverton’s 
housing demand as the population ages are that household sizes and 
homeownership rates decrease. The majority of Baby Boomers are expected to 
remain in their homes as long as possible, downsizing or moving when illness or 
other issues cause them to move. Demand for specialized senior housing, such as 
age-restricted housing or housing in a continuum of care from independent living to 
nursing home care, may grow in Silverton. 
o Millennials will continue to form households and make a variety of housing choices. As 
Millennials age, generally speaking, their household sizes will increase, and their 
homeownership rates will peak by about age 55. Between 2020 and 2040, 
Millennials (and the generation after) will be a key driver in demand for housing 
for families with children. The ability to attract Millennials will depend on the 
City’s availability of affordable renter and ownership housing. It will also 
depend on the location of new housing in Silverton, as many Millennials prefer 
to live in more urban environments.42 The decline in homeownership among the

Millennial generation has more to do with financial barriers rather than the 
preference to rent.43 
In summary, an aging population, increasing housing costs, housing affordability concerns for 
Millennials, and other variables are factors that support the need for smaller and less expensive 
units as well as a broader array of housing choices.

5. Housing Need in Silverton 
Project New Housing Units Needed in the Next 20 Years 
The results of the Housing Needs Analysis are based on (1) the official population forecast for 
growth in Silverton over the 20-year planning period; (2) information about Silverton’s housing 
market relative to Marion County, Oregon, and nearby cities; and (3) the demographic 
composition of Silverton’s existing population and expected long-term changes in the 
demographics of Marion County. 
Forecast for Housing Growth 
This section describes the key assumptions and presents an estimate of new housing units 
needed in Silverton between 2020 and 2040. The key assumptions are based on the best 
available data and may rely on safe harbor provisions, when available.44  
 
Population. A 20-year population forecast (in this instance, 2020 to 2040) is the 
foundation for estimating needed new dwelling units. Silverton’s UGB will grow from 
10,701 persons in 2020 to 13,759 persons in 2040, an increase of 3,058 people.45  
 
Persons in Group Quarters.46 Persons in group quarters do not consume standard 
housing units: thus, any forecast of new people in group quarters is typically derived 
from the population forecast for the purpose of estimating housing demand. Group 
quarters can have a big influence on housing in cities with colleges (dorms), prisons, or a 
large elderly population (nursing homes). In general, any new requirements for these 
housing types will be met by institutions (colleges, government agencies, health-care 
corporations) operating outside what is typically defined as the housing market. 
Nonetheless, group quarters require residential land. They are typically built at densities 
that are comparable to that of multifamily dwellings. 
                                                     
 
44 A safe harbor is an assumption that a city can use in a housing needs analysis that the state has said will satisfy the 
requirements of Goal 14. OAR 660-024 defines a safe harbor as “an optional course of action that a local government 
may use to satisfy a requirement of Goal 14. Use of a safe harbor prescribed in this division will satisfy the 
requirement for which it is prescribed. A safe harbor is not the only way, or necessarily the preferred way, to comply 
with a requirement and it is not intended to interpret the requirement for any purpose other than applying a safe 
harbor within this division.” 
45 This forecast is based on Silverton UGB’s official forecast from the Oregon Population Forecast Program for the 
2020 to 2040 period.  
46 The Census Bureau's definition of group quarters is as follows: “A group quarters is a place where people live or 
stay, in a group living arrangement, that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or 
services for the residents. The Census Bureau classifies all people not living in housing units (house, apartment, 
mobile home, rented rooms) as living in group quarters. There are two types of group quarters: (1) institutional, such 
as correctional facilities, nursing homes, or mental hospitals and (2) Non-Institutional, such as college dormitories, 
military barracks, group homes, missions, or shelters.”

The 2013–2017 American Community Survey shows that 0.8% of Silverton’s 
population was in group quarters. For the 2020 to 2040 period, we assume that 0.8% 
of Silverton’s new population, approximately 25 people, will be in group quarters.  
 
Household Size. OAR 660-024 established a safe harbor assumption for average 
household size—which is the figure from the most-recent Decennial Census at the time 
of the analysis. According to the 2013–2017 American Community Survey, the average 
household size in Silverton was 2.75 people. Thus, for the 2020 to 2040 period, we 
assume an average household size of 2.75 persons. 
 
Vacancy Rate. The Census defines vacancy as "unoccupied housing units . . . determined 
by the terms under which the unit may be occupied, e.g., for rent, for sale, or for 
seasonal use only." The 2010 Census identified vacancy through an enumeration, 
separate from (but related to) the survey of households. The Census determines vacancy 
status and other characteristics of vacant units by enumerators obtaining information 
from property owners and managers, neighbors, rental agents, and others. 
Vacancy rates are cyclical and represent the lag between demand and the market’s 
response to demand for additional dwelling units. Vacancy rates for rental and 
multifamily units are typically higher than those for owner-occupied and single-
family dwelling units. 
OAR 660-024 established a safe harbor assumption for vacancy rate—which is the 
figure from the current Decennial Census. According to the 2013–2017 American 
Community Survey, Silverton’s vacancy rate was 5.0%. For the 2020 to 2040 period, 
we assume a vacancy rate of 5.0%. 
Silverton will have 
demand for 1,158 new 
dwelling units over the 
20-year period, with an 
annual average of 58 
dwelling units.

Housing Units Needed Over the Next 20 Years 
Exhibit 67 presents a forecast of new housing in Silverton’s UGB for the 2020 to 2040 period. 
This section determines the needed mix and density for the development of new housing 
developed over this 20-year period in Silverton. 
Over the next 20-years, the need for new housing developed in Silverton will generally include 
a wider range of housing types and housing that is more affordable. This conclusion is based on 
the following information, found in Chapter 3 and 4: 
 
Silverton’s housing mix, like Marion County, is predominately single-family detached. 
In the 2013–2017 period, 80% of Silverton’s housing was single-family detached, 5% was 
single-family attached, and 15% was multifamily. In comparison, the mix of housing for 
the county was 72% single-family detached, 4% single-family attached, and 25% 
multifamily. 
 
Demographic changes in Silverton suggest increases in demand for single-family 
attached housing and multifamily housing. The key demographic trends that will affect 
Silverton’s future housing needs are the aging of Baby Boomers and the household 
formation of Millennials. The implications of these trends are increased demand from 
small, older (often single person) households and increased demand for affordable 
housing for families, both for ownership and rent.  
 
Silverton’s median household income was $60,603, about $6,700 higher than Marion 
County’s median. Approximately 42% of Silverton’s households earn less than $50,000 
per year, compared to 46% in Marion County and 45% in Oregon. 
 
Silverton needs more affordable housing types for homeowners. Housing sales prices 
increased in Silverton over the last three years. From May 2016 to May 2019, the median 
housing sales price increased by about $179,000 (72%), from about $250,000 to $429,000. 
About 23% of Silverton’s homeowners are cost burdened. 
A household earning 100% of Silverton’s median household income ($60,600) could 
afford a home valued between $212,000 and $242,000, which is about $200,000 less than 
the median home sales price of $429,000 in Silverton. A household can start to afford 
median home sales prices at about 180% of Silverton’s median household income. 
Roughly 18% of Silverton’s households could afford a home at the median home sales 
price. 
 
Silverton needs more affordable housing types for renters. A household can start to 
afford Silverton’s median rents at about 60% of Silverton’s median household income. 
About 46% of Silverton’s renters were cost burdened and 17% were severely cost 
burdened. The rates of cost burden for Silverton renters suggests a need for more 
affordable housing types for renters. Little multifamily housing was built in Silverton 
since 2000, which likely exacerbated the lack of affordable multifamily housing. 
These factors suggest that Silverton needs a broader range of housing types with a wider range 
of price points than are currently available in Silverton’s housing stock. This includes providing 
ECONorthwest

70 
opportunity for the development of housing types across the affordability spectrum, such as 
single-family detached housing (e.g., small-lot single-family detached units, accessory dwelling 
units, cottages, and “traditional” single-family housing), townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, 
quadplexes, and multifamily housing with five or more units (e.g., apartments and 
condominiums). 
Exhibit 68 shows the forecast of needed housing in the Silverton UGB during the 2020 to 2040 
period. The projection is based on the following assumptions: 
 
Silverton’s official forecast for population growth shows that the city will add 3,058 
people over the 20-year period. Exhibit 67 shows that the new population will result in 
the need for 1,158 new dwelling units over the 20-year period. 
 
The assumptions about the mix of housing in Exhibit 68 are: 
o About 65% of new housing will be single-family detached, a category which 
includes manufactured housing. About 80% of Silverton’s housing was single-family 
detached in the 2013–2017 period.  
o Nearly 7% of new housing will be single-family attached. About 5% of Silverton’s 
housing was single-family attached in the 2013–2017 period. 
o About 13% of new housing will be duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes. About 8% 
of Silverton’s housing was duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes in the 2013–2017 
period. 
o About 15% of new housing will be multifamily with five or more units. About 7% 
of Silverton’s housing was multifamily with five or more units in the 2013–2017 
period.

Exhibit 69 allocates needed housing to plan designations in Silverton. The allocation is based, in 
part, on the types of housing allowed by zone in each plan designation. Exhibit 69 shows: 
 Single-Family Residential land will accommodate new single-family detached 
housing (including manufactured houses on lots and in parks) accessory dwelling 
units, single-family attached housing, and duplexes in the R-1 zone, R-5 zone, or both.  
 Multifamily Residential land will accommodate new single-family detached houses 
(including manufactured houses on lots and in parks and accessory dwelling units), 
single-family attached houses, duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, and multifamily 
housing with five or more units. 
 Agriculture / Urban Reserve land can accommodate single-family detached housing 
(including manufactured houses on lot and in parks), duplexes, and accessory dwelling 
units. 
 Commercial land will accommodate new dwelling unit(s) built in conjunction with a 
commercial use. New freestanding dwelling units are permitted in the Downtown 
Commercial zone (DFC) only.

Exhibit 70 shows future housing densities, based on historical densities, in net and gross acres.47 
Exhibit 70 converts between net acres and gross acres to account for land needed for rights-of-
way based on empirical analysis of existing rights-of-way by plan designation in Silverton.  
 Single-Family Residential: 24% of land is in rights-of-way in this plan designation. 
The densities in this designation average 4.8 dwelling units per net acre and 3.7 
dwelling units per gross acre.  
 Multifamily Residential: 17% of land is in rights-of-way in this plan designation. The 
densities in this designation vary due to plan designation/zoning conflicts.48 Exhibit 8 
shows that all vacant land in the Multifamily plan designation is zoned R-1 and R-5. 
This plan designation allows densities up to 20 units per acre in RM-10 and up to 32 
units per acre in RM-20. The future densities for development in this zone are based on 
historical development densities by zone in the Multifamily residential designation 
(shown in Exhibit 16): 
                                                     
 
47 OAR 660-024-0010(6) defines net buildable acre as “43,560 square feet of residentially designated buildable land 
after excluding future rights-of-way for streets and roads.” While the administrative rule does not include a 
definition of a gross buildable acre, using the definition above, a gross buildable acre will include areas used for 
rights-of-way for streets and roads. Areas used for rights-of-way are considered unbuildable. 
48 The Multifamily plan designation should be composed of RM-10 and RM-20 zoned parcels, but it also contains R-1 
and R-5 zoned parcels. All the buildable acreage in the Multifamily plan designation is zoned R-1 and R-5 (which 
technically belong to the Single-Family plan designation). This will impact housing capacity in the Multifamily plan 
designation.  
ECONorthwest

o Densities in this designation, zoned R-1, average 4.5 dwelling units per net acre and 
3.8 dwelling units per gross acre. This analysis assumes that the 14 buildable acres of 
R-1 land in the Multifamily plan designation will develop at this density (3.8 
dwelling units per gross acre). 
o Densities in this designation, zoned R-5, average 8.1 dwelling units per net acre and 
6.8 dwelling units per gross acre. This analysis assumes that the 5 buildable acres of 
R-5 land in the Multifamily plan designation will develop at this density (6.8 
dwelling units per gross acre). 
o Densities in this designation, zoned RM-10 and RM-20, average 20.8 dwelling units 
per net acre and 17.5 dwelling units per gross acre. This is based on the analysis of 
multifamily housing density in those respective zones and plan designation (see 
Exhibit 16). There is currently no land in the Multifamily designation zoned in either 
of these zones. 
 Agriculture/Urban Reserve: 30% of land is in rights-of-way. The densities in this 
designation average 3.7 dwelling units per net acre and 2.6 dwelling units per gross 
acre. 
 Commercial: 29% of land is in rights-of-way. The densities in this designation average 
17.7 dwelling units per net acre and 12.6 dwelling units per gross acre.

Needed Housing by Income Level 
The next step in the Housing Needs Analysis is to develop an estimate of need for housing by 
income and housing type. This analysis requires an estimate of the income distribution of 
current and future households in the community. Estimates presented in this section are based 
on (1) secondary data from the Census and (2) analysis by ECONorthwest. 
The analysis in Exhibit 71 is based on Census data about household income levels in Silverton. 
Income is distributed into market segments consistent with HUD income level categories, using 
Marion County’s 2019 median family income (MFI) of $69,400. The exhibit assumes that 
approximately the same percentage of households will be in each market segment in the future.  
About 35% of Silverton’s 
future households will have 
incomes about 120% of 
Marion County’s median 
family income (about 
$83,280 or more).  
About 27% will have 
incomes less than 50% of 
the County’s MFI ($34,700 
or less).  
This graph shows that, as 
Silverton’s population 
grows, Silverton will 
continue to have demand 
for housing across the 
affordability spectrum and 
particularly in the higher-
income bracket.

Need for Government-Assisted, Farmworker, and 
Manufactured Housing 
ORS 197.303, 197.307, 197.312, and 197.314 require cities to plan for government-assisted 
housing, farmworker housing, manufactured housing on lots, and manufactured housing in 
parks. 
 
Government-subsidized housing. Government subsidies can apply to all housing types 
(e.g., single family detached, apartments, etc.). Silverton allows the development of 
government-assisted housing in all residential plan designations, with the same 
development standards for market-rate housing. This analysis assumes that Silverton 
will continue to allow government housing in all of its residential plan designations. 
Because government-assisted housing is similar in character to other housing (with the 
exception being the subsidies), it is not necessary to develop separate forecasts for 
government-subsidized housing.  
 
Farmworker housing. Farmworker housing can also apply to all housing types, and the 
City allows development of farmworker housing in all residential zones, with the same 
development standards as market-rate housing. This analysis assumes that Silverton 
will continue to allow farmworker housing in all of its residential zones. Because it is 
similar in character to other housing (with the possible exception of government 
subsidies, if population restricted), it is not necessary to develop separate forecasts for 
farmworker housing. 
 
Manufactured housing on lots. Silverton allows manufactured homes on lots in all 
residential zones.  
 
Manufactured housing in parks. Silverton conditionally allows manufactured homes in 
parks in R-5 and RM-10 zones (design review is required). OAR 197.480(4) requires cities 
to inventory the mobile home or manufactured dwelling parks sited in areas planned 
and zoned or generally used for commercial, industrial, or high-density residential 
development. According to the Oregon Housing and Community Services’ 
Manufactured Dwelling Park Directory,49 Silverton has two manufactured home parks 
with 125 spaces.  
 
ORS 197.480(2) requires Silverton to project the need for manufactured dwelling parks 
based on (1) population projections, (2) household income levels, (3) housing market 
trends, and (4) an inventory of manufactured dwelling parks sited in areas planned and 
zoned or generally used for commercial, industrial, or high-density residential 
development.  
o Exhibit 67 shows that Silverton will grow by 1,158 dwelling units over the 2020 to 
2040 period.

o Analysis of housing affordability shows that about 25% of Silverton’s new 
households will be considered “very low income” or “extremely low income,” 
earning 50% or less of the region’s median family income. One type of housing 
affordable to these households is manufactured housing. 
o Manufactured housing accounts for about 4% of Silverton’s current housing stock 
(2013–2017).  
o National, state, and regional trends since 2000 showed that manufactured housing 
parks are closing, rather than being created. For example, between 2000 and 2015, 
Oregon had 68 manufactured parks close, with more than 2,700 spaces. Discussions 
with several stakeholders familiar with manufactured home park trends suggest that 
over the same period, few to no new manufactured home parks have opened in 
Oregon.  
o The households most likely to live in manufactured homes in parks are those with 
incomes between $20,190 and $53,840 (30% to 50% of MFI), which includes 33% of 
Silverton’s households. However, households in other income categories may live in 
manufactured homes in parks.  
 
National and state trends of closure of manufactured home parks, and the fact that 
no new manufactured home parks have opened in Oregon in over the last 15 years, 
demonstrate that the development of new manufactured home parks in Silverton is 
unlikely.  
 
Our conclusion from this analysis is that the development of new manufactured 
home parks or subdivisions in Silverton over the 2020 to 2040 planning period is 
unlikely, although they may still continue to locate on individual lots. The forecast of 
housing assumes that no new manufactured home parks will be opened in Silverton 
over the 2020 to 2040 period. The forecast includes new manufactured homes on lots 
in the category of single-family detached housing. 
o Over the next 20 years (or longer), one or more manufactured home parks may close 
in Silverton. This may be a result of manufactured home park landowners selling or 
redeveloping their land for uses with higher rates of return, rather than lack of 
demand for spaces in manufactured home parks. Manufactured home parks 
contribute to the supply of low-cost affordable housing options, especially for 
affordable homeownership.  
 
While there is statewide regulation of the closure of manufactured home parks 
designed to lessen the financial difficulties of this closure for park residents,50 the 
City has a role to play in ensuring that there are opportunities for housing for the 
                                                     
 
50 ORS 90.645 regulates rules about closure of manufactured dwelling parks. Before closure of the park, the landlord 
must give at least one year’s notice of park closure and pay the tenant between $5,000 and $9,000 for each 
manufactured dwelling park space, in addition to not charging tenants for demolition costs of abandoned 
manufactured homes.

77 
displaced residents. The City’s primary roles are to ensure that there is sufficient 
land zoned for new multifamily housing and to reduce barriers to residential 
development to allow for the development of new, relatively affordable housing. 
The City may use a range of policies to encourage the development of relatively 
affordable housing, such as allowing a wider range of moderate-density housing 
(e.g., duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, or cottages) in lower-density zones, 
designating more land for multifamily housing, removing barriers to multifamily 
housing development (such as design review), using tax credits to support 
affordable housing production, or partnering with a developer of government-
subsidized affordable housing.

6. Residential Land Sufficiency within 
Silverton 
This chapter presents an evaluation of the sufficiency of vacant residential land in Silverton to 
accommodate expected residential growth over the 2020 to 2040 period. This chapter includes 
an estimate of residential development capacity (measured in new dwelling units) and an 
estimate of Silverton’s ability to accommodate needed new housing units for the 2020 to 2040 
period, based on the analysis in the Housing Needs Analysis. The chapter ends with a 
discussion of the conclusions and recommendations for the Housing Needs Analysis.  
Capacity Analysis 
The buildable lands inventory summarized in Chapter 2 (and presented in full in Appendix A) 
provides a supply analysis (buildable land by type), and Chapter 5 provides a demand analysis 
(population and growth leading to demand for more residential development). The comparison 
of supply and demand allows the determination of land sufficiency. 
There are two ways to calculate estimates of supply and demand into common units of 
measurement to allow their comparison: (1) housing demand can be converted into acres, or (2) 
residential land supply can be converted into dwelling units. A complication of either approach 
is that not all land has the same characteristics. Factors such as zone, slope, parcel size, and 
shape can affect the ability of land to accommodate housing. Methods that recognize this fact 
are more robust and produce more realistic results. This analysis uses the second approach: it 
estimates the ability of vacant residential lands within the UGB to accommodate new housing. 
This analysis, sometimes called a “capacity analysis,”51 can be used to evaluate different ways 
that vacant residential land may build out by applying different assumptions.  
 
 
                                                     
 
51 There is ambiguity in the term capacity analysis. It would not be unreasonable for one to say that the “capacity” of 
vacant land is the maximum number of dwellings that could be built based on density limits defined legally by plan 
designation or zoning, and that development usually occurs—for physical and market reasons—at something less 
than full capacity. For that reason, we have used the longer phrase to describe our analysis: “estimating how many 
new dwelling units the vacant residential land in the UGB is likely to accommodate.” That phrase is, however, 
cumbersome, and it is common in Oregon and elsewhere to refer to that type of analysis as “capacity analysis,” so we 
use that shorthand occasionally in this memorandum.  
ECONorthwest  
Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
79 
Silverton Capacity Analysis Results 
The capacity analysis estimates the development potential of vacant residential land to 
accommodate new housing, based on the needed densities by the housing type categories 
shown in Exhibit 70. 
Exhibit 72 shows that Silverton has 2,320 acres of vacant or partially vacant land to 
accommodate dwelling units, based on the following assumptions:  
 
Buildable residential land. The capacity estimates start with the number of buildable 
acres in the residential plan designations that allow residential uses outright, as shown 
in Exhibit 8.  
o The Single-Family plan designation has 531 buildable acres. 
o The Multifamily plan designation includes 19 acres. 
 
Land zoned R-1 and R-5 account for all 19 acres of available buildable 
land in that plan designation.  
 
There is no vacant or partially vacant buildable land zoned RM-10 and 
RM-20 in the Multifamily plan designation (see Exhibit 8). The capacity 
analysis in Exhibit 72 shows that all existing vacant buildable land in the 
Multifamily plan designation will be built at densities consistent with the 
Single-Family plan designation. 
o The Agriculture/Urban Reserve plan designation comprises 104 buildable acres. 
 
Future densities. The capacity analysis assumes development will occur at historic 
densities. Those densities were derived from the future densities shown in Exhibit 70.

80 
Residential Land Sufficiency 
The next step in the analysis of the sufficiency of residential land within Silverton is to compare 
the demand for housing by plan designation with the capacity of land by plan designation 
(Exhibit 72). Exhibit 73 shows that Silverton:  
 
Has sufficient land to accommodate housing development in the Single-Family plan 
designation and in Agricultural / Urban Reserve plan designation. Silverton has a 
surplus of about 1,422 dwelling units (384 acres) in the Single-Family plan designation 
and a surplus of 32 dwelling units (12 acres) in Agricultural / Urban Reserve plan 
designation. 
 
Does not have sufficient land to accommodate housing development in the 
Multifamily plan designation. In the Multifamily plan designation: 
o R-1 and R-5 has capacity to accommodate 85 dwelling units. The analysis 
assumes that land in these zones develops over the 20-year planning period and 
that there is no further demand for land in these zones within the Multifamily 
plan designation (i.e. that further demand for housing in these zones will be 
accommodated in the Single-Family plan designation). 
o Silverton does not have any capacity for housing in the RM-10 and RM-20, which 
are zones consistent with the Multifamily plan designation. With housing 
demand at 292 dwelling units, Silverton does not have sufficient buildable land 
to accommodate those units over the 2020 to 2040 planning period. 
None of the land in the Multifamily plan designation is zoned for RM-10 or RM-20, which allow 
densities of 10 to 20 dwelling units per acre and 20 to 32 dwelling units per acre, respectively. In 
other words, Silverton has no land designated for development of housing at multifamily 
densities. All new housing in the Multifamily plan designation will be developed at average 
densities consistent with the R-1 zone (3.8 dwelling units per gross acre) or R-5 zone (6.8 
dwelling units per gross acre) because those are the zones where remaining buildable land 
exists in the Multifamily plan designation.

Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
81 
For the 2020 to 2040 planning period, 25 group quarter units were deducted from the housing 
forecast (see Exhibit 67). The analysis must still account for their land need. The analysis 
assumes some development of group quarters will occur in Single-Family areas (at a density of 
3.7 dwelling units per gross acre) and some development of group quarters will occur in 
Multifamily areas (at a density of 17.5 dwelling units per gross acre).52  
Group quarters is forecast to require approximately five gross acres of residential land over the 
20-year analysis period. The following provides context for the group quarters calculation: 
 
Exhibit 73 shows Silverton’s preliminary land sufficiency results.  
 
Exhibit 74 shows the land need calculation for group quarters.  
o Silverton will need 3.5 gross acres of land in the Single-Family plan designation 
and nearly 1 gross acre of land in the Multifamily plan designation to 
accommodate group quarters. 
 
Exhibit 75 shows the revised land sufficiency results (i.e., the final comparison), after 
accounting for group quarters in the analysis.

land sufficiency for the 20-year planning period, including land needed for group quarters. In 
summary: 
 
A surplus of capacity (1,409 dwelling units) in the Single-Family plan designation, 
results in a surplus of 381 gross acres of Single-Family land to accommodate new 
housing (at 3.7 dwelling units per gross acre). 
 
A deficit of capacity for multifamily housing (304 dwelling units or 17 gross acres) in the 
Multifamily plan designation. 
o A balance of capacity in the Multifamily plan designation (for land zoned R-1 
and R-5), results in neither a surplus nor a deficit of gross acres to accommodate 
new housing (at 3.8 and 6.8 dwelling units per gross acre, respectively). 
o A deficit of capacity (304 dwelling units) in in the Multifamily plan designation 
(for land zoned RM-10 and RM-20) results in a deficit of gross acres to 
accommodate new housing (at 17.5 dwelling units per gross acre). 
 
A surplus of capacity (32 dwelling units) in Agriculture / Urban Reserve plan 
designation, results in a surplus of 12 gross acres to accommodate new housing (at 2.6 
dwelling units per gross acre).

Silverton Housing Needs Analysis

Conclusions 
The key findings of the Silverton Housing Needs Analysis are that:  
 
Growth in housing will be driven by growth in population. Silverton is forecast to 
grow from 10,701 people to 13,759 people, an increase of 3,058 residents between 2020 
and 2040. The 3,058 new residents will result in 1,158 new households.  
 
To accommodate households in the Silverton UGB, the City is planning for 1,158 new 
dwelling units. To accommodate the 1,158 dwelling units over the 20-year planning 
period, Silverton will average 58 new dwelling units annually.  
 
Silverton will plan for more single-family attached and multifamily dwelling units in 
the future to meet the City’s housing needs. Historically, about 80% of Silverton’s 
housing was single-family detached. New housing in Silverton is forecast to be 65% 
single-family detached, 7% single-family attached, and 28% multifamily (13% will be 
duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes, and 15% will be multifamily housing with five or 
more units). 
o The factors driving the shift in types of housing needed in Silverton include changes 
in demographics and decreases in housing affordability. The aging of senior 
populations and the household formation of young adults will drive demand for 
renter- and owner-occupied housing, such as small single-family detached housing; 
townhouses; duplexes, triplexes, and quadplexes; accessory dwelling units; cottages; 
and apartments or condominiums. Both groups may prefer housing in walkable 
neighborhoods, with access to services.  
o Silverton’s existing deficit of housing that is affordable for low and high-income 
households indicates a need for a wider range of housing types, for renters and 
homeowners. About 30% of Silverton’s households have affordability problems, 
including a cost-burden rate of 46% for renter households, 17% of whom are severely 
cost burdened (i.e., spending 50% or more of their income on housing costs).  
o Without diversification of housing types, lack of affordability will continue to be a 
problem, possibly growing in the future if incomes continue to grow at a slower rate 
than housing costs. Under the current conditions, 306 of the forecasted new 
households will have incomes of $34,700 (in 2017 dollars) or less (50% of MFI income 
or less). These households generally cannot afford market-rate housing. Another 442 
new households will have incomes between $34,700 and $55,500 (50% to 80% of 
MFI). These households will all need access to affordable housing, such as the 
housing types described above. 
 
Silverton cannot accommodate all of its multifamily housing needs on lands with 
existing zoning. Silverton has a deficit of land in the Multifamily Plan Designations, 
about 17 gross acres to accommodate 304 dwelling units. The deficits shown in Exhibit 
75 may be addressed in multiple ways. Reasonably, the City could rezone land in the 
existing Multifamily or Single-Family plan designation to densities consistent with the 
RM-10 and RM-20 zone. Currently, all available buildable land in the Multifamily plan 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
84 
designation is zoned at densities consistent with the Single-Family plan designation (R-1 
and R-5 zones).  
The City cannot adopt the housing needs analysis until it identifies how it will meet this 
17 gross acre deficit of land in the Multifamily Plan Designation. ORS 197.29653 requires 
that the City must adopt “measures” (i.e., policies) “…necessary to accommodate the 
estimated housing needs.” This means that the City must adopt policies, such as 
rezoning land, to meet the deficit of 17 gross acres of land in the RM-10 and RM-20 
zones. The could adopt other policies to that will help reduce or meet the deficit of land, 
such as planning for more multifamily mixed-use buildings in downtown or increasing 
residential density allowed in the RM-10 and RM-20 zones. 
 
Silverton has unmet needs for affordable housing. About 46% of households that rent 
and 23% of households that own their home are cost burdened. Silverton’s overall level 
of cost burden (30% of all households) is smaller than other communities in the region, 
but unmet housing needs remain, including: 
o Renter housing. The median gross rent for housing in Silverton in 2017 was about 
$902, which is affordable to households earning about 52% of the median family 
income (about $36,000). About 30% of Silverton’s households have income below 
this level and cannot afford the average rent. As cited above, many of these renter 
households are cost burdened. A small portion of this unmet housing need can be 
met through the development of income-restricted affordable housing. Silverton will 
continue to have unmet renter housing needs, both for existing households and for 
new households. 
o Owner-occupied housing. The median home sales price in May 2019 was about 
$429,000, which is affordable to households earning about 160% of the median 
family income (about $111,000). About 28% of Silverton’s households have income 
above $100,000. Silverton has relatively expensive housing for homeownership 
compared to the region, and households at middle incomes (between $55,520 and 
$83,280) are less able to afford housing in Silverton. One way to increase the supply 
of affordable owner-occupied housing is to increase opportunities for the 
development of the middle-income housing types, described above.  
 
Silverton will need to meet the requirements of House Bill 2001. The legislature 
passed House Bill 2001 in the 2019 legislative session. The bill requires cities with a 
population of 10,000 to 25,000 (which includes Silverton) to “allow the development of a 
duplex on each lot or parcel zoned for residential use that allows for the development of 
detached single-family dwellings.”  
 
Silverton allows duplexes as a permitted use in the R-1, R-5, RM-10, and RM-20 zones 
but not in the AR zone. To comply with House Bill 2001, Silverton will need to allow 
duplexes on all lots where single-family detached houses are allowed. That will require 
                                                     
 
53 This requirement is part of ORS 197.296(10)(b)(C).

allowing duplexes in the AR zone and changing the zoning standards in the City’s 
residential zones so that standards for duplexes match standards for single-family 
detached housing.  
In addition to complying with House Bill 2001, Silverton’s Housing Strategy outlines and 
describes specific polices, objectives, and actions to meet Silverton’s housing needs over the 
2020 to 2040 planning horizon.

Appendix A – Residential Buildable Lands 
Inventory 
The general structure of the buildable land (supply) analysis is based on the DLCD HB 2709 
workbook “Planning for Residential Growth: A Workbook for Oregon’s Urban Areas,” which 
specifically addresses residential lands. The buildable lands inventory uses methods and 
definitions that are consistent with Goal 10/OAR 660-008. This appendix describes the 
methodology that ECONorthwest used for this report, based on 2018 data. The results of the 
BLI are discussed in Chapter 2. 
Overview of the Methodology 
Following are the statutes and administrative rules that provide guidance on residential BLIs:  
OAR 660-008-0005(2):  
“Buildable Land” means residentially designated land within the urban growth boundary, including 
both vacant and developed land likely to be redeveloped, that is suitable, available and necessary for 
residential uses. Publicly owned land is generally not considered available for residential uses. Land 
is generally considered “suitable and available” unless it:  
(a) Is severely constrained by natural hazards as determined under Statewide Planning Goal 7;  
(b) Is subject to natural resource protection measures determined under Statewide Planning 
Goals 5, 6, 15, 16, 17 or 18; 
(c) Has slopes of 25 percent or greater; 
(d) Is within the 100-year flood plain; or  
(e) Cannot be provided with public facilities. 
Inventory Steps 
The BLI consists of several steps: 
1. Generating UGB “land base” 
2. Classifying land by development status 
3. Identifying constraints  
4. Verifying inventory results 
5. Tabulating and mapping results 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
87 
Step 1: Generating UGB “land base”  
Per Goal 10, this step involves selecting all of the tax lots in the Silverton UGB in residential or 
nonemployment plan designations, or plan designations composed of zones that allow housing 
outright. Plan designations in the residential inventory include: 
 
Single Family 
 
Multifamily 
 
Mobile Home Park 
 
Agriculture / Urban Reserves 
 
Commercial (Downtown Commerical zone [DFC]) 
Exhibit 76 shows the residential plan designations included in the BLI.

ECONorthwest  
Silverton Housing Needs Analysis 
89 
Step 2: Classifying lands  
In this step, ECONorthwest classified each tax lot, in a plan designation that allows residential 
uses, into one of five mutually exclusive categories based on development status: 
 
Developed land 
 
Vacant land 
 
Partially vacant land 
 
Undevelopable land 
 
Public or exempt land 
ECONorthwest initially identified buildable land and classified development status using a 
rule-based methodology consistent with the DLCD Residential Lands Workbook and applicable 
administrative rules. The rules are described below in Exhibit 77.

Statutory Authority 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton Housing Needs Analysis

Development Status 
Definition 
Statutory Authority 
Vacant Land 
Tax lots that have no structures or have 
buildings with very little improvement 
value. For the purpose of this inventory, 
lands with improvement values of less than 
$10,000 were considered vacant (not 
including lands that are identified as 
having mobile homes). 
OAR 660-008-0006(2) (2) “Buildable land” 
means residentially designated land within 
the urban growth boundary, including both 
vacant and developed land likely to be 
redeveloped, that is suitable, available, 
and necessary for residential uses. Publicly 
owned land is generally not considered 
available for residential uses. 
Partially Vacant Land 
Partially vacant tax lots can use safe 
harbor established in state statute: 
 
The infill potential of developed residential 
lots or parcels of one-half acre or more 
may be determined by subtracting one-
quarter acre (10,890 square feet) for the 
existing dwelling, assuming that the 
remainder is buildable land; 
OAR 660-024-0050 (2)(a) 
Undevelopable Land 
Vacant tax lots less than 3,000 square feet 
in size were considered undevelopable. 
No statutory definition 
Public or Exempt Land 
Lands in public or semipublic ownership 
are considered unavailable for residential 
development. This includes lands in 
federal, state, county, or city ownership as 
well as lands owned by churches and other 
semipublic organizations and properties 
with conservation easements. Public lands 
were identified using the assessor’s 
property tax exemption codes. 
OAR 660-008-0005(2) - Publicly owned 
land is generally not considered available 
for residential uses. 
Developed Land 
Land that is developed at densities 
consistent with zoning and improvements 
that make it unlikely to redevelop during 
the analysis period. Lands not classified as 
vacant, partially vacant, undevelopable, or 
public or exempt are considered 
developed. 
No statutory definition

Step 3: Identifying constraints 
Consistent with OAR 660-008-0005(2) guidance on residential buildable lands inventories, 
ECONorthwest deducted certain lands with development constraints from the BLI. We used the 
following constraints, as listed in Exhibit 78.

We treated these areas as prohibitive constraints (unbuildable) as shown in Exhibit 79. All 
constraints were merged into a single constraint file, which was then used to identify the area of 
each tax lot that is constrained. These areas were deducted from lands that are identified as 
vacant or partially vacant. 
Lack of access to water, sewer, power, road or other key infrastructure cannot be considered a 
prohibitive constraint unless it is an extreme condition. This is because tax lots that are currently 
unserviced could potentially become serviced over the 20-year planning period.

Step 4: Verifying 
ECONorthwest used a multi-step verification process. The first verification step involved a 
“rapid visual assessment” of land classifications using GIS and recent aerial photos. The rapid 
visual assessment involves reviewing classifications overlaid on recent aerial photographs to 
verify uses on the ground. ECONorthwest reviewed all tax lots included in the inventory using 
the rapid visual assessment methodology. The second round of verification involved City staff 
verifying the rapid visual assessment output. ECONorthwest amended the BLI based on City 
staff review and a discussion of the City’s comments. 
Step 5: Tabulating and mapping 
The results are presented in tabular and map format. We included a comprehensive plan map, 
the land base by classification, vacant and partially vacant lands by plan designation, and 
vacant and partially vacant lands by plan designation with constraints showing.

Beth Goodman and Sadie DiNatale, ECONorthwest 
SUBJECT: SILVERTON HOUSING POLICIES AND ACTIONS 
ECONorthwest is working with the City of Silverton to develop a housing needs analysis. The 
Housing Needs Analysis determines whether the City of Silverton has enough land to 
accommodate 20-years of population and housing growth. It provides the basis for an update to 
the City’s Comprehensive Plan Housing Element, as well as the development of an action plan 
to implement the housing policies. 
The City of Silverton has not updated its existing Comprehensive Plan housing policies since 
2000. This memorandum presents Silverton’s existing housing policies, discussed with the 
Affordable Housing Task Force (the Task Force) at their September, October, November, and 
December meetings (2019). Silverton may revise or substitute the policies based on continued 
Task Force, Planning Commission, City Council, and public conversations. 
This memorandum discusses housing affordability. It distinguishes between two types of 
affordable housing: (1) housing affordable to very low–income and extremely low–income 
households and (2) housing affordable to low-income and middle-income households. The 
following describes these households, based on information from the Housing Needs Analysis. 
 
Very low–income and extremely low–income households are those who have an 
income of 50% or less of the Marion County median family income (MFI),1 which is an 
annual household income of $34,700. About 17% of Silverton’s households fit into this 
category. They can afford a monthly housing cost of $870 or less.2 Development of 
housing affordable to households at this income level is generally accomplished through 
the development of government-subsidized income-restricted housing. 
 
Low-income and middle-income households are those who have incomes between 50% 
and 120% of Marion County’s MFI, or incomes between $34,700 and $83,280. About 38% 
of Silverton’s households fit into this category. They can afford a monthly housing cost 
between $870 and $2,080. The private housing market may develop housing affordable 
to households in this group, especially for the higher-income households in the group. 
Housing affordable to households in this income group is often referred to as 
“workforce housing.” 
                                                     
 
1 Median family income is determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 2019, Marion 
County’s MFI was $69,400. 
2 This assumes that households pay less than 30% of their gross income on housing costs, including rent or mortgage, 
utilities, home insurance, and property taxes.

Summary of Actions 
The table below summarizes the policy and action recommendations made by the Affordable Housing Task Force. The implementation 
schedule is based on discussions with the Committee about the actions they think are in need of prompt attention. While some of the 
actions may take longer than a year to implement, the check marks in the table represent the year implementation of each action should 
commence. In addition, some actions may be implemented together, such as recommended changes to the Development Code. 
Once the Planning Commission and City Council have reviewed and provided input on the Housing Strategy and the implementation 
schedule, City staff should begin to develop a work plan for implementation of the actions in the Housing Strategy, grouping like 
actions together for implementation.

1.1b: Develop criteria and a process for identifying land to up-zone (or rezone) to 
meet the deficit of land for multifamily development (in Action 1.1a). The criteria 
may include considerations of location, transportation access, access to and 
capacity of infrastructure, site size and development constraints, and other 
relevant criteria. The City should work with landowners of these sites to identify 
those who are interested in developing their land with multifamily housing and 
are interested in the change in zoning.

Objective 1.2: Identify opportunities to increase allowable densities in Silverton’s residential zones. 
1.2.a: Evaluate reducing the minimum lot size in the Single-Family Residential (R-
1) zone from 7,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet—possibly as low as 3,500 
square feet.  
 
 
 
 
 
1.2.b: Evaluate removing the maximum density standard and allowing the 
building height limitation, lot coverage standard, and parking requirement to 
limit density in the RM-20 zone. As an alternative, the City could evaluate 
increasing the maximum density in the Multifamily Family Residential (RM-20) 
zone from 32 dwelling units per acre to 40 or more units per acre.

Policy 2: Provide opportunities for housing development to meet the City’s identified housing needs.  
Objective 2.1: Modify the City’s Development Code to ensure compliance with the requirements of House Bill (HB) 2001, prior to the 
June 30, 2021. 
2.1.a: Revise Silverton’s Development Code to allow duplexes where single-
family dwellings are allowed in the following zones: R-1, R-5, RM-10, and RM-20. 
Currently, the R-1 zone allows duplexes on lots with the same size standards as 
single-family detached units. The lot size standards are different in the R-5, RM-
10, and RM-20 zones for duplexes and single-family detached units. 
 
 
 
 
 
Objective 2.2: Allow for and encourage a wider range of types of housing development within Silverton to meet the housing needs of 
all income levels 
2.2.a: In addition to the R-1 zone, allow single-room occupancies (SROs) in 
Silverton’s R-5, RM-10, and RM-20 zones, which would allow for the 
development or conversion of structures with multiple bedrooms and shared 
common spaces (i.e., shared kitchens and bathrooms), with the intention of 
allowing more than six unrelated persons to live in the same unit.

Objective 2.3: Review development standards to allow for development of a wider range of housing types, as discussed in Objective 
2.2. 
2.3.a: Conduct a broader audit of Silverton’s zoning code and development 
processes to identify barriers to residential development and identify alternatives 
for lowering or eliminating the barriers. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.b: Evaluate developing a form-based code approach to regulate the 
development of small apartments, cottages, tiny houses, and desired multifamily 
housing types in the R-1 and R-5 zones. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.c: Evaluate changing development standards for accessory dwelling units, 
including (1) removing the owner-occupied standard; (2) changing the size limit 
from 40% to 60% of the primary structure, but retaining the 800 square foot 
maximum size limit; and 3) allowing tiny homes as ADUs. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.d: Evaluate reductions to off-street parking requirements for multifamily 
housing, including for affordable housing serving seniors and other populations 
that may have lower car ownership. Consider requiring off-street parking but not 
parking garages. Also consider allowing on-street parking within a certain 
distance of a development to count for a specific number or percentage of off-
street parking required for that development.

Potential Housing Policies 
In addition to Silverton’s housing goal, this section presents the Affordable Housing Task 
Force’s recommended policies, objectives, and actions to address Silverton’s housing needs (as 
identified through Silverton’s Housing Needs Analysis). 
Policies, Objectives, and Actions 
Housing Goal: Ensure that there are opportunities to develop a diverse range of housing types 
in mixed-income neighborhoods, resulting in housing choices that are affordable at all income 
levels. 
Silverton recognizes the importance of ensuring that its residents have access to 
comprehensible information about the City’s housing market to understand the need for 
the policies and actions in the Housing Strategy—such information is crucial in gaining 
support for implementing the housing goal. Potential ways to further this would be to 
support community education about housing by providing assistance in writing articles 
about Silverton’s housing market for local newspapers and other news outlets, as well as 
having booths to provide information about housing and other key issues at community 
events, such as the Homer Davenport Community Festival, the Christmas Tree lighting, 
and the Silverton Fine Arts Festival. To facilitate outreach, City officials or volunteers could 
prepare the necessary materials for distribution.  
Action G.1: Hold public meetings and develop materials to provide information to 
the community about Silverton’s housing needs, using information from the 
Housing Needs Analysis. The topics of discussion should include those 
discussed throughout the Housing Strategy: (1) the overall need for housing that 
is affordable to extremely low to middle-income households, (2) the need for a 
wider range of housing types in Silverton to provide more opportunities for the 
development of market-rate housing affordable to middle-income households, 
(3) the need for and opportunities to support the development of income-
restricted housing affordable to extremely low and very low–income households, 
(4) the need for infrastructure (e.g., water, wastewater, and roads) to support the 
development of housing, and (5) options for paying for income-restricted 
housing development and infrastructure.  
Policy 1: Ensure an adequate supply of land is available and serviced. Plan for a 20-year supply 
of suitable land with urban services and the necessary services for Silverton to meet housing needs 
within the existing planning area.  
Objective 1.1: Ensure that there is sufficient land in each residential plan designation to 
meet the land needs identified in the Housing Needs Analysis.  
Action 1.1.a: Rezone land to address the deficits of land identified in the Housing 
Needs Analysis in the Multifamily Plan Designations, specifically in the RM-10 
and RM-20 zones.  
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
Action 1.1b: Develop criteria and a process for identifying land to up-zone (or 
rezone) to meet the deficit of land for multifamily development (in Action 1.1a). 
The criteria may include considerations of location, transportation access, access 
to and capacity of infrastructure, site size and development constraints, and 
other relevant criteria. The evaluation of opportunities for up-zoning land may 
result in identifications of individual sites or groupings of adjacent sites within 
the city. The City may consider rezoning industrial land to RM-10 or RM-20 if it 
has more industrial land than needed to accommodate growth over the next 20-
years. The City should work with landowners of these sites to identify those who 
are interested in developing their land with multifamily housing and are 
interested in the change in zoning. 
Objective 1.2: Identify opportunities to increase allowable densities in Silverton’s 
residential zones. 
Action 1.2.a: Evaluate reducing the minimum lot size in the Single-Family 
Residential (R-1) zone from 7,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet—possibly as 
low as 3,500 square feet. At the same time, evaluate reducing minimum lot width 
to allow developers to develop housing on lots as small as 3,500 square feet. If 
minimum lot sizes are decreased, increase the maximum density allowed from 6 
dwelling units per acre (7,250 square foot minimum lot size) to 8.7 dwelling units 
per acre (for 5,000 square foot minimum lot sizes) or 12.4 dwelling units per acre 
(for 3,500 square foot minimum lot sizes). 
Action 1.2.b: Evaluate removing the maximum density standard and allowing the 
building height limitation, lot coverage standard, and parking requirement to 
limit density in the RM-20 zone. As an alternative, the City could evaluate 
increasing the maximum density in the Multifamily Family Residential (RM-20) 
zone from 32 dwelling units per acre to 40 or more units per acre. 
Action 1.2.c: Evaluate other lot characteristic standards, such as setback 
requirements, to identify and remove barriers to the development of the wider 
range of housing discussed in Policy 2. 
Action 1.2.d: Evaluate requirements for including planting strips with new 
sidewalks and roads. There may be places where planting strips are not 
necessary, such as quiet residential neighborhoods. Removing the requirement 
for planning strips can increase density and lower development costs, where 
appropriate. 
Objective 1.3: Continue to coordinate land use planning with the Capital Improvement Plan to 
ensure that infrastructure is available to support residential development. 
Action 1.3.a: Identify areas of high priority for improving infrastructure to support 
new residential development, focusing on opportunities for new multifamily 
development in areas zoned RM-10 or RM-20. 
Action 1.3.b: Ensure that the City’s Capital Improvement Plan includes funding for 
improvements and maintenance necessary to support residential development. 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
Objective 1.4: Monitor residential land development to ensure that there is enough residential 
land to accommodate the long-term forecast for population growth. 
Action 1.4.a: Develop and implement a system to monitor the supply of residential 
land every two years. This includes monitoring residential development 
(through permits) as well as land consumption (e.g., development on vacant or 
redevelopable lands). 
Action 1.4.b: Reevaluate Silverton’s housing needs and land sufficiency every eight 
years, as required by House Bill 2003.  
Policy 2: Provide opportunities for housing development to meet the City’s identified 
housing needs. Provide opportunities for the development of a range of housing types that are 
affordable to households at all income levels, as described in the Silverton Housing Needs 
Analysis. These housing types include (but are not limited to) single-family detached housing, 
accessory dwellings, cottage housing, manufactured housing, townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, 
quadplexes, and multifamily products (including apartments). 
Objective 2.1: Modify the City’s Development Code to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of House Bill (HB) 2001, prior to June 30, 2021. Silverton is required to “allow the 
development of a duplex on each lot or parcel zoned for residential use that allows for the 
development of detached single-family dwellings.” 
Action 2.1.a: Revise Silverton’s Development Code to allow duplexes where single-
family dwellings are allowed in the following zones: R-1, R-5, RM-10, and RM-
20. Currently, the R-1 allows duplexes on lots with the same size standards as 
single-family detached units. The lot size standards are different in the R-5, RM-
10, and RM-20 for duplexes and single-family detached units. 
Objective 2.2: Allow for and encourage a wider range of housing development types within 
Silverton to meet the housing needs of all income levels in both existing neighborhoods and 
new residential areas. 
Action 2.2.a: In addition to the R-1 zone, allow single-room occupancies (SROs) in 
Silverton’s R-5, RM-10, and RM-20 zones, which would allow for the 
development or conversion of structures with multiple bedrooms and shared 
common spaces (i.e., shared kitchens and bathrooms), with the intention of 
allowing more than six unrelated persons to live in the same unit. Allowing more 
than six unrelated persons to live in the same unit would require redefining 
“household living” in the code. 
Action 2.2.b: Evaluate allowing triplexes and quadplexes in single-family zones, 
possibly using a form-based code approach to regulate the development of these 
units (Action 2.3.b). 
Action 2.2.c: Evaluate allowing courtyard apartments in the R-1 zone, with a goal of 
having these units rent at price points consistent with the rental rates published 
by the Marion County Housing Authority.  
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
Action 2.2.d: Evaluate allowing cottages in clusters with shared central amenities 
(such as open spaces) to allow for the development of small single-family 
detached housing clustered on a lot in the R-1, R-5, RM-10, and RM-20 zones. 
Action 2.2.e: Evaluate allowing tiny houses (typically units smaller than 500 square 
feet) in clusters with shared central amenities (such as open spaces) to allow for 
the development of small single-family detached housing clustered on a lot, 
possibly using a form-based code approach to regulate the development of these 
units (Action 2.3.b). 
Action 2.2.f: Evaluate removing the standard that a manufactured home must be 
multi-sectional and have an enclosed floor area of at least 1,000 square feet.  
Objective 2.3: Review development standards to allow for the development of a wider range of 
housing types, as discussed in Objective 2.2. 
Action 2.3.a: Conduct a broader audit of Silverton’s zoning code and development 
processes to identify barriers to residential development and identify alternatives 
for lowering or eliminating the barriers. 
Action 2.3.b: Evaluate developing a form-based code approach to regulate the 
development of small apartments, cottages, tiny houses, and desired multifamily 
housing types in the R-1 and R-5 zones. 
Action 2.3.c: Evaluate changing development standards for accessory dwelling units, 
including 1) removing the owner-occupied standard; 2) changing the size limit 
from 40% to 60% of the primary structure, but retaining the 800 square foot 
maximum size limit; and 3) allowing tiny homes as ADUs. 
Action 2.3.d: Evaluate reductions to off-street parking requirements for multifamily 
housing, including for affordable housing serving seniors and other populations 
that may have lower car ownership. Consider requiring off-street parking but not 
parking garages. Also consider allowing on-street parking within a certain 
distance of a development to count for a specific number or percentage of off-
street parking required for that development. 
Action 2.3.e: Identify opportunities to streamline the process and standards for 
planned developments to make their development easier and less costly.  
Action 2.3.f: Evaluate incentives to encourage developers to build planned 
developments with a variety of housing types, including incentives to support 
the development of income-restricted affordable housing. One incentive could be 
a reduction in the required amount of common open space if there were at least 
four housing types in the development that would be affordable at the time of 
development. Affordability might be defined as housing affordable for rentals at 
80% or less of the median family income ($55,500 in annual income or $1,400 in 
monthly rent) and affordable for homeownership at 120% or less of the median 
family income ($83,300 in annual income or a sales price of less than about 
$330,000). 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
Action 2.3.g: Evaluate allowing housing clusters on a parcel with constraints that 
prohibit or limit development, such as floodplains or wetlands. This would allow 
the unconstrained portion of the parcel to be developed at a higher density than 
the underlying zone, leaving the constrained portion of the parcel undeveloped. 
The City will need to develop clear criteria for allowing cluster development and 
may want to use a discretionary process for review of these development 
requests, as the request will vary based on the unique conditions of each parcel 
and constraints. 
Action 2.3.h: Conduct a Fair Housing audit of the City’s development processes and 
Development Code. An audit would look at existing definitions, restrictions, 
standards that trigger conditional use permits, and disparate impacts of policies 
on protected classes. The audit would produce objective information regarding 
compliance with the Fair Housing Act.  
Objective 2.4: Encourage the development of mixed-use multifamily housing in 
commercial zones. 
Action 2.4.a: Identify and lower barriers to mixed-use development that includes 
residential development in commercial zones (as part of Action 2.3.a). 
Action 2.4.b: Evaluate developing a policy and development standards to allow for 
the development of multifamily residential buildings in downtown. These 
buildings could be exclusively residential, or they may include a small amount of 
commercial space. The design standards for these buildings could include 
requirements that they look like other buildings in downtown.  
Action 2.4.c: Support redevelopment and mixed-use development within Silverton’s 
downtown to allow a mixture of higher-density housing and employment uses 
such as retail, office, and commercial services. The City may offer tools such as 
those discussed in Objective 3.2 to support this type of development. 
Action 2.4.d: Identify opportunities to rezone industrial land to commercial mixed-
use to support multifamily housing development, if the City has more industrial 
land than needed to accommodate growth over the next 20-years. 
Action 2.4.e: Evaluate developing a policy and development standards to allow 
live/work housing (buildings that include both housing and areas for work) in 
limited circumstances in industrial areas. A key issue in developing this policy is 
avoiding conflicts between residential uses and industrial uses.  
Policy 3. Provide opportunities for development of housing affordable to all income levels. 
Provide the opportunity to develop a broad range of accessible and affordable housing 
(affordable housing is defined as housing for which persons or families pay 30% or less of their 
gross income for housing, including necessary and essential utilities), focusing on housing 
development for very low–income and low-income affordable housing and middle-income 
affordable housing. Development of affordable housing should be encouraged in a variety of 
locations across the city.  
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
Objective 3.1: Support the development of income-restricted housing for households with 
very low and extremely low–incomes (households with an income of 60% or less of Marion 
County’s MFI or less than $41,600 for a family of four) through partnering with nonprofit, 
for-profit, and governmental developers of low-income affordable housing. 
Action 3.1.a: Support the development of income-restricted low-income housing by 
using the policies described in Objective 3.3.  
Action 3.1.b: Identify agencies and nonprofit organizations to form relationships 
with for supporting the development of income-restricted low-income housing. 
These agencies include (but are not limited to) Oregon Housing and Community 
Services, the Marion County Housing Authority, NeighborWorks, United Way, 
Habitat for Humanity, Community Development Partners, and other 
organizations. Work with the partners to support development proposals for 
new income-restricted housing in Silverton. 
Action 3.1.c: Identify surplus publicly owned properties that could be used for 
affordable housing, such as the Westfield property owned by the City. Identify 
the infrastructure deficiencies and costs of addressing the deficiencies that are 
necessary to allow the development of the properties. Partner with the 
developer(s) of low-income housing to develop affordable housing affordable to 
households earning less than 60% of MFI. 
o Note: With this and several other of the policies, the City may want to 
require that units be affordable to households earning less than 60% of 
MFI over a period of time. If the City puts in a lot of subsidy (e.g., the 
tools discussed in Objective 3.3), it may be appropriate to require that 
affordability is maintained over a 50-year period (as the Task Force has 
discussed). But for less subsidy, it would be more reasonable to require 
affordability over a five to ten-year period. 
Action 3.1.d: Be aware of financial tools used by income-restricted housing 
developers such as Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, federal funds (e.g., the 
Community Development Block Grant or the HOME Investments Partnership 
Program), or local income weatherization programs. City staff can work with 
staff at Oregon Housing and Community Services to better understand the use of 
these programs. 
Objective 3.2: Support the development of market-rate housing for households with low 
and middle incomes (households with an income between 60% and 120% of MFI for 
Marion County or $41,600 to $77,900 for a family of four). 
Action 3.2.a: Support the development of affordable market-rate housing by using 
the policies described in Objective 3.3.  
Objective 3.3: Support the development of all types of affordable housing, market-rate or 
income-restricted affordable housing, using tools that lower development or operational 
costs or make the development process simpler or faster. 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
o Note: One example affordable housing development is the proposal by 
the Silverton Affordable Housing Chat Group, which wants to develop a 
project with 10–12 small homes between 300 and 700 square feet for low-
income seniors. 
o Note: Below are tools typically used to support housing development. 
The City will need to develop criteria for using most of the tools below, 
such as the level of affordability (i.e., market-rate affordable housing or 
income-restricted affordable housing), the types of housing it applies to, 
the location or zones where the tool can be used, and other criteria 
necessary to implement the tool 
o Note: The City recently adopted the Low-Income Rental Housing tax 
exemption. This is a key tool that the City can use to help support the 
development of income-restricted affordable housing. 
Action 3.3.a: Evaluate providing a density bonus for the development of affordable 
housing, either market-rate or income-restricted affordable housing. The density 
bonus would allow development at higher densities than those allowed under 
existing zoning. A density bonus could also be used to encourage infill 
development, in addition to affordable housing. The City can offer the density 
bonus on a case-by-case basis.  
Action 3.3.b: Evaluate opportunities to reduce system development charges (SDCs) 
to support the development of affordable housing.3 Approaches include (1) 
developing a sliding-scale of SDCs based on the size of the units, charging lower 
SDCs for smaller units; (2) reducing or waiving SDCs for residential 
developments that meet Silverton’s housing needs or goals (such as the 
development of housing affordable to households earning less than 60% of MFI); 
(3) implementing an SDC financing credit program to incentivize needed 
housing types; (4) vesting SDC rates on submission of the complete land use 
review application to determine the SDCs early in the development process; and 
(5) collecting SDCs at completion of construction (prior to issuance of a certificate 
of occupancy) rather than at issuance of the building permit.  
 
The City would need to work with a consultant to identify the fiscal impact of 
these approaches and to determine which, if any, of these approaches are 
appropriate for Silverton. A way to fill the funding gap created by the 
reductions/waivers should be identified. A Construction Excise Tax (Action 
4.1.b) provides an opportunity to pay for the costs of reducing SDC costs for 
development of income-restricted housing.  
o Note: Newport, Oregon, provides an example of a sliding scale SDC. 
Newport calculates the SDC for single-family units based on the size of 
the unit. For example, the water SDC is charged as follows: the first 1,700 
                                                     
 
3 The City does not charge SDCs for accessory dwelling units (ADUs) that are attached to the primary house. 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
square feet of the dwelling unit has a water SDC of $0.62 per square foot, 
with an additional $.50 per square foot for between 1,701 and 2,900 
square feet and $0.41 per square foot for more than 2,900 square feet.  
Action 3.3.c: Identify opportunities to reduce development costs through changes to 
infrastructure development standards, while maintaining public health and 
safety standards. For example, allow the development of duplexes with a single 
sewer line or allow one water meter for multiple cottage units.  
Action 3.3.d: Evaluate partnering with an organization to establish or participate in a 
land bank or land trust.  
A land bank supports housing affordability by reducing or eliminating land or 
acquisition costs from a developer’s total development budget. Land banks take 
several forms, but many are administered by a nonprofit or government entity 
with a mission of managing a portfolio of properties to support a public or 
community purpose over many years or decades.  
A land trust is similar to land banking in that they participate in strategic land 
and property acquisition and restoration of the property (e.g., clear blight, clear 
title). Though instead of ultimately selling the property (land and buildings), the 
land trust holds the land in perpetuity and sells or leases the buildings. A land 
trust is typically a private or nonprofit organization that leases or sells the 
buildings (e.g., dwelling units) sited on the land but owns and manages the land 
permanently.  
The City’s role in a land bank or land trust may include:  
• 
Identifying opportunities to assist with the assembly of land into a single 
tax lot or multiple adjacent tax lots in certain cases (i.e., a mixed-use 
development with more than one developer involved) to support the 
development of affordable housing. 
• 
Identifying surplus publicly owned properties that could be used for 
affordable housing and partner with developers of affordable housing 
(consistent with Actions 3.1 and 3.2). 
Objective 3.4: Develop the Silverton Housing Program, which would be a comprehensive 
housing strategy that supports the development of both income-restricted affordable 
housing and naturally occurring affordable housing. The Silverton Housing Program will 
be a program that uses a variety of tools, such as those described in this memorandum, to 
lower barriers and encourage affordable housing development. 
Policy 4. Identify funding sources to support the development of infrastructure and housing 
affordability programs. Develop funding sources to pay for the costs of implementing the 
affordable housing programs described in Policy 3 and infrastructure improvements in Policy 1.  
Objective 4.1: Identify funding sources to pay for the affordable housing programs and 
infrastructure development actions in this strategy.  
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
o Note: Below are funding tools typically used to support housing 
development. Some of these should be used only for the development of 
housing affordable at 60% or less of MFI and some may be appropriate 
for market-rate multifamily housing  
Action 4.1.a: Evaluate expanding the existing Urban Renewal district or adding a 
new district, with the purpose of supporting the development of market-rate and 
income-restricted affordable housing. The Urban Renewal district can support 
the development of infrastructure necessary to support housing development, as 
well as supporting the development of affordable housing.  
Tax increment finance revenues (TIFs) are generated by the increase in total 
assessed value in an urban renewal district from the time the district is first 
established. As property values increase in the district, the increase in total 
property taxes (i.e., City, County, school portions) is used to pay off the bonds. 
When the bonds are paid off, the entire valuation is returned to the general 
property tax rolls. TIFs defer property tax accumulation by the City and County 
until the urban renewal district expires or pays off the bonds. Over the long term 
(most districts are established for a period of twenty or more years), the district 
could produce significant revenues for capital projects. Urban renewal funds can 
be invested in the form of low-interest loans and/or grants for a variety of capital 
investments:

The City could consider including urban renewal projects that support the 
development of multifamily housing affordable for households earning less than 
60% of MFI ($41,600 for a household of four). Cities primarily use urban renewal 
funds to support the development of affordable housing by purchasing land and 
accepting development proposals on that land. Cities typically require some 
percentage of housing to be affordable, or they make the inclusion of affordable 
housing a criterion for the evaluation of development proposals.  
Action 4.1.b: Evaluate the implementation of a construction excise tax (CET). As part 
of the evaluation, conduct an analysis about the benefits and drawbacks of a CET 
for Silverton, including potential fiscal impacts of a CET for the City.  
A CET is a tax assessed on construction permits issued by local cities and 
counties. The tax is assessed as a percent of the value of the improvements for 
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
which a permit is sought, unless the project is exempted from the tax. CETs may 
be residential only, commercial only, or residential and commercial. If the City 
were to adopt a CET, the tax would be up to 1% of the permit value on 
residential construction and an uncapped rate on commercial and industrial 
construction.  
At the initial discussions of a CET with the public, at the December public 
meeting, a majority of participants indicated that they thought a CET was a low-
priority action. Analysis of a CET and additional public discussions may result in 
a different assessment of the potential for using a CET to fund programs that 
support the development of housing affordable to all income levels.  
Action 4.1.c: Evaluate other sources of revenues for funding affordable housing 
development, general obligation bonds, Bancroft bonds (for infrastructure 
projects), or marijuana taxes.

Existing Comprehensive Plan Policies 
Goal 
Meet the projected housing needs of citizens in the Silverton Area 
Objectives 
1. Encourage a "small town" environment. 
2. Encourage preservation, maintenance, and improvement of the existing housing stock 
3. Encourage new housing in suitable areas to minimize public facility and service costs 
and preserve agricultural land. 
4. Encourage an adequate supply of housing types necessary to meet the needs of different 
family sizes and incomes. 
Policies 
1. Protect adjacent residential areas from encroachment of new non-residential 
developments through the use of screening, buffering, landscaping, and building 
setbacks and compliance with other provisions within the City’s Design Review 
Ordinance. Properties with existing developments which meet the criteria for the zone 
which they are in are determined to be compatible with adjacent residential uses.  
2. Promote rehabilitation of older homes through use of available loan and grant 
programs.  
3. Provide an adequate inventory of land zoned for manufactured home park and multi 
family dwelling sites within the City.  
4. Encourage planned unit development, mixed use housing, and mixed housing with 
commercial uses as a means for broadening housing choices and creating sustainable 
neighborhoods.  
5. Encourage opportunities which will provide affordable housing to meet the needs of 
low income, elderly, handicapped, families, and individuals within the Silverton area.  
6. Provide opportunities for the development of attached and detached single-family and 
multi-family dwellings such as duplexes, row houses, town house apartments.  
7. Allow accessory dwelling units, subject to city development and building regulations, in 
all residential zones.  
8. Allow for, and encourage the use of, flexible lot sizes and building placement, and 
density transfers to reduce development costs, make efficient use of land, and promote 
housing variety and affordability.  
9. Adhere to clear and objective standards for approval of residential development to 
ensure a timely and predictable development review process.  
10. Encourage new housing units to adhere to the following design elements:  
ECONorthwest  
Silverton: Housing Policies and Actions 
• 
Locate garages behind the primary building line of the house, side-loading garages, 
or garages in the rear with alley access;  
• 
Provision for front porches;  
• 
Primary orientation toward the street and sidewalk;  
• 
Provisions for street trees.  
11. Require design review approval for all multifamily developments and manufactured 
home parks.  
12. Encourage the use of sustainable development practices in residential site planning, 
building materials, and environmental control systems, including use of active and 
passive solar energy, energy efficient designs, and low water use landscaping.  
Implementation 
1. The existing zoning and subdivision ordinances will be revised periodically so that they 
serve as better tools for implementing housing policies.  
2. The City will work with the Marion County Housing Authority, private non-profit 
organizations, and for-profit entities to secure funds for housing rehabilitation in 
Silverton.  
3. The City will work with the Marion County Housing Authority, private non-profit 
organizations, and for-profit entities to continue to provide for needs of low-income 
people living in the Silverton area. In particular, the City will work closely with Section 
202 housing project sponsors to increase Silverton’s supply of affordable rental housing 
for low income residents.

Appendix A. Housing Policy Alternatives 
This appendix provides the City with information about potential policies that could be 
implemented in Silverton to address the City’s housing needs. Implementing some of the 
strategies in this appendix may be beyond Silverton’s current staff or financial resources.  
This appendix provides a range of housing policy options for the City of Silverton to consider as 
it addresses its housing needs. These policy options are commonly used by cities in Oregon and 
other states. Policy options are categorized as follows: 
 
Land Use Regulations 
 
Increase Housing Types 
 
Financial Assistance to Homeowners and Renters 
 
Lower Development or Operational Costs 
 
Funding Sources to Support Residential Development 
The intention of this appendix is to provide a toolbox of potential policies and actions that the 
City can use to address strategic issues. For many of the policy tools described below, we give 
an approximate scale of impact. The purpose of the scale of impact is to provide some context 
for whether the policy tool generally results in a little or a lot of change in the housing 
market. The scale of impact depends on conditions in the City, such as other the City’s other 
existing (or newly implemented) housing policies, the land supply, and housing market 
conditions. We define the scale of impact as follows: 
 
A small impact may not directly result in development of new housing or it may result 
in development of a small amount of new housing, such as 1% to 3% of the needed 
housing. In terms of housing affordability, a small impact may not improve housing 
affordability in and of itself. A policy with a small impact may be necessary but not 
sufficient to increase housing affordability.  
 
 A moderate impact is likely to directly result in development of new housing, such as 
3% to 5% of needed housing. In terms of housing affordability, a moderate impact may 
not improve housing affordability in and of itself. A policy with a moderate impact may 
be necessary but not sufficient to increase housing affordability. 
 
A large impact is likely to directly result in development of new housing, such as 5% to 
10% (or more) of needed housing. In terms of housing affordability, a large impact may 
improve housing affordability in and of itself. A policy with a large impact may still 
need to work with other policies to increase housing affordability.

Land Use Regulations 
The following policies focus on ways in which the City can modify its current land use regulations in order to increase housing 
affordability and available housing stock. Policies are broken into two categories: those that affect regulatory changes, and those which 
increase the land available for housing.

Regulatory Changes 
Administrative 
and Procedural 
Reforms 
Regulatory delay can be a major cost-inducing factor in development. Oregon 
has specific requirements for review of development applications. However, 
complicated projects frequently require additional analysis such as traffic impact 
studies, etc. 
A key consideration in these types of reforms is how to streamline the review 
process and still achieve the intended objectives of local development policies. 
Scale of Impact - Small. The 
level of impact on production of 
housing and housing 
affordability will be small and will 
depend on the changes made to 
the city’s procedures. 
Streamlining procedures may be 
necessary but not sufficient to 
increase housing production on 
its own. 
Expedited / 
Fast-tracked 
Building Permit 
Expedite building permits for pre-approved development types or building 
characteristics (e.g. green buildings). 
City of Bend offers expedited review and permitting for affordable housing. Any 
residential or mixed-use development that receives local, state or federal 
affordable housing funding is eligible to receive a written decision by the 
Planning Department within two weeks of the date of submittal. For projects that 
require more complex planning review, a decision will be written, or the first 
public hearing will be held within six weeks of the date of submittal.  
Scale of Impact - Small. 
Expedited permit processing will 
benefit a limited number of 
projects. It may be necessary 
but not sufficient to increase 
housing production on its own.

Streamline 
Zoning Code 
and other 
Ordinances 
Complexity of zoning, subdivision, and other ordinances can make development 
more difficult, time consuming, and costly. Streamlining development 
regulations can result in increased development.  
As part of the streamlining process, cities may evaluate potential barriers to 
affordable workforce housing and multifamily housing. Potential barriers may 
include height limitations, complexity of planned unit development regulations, 
parking requirements, and other zoning standards. 
Many of the remaining tools in this section focus on changes to the zoning code. 
Scale of Impact - Small to 
moderate. The level of impact 
on production of housing and 
housing affordability will depend 
on the changes made to the 
zoning code and other 
ordinances. 
Allow Small 
Residential Lots 
Small residential lots are generally less than 5,000 sq. ft and sometimes closer 
to 2,000 sq. ft. This policy allows individual small lots within a subdivision. Small 
lots can be allowed outright in the minimum lot size and dimensions of a zone, 
or they could be implemented through the subdivision or planned unit 
development ordinances. 
This policy is intended to increase density and lower housing costs. Small-lots 
limit sprawl, contribute to a more efficient use of land, and promote densities 
that can support transit. Small lots also provide expanded housing ownership 
opportunities to broader income ranges and provide additional variety to 
available housing types. 
Cities across Oregon allow small residential lots, including many cities in the 
Metro area.  
Scale of Impact – Small to 
moderate. Cities have adopted 
minimum lot sizes as small as 
2,000 sq. ft. However, it is 
uncommon to see entire 
subdivisions of lots this small. 
Small lots typically get mixed in 
with other lot sizes. This tool 
generally increases density and 
amount of single-family 
detached and townhouse 
housing in a given area, 
decreasing housing costs as a 
result of decreasing amount of 
land on the lot.

Strategy Name 
Description 
Scale of Impact  
Mandate 
Maximum Lot 
Sizes  
This policy places an upper bound on lot size and a lower bound on density in 
single-family zones. For example, a residential zone with a 6,000 sq. ft. 
minimum lot size might have an 8,000 sq. ft. maximum lot size yielding an 
effective net density range between 5.4 and 7.3 dwelling units per net acre. 
This approach ensures minimum densities in residential zones by limiting lot 
size. It places bounds on building at less than maximum allowable density. 
Maximum lot sizes can promote appropriate urban densities, efficiently use 
limited land resources, and reduce sprawl development. 
This tool is used by some cities but is used less frequently than mandating 
minimum lot sizes. 
Scale of Impact—Small to 
moderate. Mandating maximum 
lot size may be most appropriate 
in areas where the market is 
building at substantially lower 
densities than are allowed or in 
cities that do not have minimum 
densities. 
This tool generally increases 
density and amount of single-
family detached and townhouse 
housing in a given area, 
decreasing housing costs as a 
result of decreasing amount of 
land on the lot. 
Mandate 
Minimum 
Residential 
Densities 
This policy is typically applied in single-family residential zones and places a 
lower bound on density. Minimum residential densities in single-family zones are 
typically implemented through maximum lot sizes. In multifamily zones, they are 
usually expressed as a minimum number of dwelling units per net acre. Such 
standards are typically implemented through zoning code provisions in 
applicable residential zones. 
This policy increases land-holding capacity. Minimum densities promote 
developments consistent with local comprehensive plans and growth 
assumptions. They reduce sprawl development, eliminate underbuilding in 
residential areas, and make provision of services more cost effective. 
Mandating minimum density is generally most effective in medium and high-
density zones where single-family detached housing is allowed. The minimum 
density ensures that low-density single-family housing is not built where higher-
density multifamily housing could be built. 
Scale of Impact—Small to 
moderate. Increasing minimum 
densities and ensuring clear 
urban conversion plans may 
have a small to moderate impact 
depending on the observed 
amount of under-build and the 
minimum density standard. 
For cities that allow single-family 
detached housing in high 
density zones, this policy can 
result in a moderate or larger 
impact.

Increase 
Allowable 
Residential 
Densities  
This approach seeks to increase holding capacity by increasing allowable 
density in residential zones. It gives developers the option of building to higher 
densities. This approach would be implemented through the local zoning or 
development code. This strategy is most commonly applied to multifamily 
residential zones. 
For cities with maximum densities, consider removing maximum allowable 
densities. This change may be most relevant. 
Higher densities increase residential landholding capacity. Higher densities, 
where appropriate, provide more housing, a greater variety of housing options, 
and a more efficient use of scarce land resources. Higher densities also reduce 
sprawl development and make the provision of services more cost effective. 
Scale of Impact—Small to 
moderate. This tool can be 
most effective in increasing 
densities where very low density 
is currently allowed or in areas 
where a city wants to encourage 
higher density development. 
This tool generally increases 
density and amount of single-
family detached and townhouse 
housing in a given area, 
decreasing housing costs as a 
result of decreasing amount of 
land on the lot. 
Allow Clustered 
Residential 
Development 
Clustering allows developers to increase density on portions of a site, while 
preserving other areas of the site. Clustering is a tool most commonly used to 
preserve natural areas or avoid natural hazards during development. It uses 
characteristics of the site as a primary consideration in determining building 
footprints, access, etc. Clustering is typically processed during the site review 
phase of development review. 
Scale of Impact—Moderate. 
Clustering can increase density, 
however, if other areas of the 
site that could otherwise be 
developed are not developed, 
the scale of impact can be 
reduced.

Reduced 
Parking 
Requirements 
Jurisdictions can reduce or eliminate minimum off-street parking requirements, 
as well as provide flexibility in meeting parking requirements. Reducing parking 
requirements positively impact development of any type of housing, from single-
family detached to multifamily housing.  
Reduced parking requirements are most frequently used in conjunction of 
development of subsidized affordable housing, but cities like Portland have 
reduced or eliminated parking requirements for market-based multifamily 
housing in specific circumstances. 
City of Bend offers parking reductions for affordable housing and transit 
proximity. Parking for affordable housing units is 1 space per unit regardless of 
size, compared to 1 space per studio or 1-bedroom unit, 1.5 spaces per 2-
bedroom unit, and 2 spaces per 3- or more bedroom unit for market-rate 
multifamily development or 2 spaces per market rate detached dwelling unit. 
Affordable housing units must meet the same eligibility criteria as for other City 
of Bend affordable housing incentives  
City of Portland offers parking exceptions for affordable housing and sites 
adjacent to transit. The City of Portland allows housing developments that meet 
the inclusionary zoning requirements to reduce parking requirements to zero if 
located near frequent transit service, and to exclude the affordable housing units 
from parking requirements for developments located further from frequent transit 
service. The City also allows market rate housing developments located near 
frequent transit service to provide little or no parking, depending on the number 
of units in the development. 
Scale of Impact—Small to 
moderate.  
The City could require the 
developer to prove the need and 
public benefit or reducing 
parking requirements to 
increase housing affordability. 
Reducing parking requirements 
can have a moderate to large 
impact on housing affordability if 
little or no parking is required. 
Reduce Street 
Width 
Standards 
This policy is intended to reduce land used for streets and slow down traffic. 
Street standards are typically described in development and/or subdivision 
ordinances. Reduced street width standards are most commonly applied on 
local streets in residential zones. This strategy could be applied to alleys, when 
required, to ensure that alleys are relatively narrow to reduce development and 
maintenance costs. 
Narrower streets make more land available to housing and economic-based 
development. Narrower streets can also reduce long-term street maintenance 
costs.  
Scale of Impact—Small. This 
policy is most effective in cities 
that require relatively wide 
streets.

Preserving 
Existing 
Housing Supply 
Housing preservation ordinances typically condition the demolition or 
replacement of certain housing types on the replacement of such housing 
elsewhere, fees in lieu of replacement, or payment for relocation expenses of 
existing tenants. Preservation of existing housing may focus on preservation of 
smaller, more affordable housing. Approaches include: 
• 
Housing preservation ordinances 
• 
Housing replacement ordinances 
• 
Manufactured home preservation 
• 
Single-room-occupancy ordinances 
• 
Regulating demolitions 
Scale of Impact—Small to 
moderate. Preserving small 
existing housing can make a 
difference in the availability of 
affordable housing in a city but it 
is limited by the existing stock 
housing, especially smaller, 
more affordable housing. Cities 
with older housing stock are 
more likely to benefit from this 
policy. 
Inclusionary 
Zoning 
Inclusionary zoning policies tie development approval to, or provide regulatory 
incentives for, the provision of low- and moderate-income housing as part of a 
proposed development. Mandatory inclusionary zoning requires developers to 
provide a certain percentage of low-income housing. Incentive-based 
inclusionary zoning provides density or other types of incentives. 
The price of low-income housing passed on to purchasers of market-rate 
housing. Inclusionary zoning impedes the "filtering" process where residents 
purchase new housing, freeing existing housing for lower-income residents. 
Oregon’s inclusionary zoning laws apply to structures with 20 or more 
multifamily units, with inclusion of units that are affordable at 80% of the median 
family income of the city. 
The City of Portland has implemented an inclusionary zoning program. While 
Portland’s inclusionary zoning program is resulting in production of affordable 
multifamily units, there is considerable discussion and disagreement about the 
impact of number of multifamily units being built and potential changes in the 
location of units.  
Scale of Impact—Small to 
moderate. Inclusionary zoning 
has recently been made legal in 
Oregon. The scale of impact 
would depend on the 
inclusionary zoning policies 
adopted by the city.

Re-designate or 
rezone land for 
housing 
The types of land rezoned for housing are vacant or partially vacant low-density 
residential and employment land rezoned to multifamily or mixed use. In 
rezoning land, it is important to choose land in a compatible location, such as 
land that can be a buffer between an established neighborhood and other 
denser uses or land adjacent to existing commercial uses. When rezoning 
employment land, it is best to select land with limited employment capacity (i.e., 
smaller parcels) in areas where multifamily housing would be compatible (i.e., 
along transit corridors or in employment centers that would benefit from new 
housing). 
This policy change increases opportunity for comparatively affordable 
multifamily housing and provides opportunities for mixing residential and other 
compatible uses. 
Cities across Oregon frequently re-zone and re-designate land to address 
deficits of land for new housing.  
Scale of Impact - Small to 
large. Scale of impact depends 
on the amount and location of 
land rezoned and the densities 
allowed on the rezoned land. 
 
Encourage 
multifamily 
residential 
development in 
commercial 
zones 
This tool seeks to encourage denser multifamily housing as part of mixed-use 
projects in commercial zones. Such policies lower or eliminate barriers to 
residential development in commercial or mixed-use zones. They include 
eliminating requirements for non-residential uses in commercial zones (e.g., 
requirements for ground floor retail) or requiring minimum residential densities. 
This policy can increase opportunities for multifamily development on 
commercial or mixed-use zones or increase the density of that development. 
Cities across Oregon frequently encourage multifamily housing development in 
commercial zones, either as stand-along residential buildings or as mixed-use 
buildings. 
Scale of Impact – Small to 
moderate. Many cities already 
encourage multifamily housing 
in commercial zones. Further 
encouraging multifamily housing 
in commercial zones would 
likely have a small impact, as 
multifamily housing is allowed in 
many of the commercial areas 
where it would be desirable. 
Unless it is publicly subsidized, 
mixed-use development 
generally results in relatively 
costly housing because ground 
floor commercial development is 
relatively expensive.

Transfer or 
Purchase of 
Development 
Rights 
This policy is intended to move development from sensitive areas to more 
appropriate areas. Development rights are transferred to “receiving zones” and 
can be traded and can increase overall densities. This policy is usually 
implemented through a subsection of the zoning code and identifies both 
sending zones (zones where decreased densities are desirable) and receiving 
zones (zones where increased densities are allowed). 
Transfer of development rights is done less frequently in Oregon, as cities 
generally zone land for higher density housing where they would like it to occur. 
This policy is frequently used by cities outside of Oregon.  
Scale of Impact - Small to 
moderate. Actual impact will 
depend on the extent to which 
the policy is used. TDRs may 
have little impact on overall 
densities since overall density is 
not changed; rather it is moved 
around. TDRs can be used to 
encourage higher densities in 
selected areas. 
Provide Density 
Bonuses to 
Developers 
The local government allows developers to build housing at densities higher 
than are usually allowed by the underlying zoning. Density bonuses are 
commonly used as a tool to encourage greater housing density in desired areas, 
provided certain requirements are met. This strategy is generally implemented 
through provisions of the local zoning code and is allowed in appropriate 
residential zones. 
Bonus densities can also be used to encourage development of low-income or 
workforce affordable housing. An affordable housing bonus would allow for 
more housing units to be built than allowed by zoning if the proposed project 
provides a certain number of affordable units. 
City of Bend offers affordable housing density and height bonuses. Qualifying 
affordable housing projects are eligible for a 10-foot building height bonus for 
multifamily housing when affordable housing units are gained and for a density 
bonus. The density increase is based on the percentage of affordable housing 
units within the proposed development: if 10% of the units are affordable, the 
maximum density is 110% of the standard maximum density. The maximum 
density bonus is 50% above the base density. Qualifying projects must be 
affordable to households at or below 60% of the AMI for rental housing and at or 
below 80% of the AMI for ownership housing and require development 
agreements and restrictions to ensure continued affordability.  
Ashland has four different density bonuses, one of which is for development of 
affordable housing at higher densities and another for energy-efficient housing.

Allow small or 
“tiny” homes 
“Tiny” homes are typically dwellings that are 500 square feet or smaller. 
Some tiny houses are as small as 100 to 150 square feet. They include 
stand-alone units or very small multifamily units. 
Tiny homes can be sited in a variety of ways: locating them in RV parks 
(they are similar in many respects to Park Model RVs), tiny home 
subdivisions, or allowing them as accessory dwelling units. 
Smaller homes allow for smaller lots, increasing land use efficiency. They 
provide opportunities for affordable housing, especially for homeowners. 
Portland and Eugene allow tiny homes as temporary shelter for people 
experiencing homelessness. 
Scale of Impact - Small: Scale of 
impact depends on regulation of 
tiny homes, where they are

Parcel assembly 
Parcel assembly involves the city’s ability to purchase lands for the purpose of 
land aggregation or site assembly. It can directly address the issues related to 
limited multifamily lands being available in appropriate locations (e.g., near 
arterials and commercial services). Typical goals of parcel assembly programs 
are: (1) to provide sites for rental apartments in appropriate locations close to 
services and (2) to reduce the cost of developing multifamily rental units 
Parcel assembly can lower the cost of multifamily development because the 
City is able to purchase land in strategic locations over time. Parcel assembly is 
often associated with development of affordable housing (affordable to 
households with income below 60% of MFI), where the City partners with 
nonprofit affordable housing developers. 
Parcel assembly can be critically important role for cities to kick start quality 
affordable housing and work force housing projects that can be positive 
catalysts too for market rate development.  
Scale of Impact - Small to

Land Banking 
Land banks support housing development by reducing or eliminating land cost 
from development, with the goal of increasing the affordability of housing. They 
can take several forms. Many are administered by a non-profit or non-
governmental entity with a mission of managing a portfolio of properties to 
support affordable housing development over many years or decades. Ideally, a 
land bank is set up to manage financial and administrative resources, including 
strategic property disposal, for the explicit purpose of supporting affordable 
housing development. Cities can partner with non-profits or sometimes manage 
their own land banks. Cities may also donate, sell, or lease publicly owned land 
for the development of affordable housing even without a formal ‘land bank’ 
organization.  
Land banks are purposed for short-term ownership of lands. Lands acquired 
are often vacant, blighted, or environmentally contaminated. Land banks may 
also acquire lands with title defects or of which derelict structures sit. Lands are 
eventually transferred to a new owner for reuse and redevelopment. 
Scale of Impact - Small to 
large. A land bank will have the 
biggest impact on production of 
low- and moderate-income 
affordable housing. Considering 
how difficult it is to build this type 
of affordable housing and the 
level of need for affordable 
housing, a land trust could 
increase nonprofits’ capacity to 
build affordable housing. 
Land Trusts 
A land trust is typically a nonprofit organization that owns land and sells or 
leases the housing on the land to income-qualified buyers. Because the land is 
not included in the housing price for tenants / buyers, land trusts can achieve 
below-market pricing. Land trusts are most commonly used as a method for 
supporting affordable home ownership goals.  
Land trusts are purposed for long-term stewardship of lands and buildings. 
Lands / buildings acquired may have need for remediation or redevelopment. 
Lands / buildings may have also been acquired to preserve affordability, prevent 
deferred maintenance, or protect against foreclosure 
Proud Ground (Portland Metro Area) was founded in 1999 and has grown into 
one of the largest community land trusts in the country. The organization 
focuses on affordable homeownership and controls ground leases associated 
with 270 homes in Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas, and Clark County.

Public Land 
Disposition 
The public sector sometimes controls land that has been acquired with 
resources that enable it to dispose of that land for private and/or nonprofit 
redevelopment. Land acquired with funding sources such as tax increment, EB-
5, or through federal resources such as CDBG or HUD Section 108 can be sold 
or leased at below market rates for various projects to help achieve

redevelopment objectives. This increases development feasibility by reducing 
development costs and gives the public sector leverage to achieve its goals via 
a development agreement process with the developer. Funding can come from 
Tax Increment, CDBG/HUD 108, or EB-5. 
Cities across Oregon use publicly land to support affordable and market-rate of 
housing development. In some cases, municipalities put surplus public land into 
land banks or land trusts. 
Tri-Met is evaluating re-use of construction staging sites for future affordable 
housing and/or transit-orient development sites. 
Cottage Grove is working with the school district to discuss and plan for use of 
surplus school district land for future housing development. 
Reduced / 
Waived Building 
Permit fee, 
Planning fees, or 
SDCs 
Programs that reduce various development fees as an incentive to induce 
qualifying types of development or building features. There are a number of 
avenues to seek reduced or waived fees. For example, stormwater 
improvements can be made through the Commercial Stormwater Fee 
Reduction. There are commonly used tools, often implemented in conjunction 
with development agreements or other development negotiation processes. 
City of Portland offers SDC exemptions for affordable housing. Portland’s SDC 
Exemption Program exempts developers of qualifying affordable housing 
projects from paying SDCs levied by the City of Portland for transportation, 
water, parks and environmental services. Eligible rental projects must serve 
households earning at or below 60% of the AMI for a 60-year period. Portland 
also offers SDC waivers for development of ADUs. 
City of McMinnville offers SDC exemptions and reduced permit fees for 
affordable housing. Building and planning permit fees for new or remodel 
housing construction projects are reduced by 50% for eligible projects and 
SDCs for transportation, wastewater and parks are exempted at 100%. 
Reductions/exemptions are prorated for mixed use or mixed-income 
developments. The property must be utilized for housing for low-income 
persons for at least 10 years or the SDCs must be paid to the city.  
Scale of Impact - Small. 
Scaling SDCs to 
Unit Size 
Cities often charge a set SDC per dwelling unit, charging the same SDCs for 
large single-family detached units as for small single-family detached units or 
accessory dwelling units. Some cities have started scaling SDC based on the

size of the unit in square feet. Offering lower SDC for smaller units can 
encourage development of smaller units, such as small single-family detached 
units or cottage cluster units. 
Newport Oregon scales SDCs for water, wastewater, stormwater, and 
transportation. The City has a base SDC rate (per square foot) of built space. 
For example, a 1,000 square foot unit would be charged $620 for water SDC 
($0.62 per square foot). A 2,000 square foot unit would be charged $1,204 for 
the water SDC ($0.62 per square foot for the first 1,700 square feet and $0.50 
for the additional 300 square feet). 
SDC Financing 
Credits 
May help to offset the an SDC charge, which is a one-time fee that is issued 
when there is new development or a change in use.  
SDC financing enables developers to stretch their SDC payment over time, 
thereby reducing upfront costs. Alternately, credits allow developers to make 
necessary improvements to the site in lieu of paying SDCs. Note that the City 
can control its own SDCs, but often small cities manage them on behalf of other 
jurisdictions including the County and special districts. SDCs are granted when 
the project makes lasting improvements, such as improving roads, reducing 
number of trips, create or improve parks or recreational centers, and 
permanently removing water services. 
Scale of Impact – Small to 
moderate. The City may 
consider changes in SDCs to 
allow financing, but the City 
would want to ensure that the 
impact should be spread-out 
and non-negatively impact one 
entity.  
Sole Source 
SDCs 
Retains SDCs paid by developers within a limited geographic area that directly 
benefits from new development, rather than being available for use city-wide. 
This enables SDC-eligible improvements within the area that generates those 
funds to keep them for these improvements. Improvements within smaller areas 
can enhance the catalytic and redevelopment value of the area. This tool can 
also be blended with other resources such as LIDs and Urban Renewal (Tax 
Increment Financing). Funding can come from an SDC fund or general fund. In 
some cases, there may be no financial impact. The housing can come in the 
form of student, low-income, or workforce housing.  
Scale of Impact – Small to

tool is implemented and whether 
it is used with other tools, such

Directs user fees into an enterprise fund that provides dedicated revenue to 
fund specific projects. Examples of those types of funds can include parking 
revenue funds, stormwater/sewer funds, street funds, etc. The City could also

“entitlement” into the shared supply. The shared supply could meet initial 
parking need when the development comes online while also maintaining the 
flexibility to adjust to parking need over time as elasticity in the demand patterns 
develop in the district and influences like alternative modes are accounted for. 
Funding can come from residents, businesses, and developers. Also, these 
fees or revenues allow for new revenue streams into the City. 
Reimbursement 
District 
A Reimbursement District is a cost sharing mechanism, typically Initiated by a 
developer. The purpose is to provide a reimbursement method to the developer 
of an infrastructure improvement, through fees paid by property owners at the 
time the property benefits from the improvement. A developer applies to create 
a Reimbursement District by demonstrating benefit to properties beyond their 
own. In addition, the size of the improvement must be measurably greater than 
would otherwise be ordinarily required for the improvement 
Eligible Reimbursement District projects typically include (but are not limited to) 
construction or connections of a sewer, water, storm water or street 
improvements. Applications typically include: a fee sufficient to cover the cost of 
administrative review, a description of the project, properties that would be 
impacted, and a detailed methodology and calculation of how the estimated 
costs would be reimbursed by payments from benefitted properties over a 
specified timeframe. A report from the City Engineer is generated in review of 
the submitted application. After a public hearing process, the council will 
approve, reject or modify the proposal. The approval of a Reimbursement 
District results in a resolution and distribution of notice among benefitted 
properties before construction can begin. 
Benefitted properties must pay the Reimbursement Fee when they make a 
physical connection to the improvement (or in the case of a sewer project, when 
the benefitted property creates an impervious surface that drains into the public 
sewer) within the Reimbursement District Area. Reimbursement fees are 
collected by the City and are distributed to the developer for the duration of the 
Reimbursement District, which are typically 10-15 years.  
Paid by benefitted properties at the time the property benefits from the 
improvement, typically at connection to the sewer, water or storm drain system.

The 2017 Legislature passed legislation moving the administration of Vertical 
Housing Program from Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) to 
the local City and County beginning Oct 6th, 2017. OHCS no longer administers 
this program.  
The legislation subsidizes "mixed-use" projects to encourage dense 
development or redevelopment by providing a partial property tax exemption on 
increased property value for qualified developments. The exemption varies in 
accordance with the number of residential floors on a mixed-use project with a 
maximum property tax exemption of 80 percent over 10 years. An additional 
property tax exemption on the land may be given if some or all of the residential 
housing is for low-income persons (80 percent of area is median income or 
below).

Through a competitive process, multi-unit projects can receive a property tax 
exemption for up to ten-years on structural improvements to the property. 
Though the state enables the program, each City has an opportunity to shape 
the program to achieve its goals by controlling the geography of where the 
exemption is available, application process and fees, program requirements, 
criteria (return on investment, sustainability, inclusion of community space, 
percentage affordable or workforce housing, etc.), and program cap. The City 
can select projects on a case-by-case basis through a competitive process.

number of units made available to low-income households, for up to 10 
consecutive years. The bill was crafted to strengthen the connection to 
affordability by requiring cities and counties to establish a schedule in which the 
number of years an exemption is provided increases directly with the 
percentage of units rented to households with an annual income at or below 
120 percent of MFI, and at monthly rates that are affordable to such 
households. While not specifically referenced in the measure, ORS 308.701 
defines “Multi-unit rental housing” as: “(a) residential property consisting of four 
or more dwelling units” and; “does not include assisted living facilities.” 
All new multifamily units that are built or renovated that offer rent below 120% of 
AMI are potentially eligible for this tax exemption. In a city with an AMI of 
$55,000 (common outside of Portland), that's rent of $1,650 per month or less. 
The tax exemption is for all taxing districts which is administered by the City. 
Due to this, smaller jurisdictions may have more trouble managing this program.

counties, etc. 
The City of Eugene offers a ten-year Multi-Unit Property Tax Exemption

Renewal / 
Tax 
Increment 
Finance (TIF) 
Tax increment finance revenues are generated by the increase in total assessed 
value in an urban renewal district from the time the district is first established. As 
property values increase in the district, the increase in total property taxes (i.e., 
City, County, school portions) is used to pay off the bonds. When the bonds are 
paid off, the entire valuation is returned to the general property tax rolls. TIFs defer 
property tax accumulation by the City and County until the urban renewal district 
expires or pays off bonds. Over the long term (most districts are established for a 
period of 20 or more years), the district could produce significant revenues for 
capital projects. Urban renewal funds can be invested in the form of low-interest 
loans and/or grants for a variety of capital investments:  
• 
Redevelopment projects, such as mixed-use or infill housing developments 
• 
Economic development strategies, such as capital improvement loans for 
small or startup businesses which can be linked to family-wage jobs

Construction 
Excise Tax 
(CET) 
Funds land use planning throughout the region by taxing construction permits. 
CET is a tax assessed on construction permits issued by local cities and counties. 
The tax is assessed as a percent of the value of the improvements for which a 
permit is sought, unless the project is exempted from the tax. In 2016, the Oregon 
Legislature passed Senate Bill 1533 which permits cities to adopt a construction 
excise tax (CET) on the value of new construction projects to raise funds for 
affordable housing projects. CETs may be residential only, commercial only, or 
residential and commercial. If the City were to adopt a CET, the tax would be up to 
1% of the permit value on residential construction and an uncapped rate on 
commercial and industrial construction. The allowed uses for CET funding are 
defined by the state statute. The City may retain 4% of funds to cover 
administrative costs. The funds remaining must be allocated as follows, if the City 
uses a residential CET: 
• 
50% must be used for developer incentives (e.g. fee and SDC waivers, tax 
abatements, etc.) 
• 
35% may be used flexibly for affordable housing programs, as defined by 
the jurisdiction. 
• 
15% flows to Oregon Housing and Community Services for homeowner 
programs. 
If the City implements a CET on commercial or industrial uses, 50% of the funds 
must be used for allowed developer incentives and the remaining 50% are 
unrestricted. The rate may exceed 1% if levied on commercial or industrial uses. 
The City of Portland’s CET went into effect in 2016. It levies a 1% CET on 
residential, commercial, and industrial development valued at $100,000 or more, 
with all revenues going toward affordable housing. The revenues pay for 
production of housing at or below 60% AMI, developer incentives for inclusionary 
zoning, along with state homeownership programs.  
City of Bend adopted a CET of 0.3% on residential, commercial, and industrial 
development in 2006, with revenues dedicated to loans to fund developments by 
profit and nonprofit affordable housing developers. The fee has raised $11 million 
as of 2016, allowing the City to lend money to fund 615 units. The fund has 
leveraged $63 million in state and federal funding and $14 million in equity.  
The City of Milwaukie adopted a CET on commercial, residential, and industrial 
development in November of 2017. The City exempted deed-restricted affordable 
housing, ADUs, and improvements less than $100,000 from paying the CET. The 
adopting ordinance allocates funds as required by state statutes, specifying that 
flexible funds from the commercial improvements will be used 50% toward housing 
available to those making up to 120% of MFI, and 50% for economic development 
programs in areas with sub-area plans (such as Downtown and Riverfront, and the

Property taxes are increased to pay back the GO bonds. 
City of Portland passed $258 million bond for affordable housing in 2016. The goal 
of the bond is to build or preserve up to 1,300 units in the next five to seven years. 
The city issued a request for information to solicit interest in acquiring properties or 
land under the affordable housing bond. The city is looking for opportunities to 
acquire existing properties of 20 or more units, or vacant land that is appropriately

capital improvements, such as streetscape enhancements, underground utilities, 
or shared open space. For residential property, the estimated assessment cannot 
exceed the pre-improvement value of the property based on assessor records.  
An ordinance must be passed through a public hearing process which must be 
supported by a majority of affected property owners. Part of this process includes 
an estimation of the improvement costs and the portion of those costs in which 
property owners will be responsible to pay for. The public hearing process allows 
for LIDs to be challenged by property owners. 
The City collects the funds and regardless if the actual cost is greater than the 
estimated cost (on which the assessment was based), the City may make a deficit 
assessment for the additional cost, which would be prorated among all benefitted 
properties. Another public hearing would be held, in the event that an additional 
assessment was placed property owners (due to underestimation).

temporary lodgings. Oregon has a statewide TLT and cities and counties can also 
charge a local TLT subject to certain limitations. The statutes specify that 70% 
must be used for tourism promotion or tourism related facilities and 30% is 
unrestricted in use, and there cannot be a reduction of the total percent of room 
tax. The state tax is specified at 1.8%; local government tax rates vary as local 
governments set the rate for their jurisdiction by ordinance. Cities and counties 
may impose taxes on transient lodging. Alternatively, some cities have an 
agreement for the county to impose the tax and cities share in a percent of the 
revenue.

The HOME Investment Partnerships Program supports the development of low 
and very-low income affordable housing. It distributes federal funds, but each 
administering agency has unique structures and requirements. 
HOME funds: 
• Can be used for acquisition and rehabilitation of existing affordable units. 
• Can be used for new construction, depending on housing types, how the 
program is set up, and what community development efforts are prioritized.  
• Minimum of 90% of HOME funds used for rental housing must assist persons 
with household incomes below 60% of the median income. 20% must assist 
persons with household incomes below 50% of the median income.  
• Rents cannot exceed published low and high HOME rents for period of 
affordability. (Term of affordability is 5 to 20 years depending on type of activity). 
Scale of Impact – Depends on 
the amount of funding

Low Income 
Housing Tax 
Credit 
Program 
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is a federally established 
program that encourages investment in affordable housing through tax incentives; 
both for-profits and nonprofits are eligible, as well as private investors. Tax credits 
are sold with federal and state oversight.  
LIHTC funds:  
• May be used for acquiring and/or rehabilitating existing units whether or not they 
have been built with federal subsidies.  
• Requires that either 40% of a project’s units be set aside for renters earning less 
than 60% of the area’s MFI, or that 20% be dedicated to those earning less than 
50%. In addition, the gross rent can be no higher than 30% of imputed income 
from the MFI.  
• Maximum tax credit eligibility determined by multiplying the applicable annual 
percentage rate (4% to 9%) by the eligible cost of construction or rehab 
attributable to designated low-income units in the development. 
A key benefit of LIHTC is that it provides a mechanism for a private-public 
partnership, making private capital available to support the development of public 
housing. 
Drawbacks of LIHTC include: 
• Obtaining the tax credits is a very competitive process, especially for the 9% tax 
credits. Demand for the tax credits generally outstrips funding from the tax 
credits. 
• Oregon has a relatively small allocation of tax credits from the Federal 
government because our population is relatively small. 
• The application process is complex and takes several months. The reporting 
requirements are also complex. 
• The market for the price of tax credits is subject to drastic changes based on 
national policy changes. 
• The type of housing built with the tax credits does not meet the needs of the 
lowest income households (those with income below 30% of median family 
income) because the rents of affordable housing built with the tax credits targets 
households earning 50% to 80% of median family incomes.

DICUSSION/ACTION  
 
Community Development Director Jason Gottgetreu introduced the team from ECONorthwest which is led 
by Beth Goodman. He explained this project is to update the Housing Needs Analysis which is a City 
Council Goal. This will put the data behind a number of the policy issues the Affordable Housing Task 
Force has been discussing.  
 
Overview of the Project 
Beth Goodman and Margaret Raimann introduced themselves and provided an overview of the Silverton 
Housing Needs Analysis. Ms. Goodman explained a Housing Needs Analysis has two different pieces. 
The first is land use, does the City have enough land in the urban growth boundary (UGB) to 
accommodate expected growth over the next 20 years and will it be affordable for all households in 
Silverton. She said the project will also look at the needed types of housing, how much and where 
buildable land is located, and if the current development patterns make sense. She reviewed Statewide 
Planning Goal 10 which is related to buildable lands for residential use.

Ms. Goodman reviewed the needed housing types that are defined in ORS 197.303. Member Oster 
asked what the impact would be to Silverton if the City decided not to follow the state’s perspective on 
what housing is needed. Ms. Goodman explained the Housing Needs Analysis becomes part of the City’s 
Comprehensive Plan which guides the land designations within Silverton and it must be acknowledged by 
the state. She further explained if the City didn’t allow mobile or manufactured home parks in zones that 
allow 6-12 dwellings units per acre and someone wanted to develop a park on a piece of property they 
could sue the City and potentially win.   
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed the components of the project and how it will fit in with the City’s planning 
framework. The first component is the Housing Needs Analysis Technical Report which provides a factual 
basis and tells the City what is happening with buildable land and the demand for housing in Silverton. 
The Housing Strategy will begin to address the issues identified in the Housing Needs Analysis. These 
two documents will allow the City to revise the housing element in the Comprehensive Plan and the 
Housing Strategy could lead to changes in zoning code and housing policies and programs.    
 
Role of the Project Advisory Committee (i.e. Affordable Housing Task Force) 
Members will need to provide feedback on housing trends, buildable lands inventory, and the final 
Housing Needs Analysis document. Members will also be asked to provide local context and assist in 
facilitating discussion at public meetings.

Member Oster asked when ECONorthwest performs the developable land inventory if they contact the 
property owners of vacant undeveloped land. Ms. Goodman explained the Oregon system assumes all 
vacant land is potentially developable, even if the owner does not want to sell it. She said in Washington 
they assume 25 percent of vacant land will not develop over the 20 year period.  
 
Housing Market 
Ms. Goodman explained the types of housing; including, single-family detached (manufactured, mobile 
homes, and cottage housing), single-family attached (townhouses), multifamily (two-four units per 
structure such as duplexes, tri/quad-plexes), and multifamily (five plus units per structure). She reviewed 
the mix of housing in Silverton from 2000 and compared it to more recent data from 2013-2017. She said 
80 percent of the housing stock in Silverton is single family detached. The five year 2013-2017 data is 
collected from the US Census American Community Survey. She said there has been an increase in 
owner-occupied housing since 2000.  
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed the building permits that have been issued from 2000-2017 and reviewed the 
historical density (2000-2018) in Silverton. The vast majority of the development has been single family 
residential at 4.8 dwelling units per acre, which ends up being just over 8,000 square foot lots. She said 
multifamily residential has developed at 23.6 units per acre. There have been 4 commercial units 
developed since 2000. This information will be helpful for forecasting how much land is needed. 
Silverton’s 2018 population is 10,325; this represents an increase of 2,900 residents from 2000. Since the 
City is over the 10,000 population threshold it means Silverton is subject to House Bill (HB) 2001. 
Silverton grew faster than Marion County which grew at a 1.1 percent average annual growth rate. Ms. 
Goodman explained they will look at some of the demographic factors that will affect housing demand in 
Silverton over the next 20 years. These factors include age, household composition, income, and how 
housing needs change over a person’s lifetime. Since 2000 the number of residents over 60 years old 
has increased and now represents 21 percent of Silverton’s population. The senior population in Marion 
County is expected to continue to grow at a faster rate than the other age categories and will represent 25 
August 20, 2019 City of Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force Meeting Minutes  
Page 3 of 4 
 
percent of the population by 2040. Silverton has a little larger share of family households with children (38 
percent) and smaller share of nonfamily households than Marion County and the state. The median 
household income is $60,603, which is higher than the rest of the county and the state. She also 
reviewed the income by age groups and explained the majority of residents 65 and over has an annual 
income of less than $50,000. Lastly, the Latino population in Silverton has decreased since 2000, where 
Marion County and Oregon have become more diverse. She explained these demographics broadly show 
the City will need to have more affordable housing for families with children and seniors. She would also 
guess the decrease in Latino households could also be related to affordability. Silverton needs a wide 
array of housing that is both affordable for renters and owners.  
 
Ms. Goodman said the median home sale price for Silverton in May 2019 was $429,000. That represents 
an increase of $179,000 since 2006. The median gross rent (including utilities) in Silverton over a five 
year period (2013-2017) was $902 per month. Approximately 30 percent of Silverton households are 
paying 30 percent or more for housing costs and are cost burdened; about 11 percent are severely cost 
burdened. This number may have increased, because this data is from 2013-17 and housing costs have 
continued to increase. Ms. Goodman reviewed what people can afford based on the median family 
income. She reviewed the percentage of households in each income level and 11 percent are at the 
extremely low income and are the most at risk of becoming homeless. 14 percent of households are at 
the very low income level and 20 percent are considered low income. There is a deficit of 69 housing 
units for households that earn $10,000-$14,999 annually and a deficit of 111 units for income earners at 
$25,000-$34,999. There is also a deficit of 307 units for households that earn $150,000 per year. 
Typically cities will develop housing policies that focus on closing the deficit for lower income households 
and let the housing market address the executive housing needs for higher income earners.   
 
Buildable Land 
Margaret Raimann reviewed the preliminary buildable land inventory. She explained land is generally 
considered suitable and available as long as there are not geological constraints on the land. She 
reviewed the methodology and the steps it takes to figure out a city’s buildable land inventory and today 
the Task Force will be presented with the preliminary numbers.    
 
The inventory starts by looking at Comprehensive Plan designations and at land that allows residential 
uses outright. They also included the agricultural and urban reserve areas, the commercial zoning that 
allows residential uses, and one lot of industrial land that recently changed to R-1. She reviewed the land 
classifications; including, developed, vacant, partially vacant, undevelopable typically vacant tax lots less 
than 3,000 square feet in size, and pubic or exempt lots. Ms. Goodman explained the undevelopable 
definition for this inventory does not mean a City could not allow the development of a house on a 3,000 
square foot lot if it is a legal lot and the code allows they just don’t include it in the inventory as buildable. 
 
Ms. Raimann reviewed what is considered development constraints and indicated where those 
constraints are in Silverton. She said there are 285 acres of vacant land and 369 acres of partially vacant 
land. There are 632 buildable acres of residential designated land, 509 for single family, 19 for 
multifamily, and 104 for agriculture/urban reserve.  
 
Preliminary Housing Forecast 
Ms. Goodman explained Portland State University (PSU) has forecasted Silverton to grow by 3,058 
residents from 2020-2040. This represents a growth rate of 1.25 percent each year over the next 20 
years. This shows the need for 1,158 new dwelling units during the 2020-2040 period or an average of 58 
dwelling units per year. They have to take the 1,158 units and allocate the units into four different housing 
types. Looking at the historical data 80 percent of the housing mix is single-family detached; however, 
looking at the preliminary forecast the current market is not meeting the needs of the population. The 
preliminary forecast is recommending 753 single family dwelling units (65 percent), 81 single family 
attached (7 percent), 151 duplexes (13 percent), and 174 multifamily units (15 percent). This will help to 
determine the amount of land needed for each land designation and it is likely more land will be needed 
for multifamily housing.

Group Discussion: Desired Outcomes of the Project 
Member Freilinger indicated it looks like the City has enough buildable land, but will likely need to rezone 
some of the land to allow for higher density. Ms. Goodman explained increasing the multifamily housing 
units will be a big shift for the community, so it might be more acceptable to allow a wider range of 
housing types. Member Caster confirmed adding additional multifamily housing can be controversial at 
the Council level. Ms. Goodman explained the Task Force should likely move in the direction that allows 
for a lot of different types of housing and then look at drafting policies that make it difficult for people to 
oppose, like cottage style developments with specific design requirements. Member Caster asked what 
would happen if Silverton continues to have a 2 percent annual growth rate, instead of the 1.25 percent 
PSU is forecasting. Ms. Goodman said through the capacity analysis she will be to able show how much 
growth Silverton can support.  
 
Next Steps 
ECONorthwest will further refine the Housing Needs Analysis and Buildable Land results. At the 
September 17, 2019 meeting they would like to begin discussing possible housing policies with the Task 
Force. Ms. Goodman will review the prior meeting minutes and list out the things the Task Force has 
discussed and is interested in pursuing. Member White said the Task Force has not discussed renter’s 
rights and asked if that will be coming up in this analysis. Ms. Goodman responded that is not something 
ECONorthwest is very educated about, but if the Task Force chose to talk about it, they could bring in an 
expert to discuss options and include it as part of the policies.  
 
Member Oster said he thinks the analysis is going to show that Silverton is woefully low on multifamily 
housing opportunities and feels the demand for that type of housing is going to continue to grow. Ms. 
Goodman responded housing preference for senior citizens shows that a large number would like to 
continue to live their own home for as long as possible. She also indicated there has not been a huge 
shift across the nation from homeownership to renter.

DICUSSION OF PRELIMINARY CAPACITY AND LAND SUFFICIENCY RESULTS 
 
Beth Goodman introduced Sadie DiNatale with ECONorthwest who is also working on the Housing Needs 
Analysis for Silverton. Ms. Goodman explained today’s meeting will focus on the preliminary results of the 
analysis specifically the capacity for housing and land sufficiency. The last part of the meeting members 
will be discussing housing policies.  
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed a map of the unconstrained vacant and partially vacant land located in Silverton. 
This will help determine if there is enough land to accommodate growth in the city. There are 
approximately 654 acres of vacant unconstrained residentially designated land, 531 acres is zoned as 
single family residential, 19 acres is zoned multifamily, and 104 acres is zoned as agricultural or urban 
reserve. She explained all the multifamily land is zoned for single family uses which creates a problem. 
The 20 year population forecast is showing a need for 1,158 dwelling units. She said they are forecasting 
a greater share of single-family attached (duplex, triplex and quadplex) and multifamily complexes.    
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed the income level of current households and explained 46 percent of households 
are low income or below 80 percent of the Marion County Medium Family Income (MFI). That trend is

expected to stay the same over the 20 year period. This means affordability will continue to be an issue 
into the future.  
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed the historic net housing densities in Silverton from 2000 to 2018. She explained 
the current Housing Needs Analysis did not account for rights-of-way, but this update will include a 
percentage for rights-of-way. She reviewed the updated number of dwellings units per gross acre for each 
of the generalized plan designations. That number was used to calculate the capacity by dwelling unit of 
the unconstrained buildable land. Silverton has the capacity to build 1,965 new dwelling units in land 
designated as single-family and 270 units in the agricultural/urban reserve. She explained the multifamily 
totals will need to be adjusted. The problem is all the unconstrained buildable land is essentially zoned as 
single-family which means there is no land for multifamily density. This issue can be addressed during the 
policy discussion. She explained Silverton has a surplus of land designated as single-family and a 
shortage of about 12 acres or 239 dwelling units of multifamily. The City will need to address the lack of 
land available for multifamily housing in the Housing Needs Analysis.  
 
Member Sarah White asked about group housing and/or cohousing. She explained the Silverton 
Municipal Code only allows for six unrelated adults to share a house. Member Dana Smith said she has 
heard these types of policies may violate fair housing rules. Ms. Goodman said cohousing could be 
added to the list of policy changes the Task Force will discuss.  
 
Member Jason Freilinger stated the need for more multifamily housing, but would like to see a targeted 
approach to identify which land is the most suitable for multifamily development. He asked about the 
process to rezone land. Ms. Goodman explained a City does have the ability to rezone property without 
the owner’s approval, but the typical process would be for the developer or property owner to request the 
rezoning of the property. Member Freilinger stressed the need to make the most of what the City has and 
look at rezoning properties that are close to city services which in turn could lead to the development of 
more affordable housing. Ms. Goodman said the City could establish criteria for the areas they would like 
to up-zone to multifamily, with characteristics such as the size of lot, being close to city services, access 
to transportation, and within a quarter mile of a certain area. Then City staff could reach out the property 
owners that fit the criteria developed. Ms. Goodman said a City does not want to see all multifamily 
housing concentrated in one area, but look for the potential for disbursement throughout town.     
 
Karen Garst, 1205 Tenino Drive. Ms. Garst described the multifamily zoning in Bismarck, North Dakota 
where she grew up. She would like to see the City go back to a model that allows for more diversity and 
does not feel like we are putting people into categories.   
 
V. 
INTRODUCTION AND DISCUSSION: SILVERTON HOUSING STRATEGY 
 
Ms. Goodman explained how the Housing Needs Analysis will likely be an appendix to the 
Comprehensive Plan. The Housing Strategy will be policies and actions to address the needs identified in 
the Housing Needs Analysis. Both these documents will lead to changes in zoning code and in the 
Comprehensive Plan, but there will likely be housing policies not addressed through the Comprehensive 
Plan updates as well.   
 
Ms. Goodman referred to the Draft Silverton Housing Policies and Actions document included in the 
meeting packet. She explained how the document distinguishes between two types of affordable housing: 
1) housing affordable to very low-income and extremely low-income households and 2) housing 
affordable to low-income and middle-income households. The very low-income and extremely low-income 
households are those who have an income of 50 percent or less MFI, which is an annual household 
income of $34,700. About 17 percent of Silverton’s households fit into this category and can afford a 
monthly housing cost of $870 or less. Development of housing affordable to households at this income 
level is generally accomplished through development of government-subsidized income-restricted 
housing. The low-income and middle-income households are those who have an income of 50 to 120 
percent of the MFI or income of $34,700 to $83,280. About 38 percent of Silverton’s households fit into 
this category and they can afford a monthly housing cost of $870 to $2,080.  
 
September 17, 2019 City of Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force Meeting Minutes  
Page 3 of 4 
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed draft housing policies along with their objective and actions for the Task Force to 
consider and asked for the member’s feedback.  
 
• Policy 1: Ensure an adequate supply of land is available and serviced  
• Policy 2: Provide opportunities for housing development to meet the City’s identified housing needs 
• Policy 3: Provide opportunities for development of housing affordable to all income levels 
• Policy 4: Identify funding sources to support development of infrastructure and housing affordability 
programs  
 
Policy 1: Ensure an adequate supply of land is available and serviced. This policy plans for a 20-
year supply of suitable land with urban services and the necessary services for Silverton to meet housing 
needs within the existing planning area. Ms. Goodman explained this policy is stating the City will have 
enough land that is serviced, but if there is not enough land through the objectives then the City should be 
coordinating capital improvement planning for residential development. It does not mean the City has to 
proactively build it, but should proactively be planning for it. Essentially this is complying with Goal 10.  
 
The Task Force members reviewed the potential action items related to the first policy. Ms. Goodman 
said the second action item will be revised to be more reflective on the zone designation that is needed. 
The members decided to remove the fourth action item related to increasing the maximum building height 
in Multifamily Residential (RM-10) from three stories to four or five stories, because they felt that size 
would be out-of-place. Director Gottgetreu said four story buildings are allowed in the Downtown 
Commercial Zone. The members were okay with increasing the maximum density in the RM-20 zone from 
32 dwelling units per acre to 40 or more units per acre and agreed to emphasize the action item that 
would evaluate removing the maximum density standard and allowing the building height limitation, lot 
coverage standard and parking requirement to limit density in the RM-20 zone. Member Oster said he 
feels this would lead to the development of smaller units that are more affordable.  
 
The next action item was to reduce the minimum lot size in the Single-Family Residential (R-1) zone from 
7,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet. Ms. Goodman reminded the members House Bill 2001 requires 
the City to allow a duplex on every lot a single family house would be allowed outright. Member Oster 
said he would like to discuss decreasing the lot size to a minimum of 3,500 square feet. He said every 
development is different and this will allow for more options. The Web Lake Development is an example 
where smaller lot sizes have been allowed. Director Gottgetreu explained the density range has to stay 
within six units per acre within a subdivision. This would likely require a developer to create a mix of lot 
sizes in order to meet the density level. Member Freilinger said he has some hesitation on the 3,500 size, 
because of House Bill 2001 and the City is already working on a form based approach that would allow 
cottage style housing opposed to skinny lots. The members were agreeable to explore the 3,500 square 
foot lot size. 
 
Ms. Goodman provided an overview of House Bill 2001 which cities need to comply with by June 30, 
2021. The model code is expected to be released in December 2020. She will clarify the action item 
related to House Bill 2001 to encourage an earlier adoption.  Ms. Goodman reviewed the remaining 
action items under the first policy. She will amend the action item to identify areas of high priority for 
improving infrastructure to support new residential development in order to provide a stronger connection 
to the need for multifamily development. The Task Force members decided to remove the action item 
related to identifying opportunities to improve infrastructure in older neighborhoods to support infill.  
 
Policy 2: Provide opportunities for housing development to meet the City’s identified housing 
needs. This policy provides opportunities for development of a range of housing types that are affordable 
to households at all income levels. These housing types include (but are not limited to): single-family 
detached housing, accessory dwellings, cottage housing, manufactured housing, townhouses, duplexes, 
triplexes, quadplexes, and multifamily products (including apartments).   
 
The members discussed a possible action item that evaluates allowing courtyard apartments and cottage 
housing in subdivisions in the R-1 zone, with a goal of having these units rent at the $900-$1,200 price 
points. Ms. Goodman asked how the City would regulate the rent amount. Member White explained the 
September 17, 2019 City of Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force Meeting Minutes  
Page 4 of 4 
 
development could be required to rent at the Marion County Housing Authority rate for Section 8 Housing 
Vouchers, which are reviewed regularly. She explained if the City up-zones a regular lot for a cottage 
style development the City should require a certain percentage of the units be rented at the Section 8 
Housing Authority rate. Ms. Goodman explained there has to be other tools, such as a tax exemption, for 
the developer in order for them to be able to support it financially and want to build it. The administrative 
process will be something the City will need to figure out if this is a priority. She recommended separating 
the courtyard apartments and cottage housing in this action item, because the courtyard apartment piece 
will be more difficult. She urged the members to consider not controlling the rent of the cottage housing, 
but allowing them at a higher density which would let the size and smaller lots dictate the price of the unit. 
She said a separate action item could be created for the courtyard apartments that could be tied to the 
Marion County Section 8 rent prices and the action item could be to evaluate other policies that would be 
required to support this which will be a longer goal and more difficult. Members were agreeable to 
separating the action items as discussed.         
 
The members discussed the difference between single-room occupancy (SROs) and co-housing. Ms. 
Goodman explained people occupying SROs are more transient and they come and go whereas co-
housing is more deliberate. She will modify this action item to allow for more than six (instead of four) 
unrelated persons to live in the same unit.      
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed an action item related to tiny houses and allowing them as ADUs. She explained 
some of the unresolved issues surrounding tiny homes and will bring back additional information for the 
Task Force to consider.  
 
Scott Sanders, 21351 Bridge Creek Road SE. Mr. Sanders said he recently approached the City about a 
development plan and was told it is plausible, but before he could even meet with City staff he would 
need to pay $1,100 and it could still be denied. He explained the price tag is a big hurdle to creating 
affordable housing. Mayor Palmer said the staff will accommodate discussing high level details with 
developers, but if you would like to discuss the plans in more detail it takes a lot of staff time to do that 
and Silverton has very limited staff. Mr. Sanders said the cost is a barrier to building affordable housing.

NEXT STEPS 
 
Ms. Goodman said ECONorthwest will continue to refine the Housing Needs Analysis and the Task Force 
will continue to discuss the housing needs policies at the October 15, 2019 meeting.

HOUSING STRATEGY: DISCUSS PROPOSED NEW POLICIES, OBJECTIVES, AND 
ACTIONS 
 
Beth Goodman with ECONorthwest reviewed the meeting timeline and announced an open house has 
been scheduled for December 3, 2019.  
 
At the last meeting the Task Force reviewed the first two draft policies and actions for the Housing 
Strategy. The members feedback is reflected in the updated document located in the meeting packet. Ms. 
Goodman is seeking feedback on the third and fourth polices today. At the November meeting members 
will be able to review the complete document one last time and provide additional comments. Input from 
the public will occur at the open house. The last meeting of the process will occur in December in order to 
review the final document and make any necessary changes. She explained the Housing Needs Analysis 
could be adopted as an appendix to the Comprehensive Plan. The objectives and policies will replace the 
existing policies in the Comprehensive Plan and the actions would live on in a separate document that will 
guide staff’s work with the Planning Commission and City Council over the next few years.

Ms. Goodman provided a high level review of the housing policies and actions discussed at the last 
meeting.  
 
Policy 3: Provide opportunities for development of housing affordable to all income levels.  
Ms. Goodman explained this policy is to support the development of affordable housing for very-low and 
low-income households, as well as middle-income households. The members reviewed Objective 3.1 
under this policy which is to support the development of government-subsidized low-income housing 
through partnering with non-profit, for-profit, and governmental developers of low income affordable 
housing. This would be housing available at 50 percent or less median family income (MFI). She 
explained this housing cannot be built by the market and is the hardest housing to finance and build. The 
action item under this objective would be to provide density bonuses and other incentives that support the 
development of affordable housing, including entry-level ownership units. Another action item is to identify 
surplus of publicly owned properties that could be used for affordable housing. This would require 
partnering with the developer(s) of low-income housing to develop affordable housing for households 
earning less than 60 percent of MFI. The members discussed adding an action regarding partnering with 
developers of government subsidized housing which would allow for a broad range of options including 
low income senior housing. Ms. Goodman is recommending splitting out objective 3.1 in order to have 
actions related to meeting the housing needs for households at 50 percent MFI and a separate objective 
for market rate housing. Discussion ensued on potential city property and having an action item to identify 
and evaluate city owned surplus properties. Not having to purchase land can make the development 
more financially feasible to partner entities.  
 
Member Ainsley would like to see more community education around the type of housing currently in 
Silverton and the lack of affordable housing. This could include a series of articles in Our Town, press 
releases, and spreading the message at community events. This outreach could help to reduce 
resistance later in the process. Members discussed hosting a representative from Oregon Housing and 
Community Services (OHCS) to discuss their rural housing initiative.  
 
Ben Wilt, 225 Franklin Ave, Mt. Angel. Mr. Wilt is the Construction Manager with North Willamette Valley 
Habitat for Humanity. He said a number of larger cities are pursuing community land trust models. This 
allows for the land cost to be taken out the equation regarding the development.  
 
Ms. Goodman said if the City does decide to donate surplus land or even with some of the other policies 
discussed there needs to be a mechanism in place where the City can ensure the affordability of the units 
for a certain period of time. If the City puts in a lot of subsidy, it may be appropriate to require affordability 
over a 50 year period. The Task Force discussed the possibilities of using tax credits as an incentive and 
Member Johnsen explained NeighborWorks will be offering classes about this topic later this year.  
 
Ms. Goodman referred members to the appendix part of the packet and asked them to review the 
potential strategies to modify land use regulations in order to increase housing affordability. She 
explained if the City chooses to utilize one of the strategies listed additional analysis will need to be done 
in order to make sure it will work for Silverton. That process will be done outside of the Housing Needs 
Analysis.  
  
The Task Force reviewed objective 3.2 supporting development of all types of multifamily affordable 
housing, market rate or government subsidized affordable housing, through use of tools to lower 
development or operational costs or make the development process simpler or faster. Ms. Goodman will 
remove the word multifamily from the first sentence. The City could look into performing an audit on the 
development code to find ways to be more efficient. One of the action items is to reduce or waive system 
development charges (SDCs) for development of housing affordable at or below 60 percent or less of 
MFI. Member Freilinger would like to add the following statement: there needs to be an alternate funding 
source identified to backfill the loss of revenue. This will have a fiscal impact to the City. Member Johnsen 
explained one of the easier funding grants for a developer to get from the federal government is money to 
cover the SDC fees of the development. She would hate to see the City lose SDC income, because the 
City needs that money for infrastructure projects. Ms. Goodman said a different approach could be to 
develop a sliding scale for SDCs. Member Freilinger said the sliding scale seems like a more workable 
October 15, 2019 City of Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force Meeting Minutes  
Page 3 of 4 
 
option. Member Smith said the language needs to make it clear the sliding scale would be based on the 
size of the development.  
 
Ms. Goodman reviewed the next action item which is to reduce development costs through changes to 
infrastructure development standards, when appropriate. For example, allow development of duplexes 
with a single-sewer line or allow one water meter for multiple cottage units. The Task Force would like to 
add where safety and public health is not impacted.  
 
The fourth action item is to evaluate developing a tax exemption program, such as the Multiple Unit 
Housing tax exemption or the Low-Income Rental Housing tax exemption. Ms. Goodman will add a table 
that describes the various programs and the pros and cons with each. The City would have to develop the 
program which includes setting the district, award criteria, and the process for evaluating. The program is 
discretionary so it is a good program for cities. Ms. Goodman will provide additional information about tax 
exemption programs so members can pick the ones they are most interested in.   
 
Member Ainsley proposed adding language regarding diverse and/or mixed income neighborhoods. The 
members were supportive of Ms. Goodman including similar language in an overarching goal for this 
document.  
 
The members decided to remove the action item related to inclusionary zoning.  
 
The last action item discussed was to partner with organizations to establish or participate in a land bank 
or land trust, to support affordable housing by reducing or eliminating land cost from the development 
process. ECONorthwest will provide additional information regarding this action item.  
 
The members decided to include an action item related to density bonuses to allow for more quadplexes. 
This is something the City Council could grant on a discretionary basis through certain criteria. The City 
would have to determine where the density bonuses would be allowed, it could apply to certain types of 
houses in certain zones. Director Gottgetreu said this could be a tool for infill development. The Task 
Force discussed clustered residential development and how to streamline the Planned Unit Development 
(PUD) process and costs associated with it.   
 
Policy 4: Identify funding sources to support development of infrastructure and housing 
affordability programs.  
This policy is related to the development of funding sources to pay for the costs of implementing the 
affordable housing programs described in Policy 3 and infrastructure improvements in Policy 1. Ms. 
Goodman explained how Urban Renewal funds could be used to support the development of 
infrastructure necessary to support housing development in key areas of Silverton. Members discussed 
how the City’s current Urban Renewal District is focused on the downtown, commercial and industrial 
development. Member Freilinger said it would be nice to focus on housing for the next district specifically 
in the North side of town. It could require the closing of the existing district and opening a new district. Ms. 
Goodman explained an Urban Renewal District has to increase the overall property taxes in the district, 
so it could focus on housing, but should also include some commercial or other types of development to 
ensure the growth in property taxes. ECONorthwest will provide additional information about how Urban 
Renewal can support housing.  
 
Another possible revenue source is a Construction Excise Tax (CET) which could be used to offset the 
reduction in SDCs. Member Caster said he is concerned it would increase the cost of building. 
ECONorthwest will provide the Task Force with additional information about a CET. Other possible 
sources of revenue include using a small portion of Transient Lodge Taxes, General Obligation Bonds, 
Bancroft Bonds, and/or marijuana taxes.

PUBLIC COMMENT  
 
Ben Wilt, 225 Franklin Street, Mt. Angel. Mr. Wilt spoke on behalf of Habitat for Humanity and expressed 
his gratitude for the forum that is happening through these meetings. He stressed the importance of 
actionable policies coming out of this effort.    
 
Karen Garst, 1205 Tenino Drive. Ms. Garst would like to applaud the City for the request for proposal 
regarding the Westfield property. She thinks it is a great idea, because Silverton needs more affordable 
housing. There is a two year waiting list at the Silvertowne Apartments and Silverton needs more housing 
options whether its transitional housing, senior housing, etc. She has been volunteering with Sheltering 
Silverton and has worked with a number of individuals who need housing, including veterans.

HOUSING STRATEGY: DISCUSS REVISED POLICIES, OBJECTIVES, AND ACTIONS 
 
Beth Goodman and Sadie DiNatale with ECONorthwest continued the discussion regarding the revised 
policies, objectives and actions. She explained the Housing Needs Analysis is also included in the packet 
for the members to review and provide comments. She requested members send questions and/or 
comments to Community Development Director Jason Gottgetreu. The feedback and direction regarding 
the Housing Policies and Strategies from this meeting will be presented to the public at the Affordable

Housing Open House scheduled for Tuesday, December 3, 2019. The December 17, 2019 meeting will 
be the last meeting with the consultants and the members will review the Policies and Actions one last 
time and discuss the timing of the priorities.  
 
Member Smith asked where the Comprehensive Plan updates fit into the process. Director Gottgetreu 
explained the Housing Needs Analysis will be run through the public approval process as a post 
acknowledgement plan amendment. This is done through the Department of Land Conservation and 
Development which is keeping tabs on the process. It will replace the housing needs element portion of 
the plan. Member Smith asked if there will be an overall one time revision of the Comprehensive Plan or 
will all the sections be inserted piece-by-piece. Director Gottgetreu said the City is performing the update 
on an individualized approach and each section will be adopted as updates to the Comprehensive Plan.    
 
Ms. Goodman asked if there were any comments or questions regarding the draft Housing Needs 
Analysis. There were no comments or questions. Ms. Goodman walked the members through the draft 
Housing Policies and Actions and the changes made to the document since the last meeting.  
 
Policy 1: Ensure an adequate supply of land is available and serviced. The members were fine with 
the language in Objective 1.1. After the meeting Ms. Goodman added Action 1.2.d under Objective 1.2. 
This action item calls for the evaluation of the requirements related to planting strips with new sidewalks 
and roads. There might be places where planting strips are not necessary, such as quiet residential 
neighborhoods. If this requirement were removed it could increase density and lower the development 
costs. Member Caster voiced his concern regarding the maximum five lots per acre requirement which 
limits density. Ms. Goodman recommended amending Action 1.2.a to address maximum density as well 
as the minimum lot size. Member Freilinger asked if the maximum density is increased will there still be a 
difference between R-1 and R-5 zoning. Director Gottgetreu explained the difference is R-5 allows up to 
10 units per acre and multi-family. Member Freilinger said he feels as long as the City sticks to the single 
family home model the City is never going to reach affordability no matter what the lot size is.  
 
Policy 2: Provide opportunities for housing development to meet that City’s identified housing 
needs. Objective 2.1 has not changed since the last meeting and is to ensure the City’s compliance with 
House Bill 2001 which requires the City to allow the development of a duplex on each lot or parcel zoned 
for residential use. Objective 2.2 goes beyond 2.1 and encourages a wider range of housing types. Action 
item 2.2.f was added since last week and would evaluate removing the standard that a manufactured 
home be multi-sectional and have an enclosed floor area of not less than 1,000 square feet. Member 
Oster said he asked about this item, because there is not a minimum square footage requirement for a 
stick built home or on-site construction. He feels this is out of line, because the standard of construction 
has greatly improved for manufactured homes and does not feel like the City should discriminate against 
on-site versus off-site construction. Both types of construction have to meet the same architectural design 
elements. Manufactured homes have to meet the energy code standards prior to placement. Ms. 
Goodman explained action item 2.3.e was added in order to identify opportunities to streamline the 
process and standards for Planned Developments to make it easier and less costly. This could mean 
reducing the requirements for open space, limiting the hearing process, and looking at reducing the fees 
associated with the PUD application. The word maximum will be added to action item 2.3.c to make it 
clear ADU’s can be smaller than 800 square feet. Action item 2.3.g was also added and would evaluate 
allowing clustering of houses on a parcel with constraints that prohibit or limit development, such as a 
flood plain. Member Caster asked to add wetlands into this action item. Member Ainsley asked if 
encouraging alternative types of construction should be added into the language somewhere. Ms. 
Goodman explained the Department of State Lands would have to approve the construction type and it 
would have to comply with building codes.  
 
Ms. Goodman explained the last objective under this policy is to encourage development of mixed-use 
multifamily housing in commercial zones. She also said there needs to be an additional action item to 
rezone land to RM 10 and RM 20, because currently the City does not have any vacant land with that 
designation. Member Freilinger asked if mixed-use housing could also be encouraged in industrial zones, 
because the City has an abundance of industrial land. Ms. Goodman asked if the City would consider 
rezoning some industrial land to commercial or RM 10 or RM 20, because conflicts of use could occur 
November 19, 2019 City of Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force Meeting Minutes  
Page 3 of 4 
 
between industrial uses and housing. Director Gottgetreu said only caretaker housing is allowed in 
industrial zones currently, but Marion County Economic Development officials have been exploring 
options for live/work scenarios in industrial zones. Member Smith asked for clarification on if mixed-use 
development could include parcels that are strictly residential and not associated with a commercial use. 
Ms. Goodman said she has encouraged that in cities that are similar to Silverton, because sometimes the 
mixed use does not pencil out. She said building an apartment building is a way to get more housing at a 
lower rent point in the downtown. Task Force members discussed this idea and Member Smith raised her 
concerns about it being functional long term, because it could constrain commercial growth in the 
downtown. Ms. Goodman said it could be considered as a conditional use and Director Gottgetreu said 
there could be a minimum requirement for commercial, i.e. 50 percent of the ground floor.    
 
Policy 3: Provide opportunities for development of housing affordable to all income levels. Ms. 
Goodman explained Objective 3.1 was amended to support the development of income-restricted 
housing for households with an income of 60 percent of Median Family Income (MFI) for Marion County. 
60 percent is generally the cut off for the housing authority. Action Item 3.1.c was added to identify 
surplus publicly owned properties that could be used for affordable housing. This action item also seeks 
to identify the deficiencies that are necessary to allow development of the properties. Hilary Dumitrescu 
with Sheltering Silverton said the City does have an opportunity to show the community what an 
incremental development could look like for a project like this. She said a lot of push back from the 
community in terms of development is in response to development such as Pioneer. There were a 
number of people who thought it was too much and too big and it swallowed a huge swath of land, but 
there is an opportunity with the Westfield property to do a really beautiful community based development 
that responds to what the community actually needs. If it can be done successfully on this site it might not 
be as painful in other spaces, but it must be done collaboratively. Ms. Goodman explained Action Item 
3.1.d was added in response to comments from the Task Force and relates to being aware of the 
financial tools available for income-restricted housing developers.  
 
Objective 3.3 supports the development of all types of affordable housing, market rate or income-
restricted affordable housing, through use of tools to lower development or operational costs or make the 
development process simpler or faster. Ms. Goodman explained these are tools the City will need to 
develop criteria for. This could include providing a density bonus or a reduction in system development 
charges (SDCs) and the members discussed Newport’s sliding SDC scale. Also discussed were other 
ways to incentivize affordable housing through SDCs. Members reviewed Action Item 3.3.d and Ms. 
Goodman pointed out City Council has already passed the Low Income Rental Housing Tax Exemption, 
but there are other programs the City could adopt as well.         
 
The last actionable item discussed under Policy 3 was to evaluate partnering with an organization to 
establish or participate in a land bank or land trust. Silverton most likely does not want to be in the driver’s 
seat, but could consider being involved in one. Members discussed how this type of partnership could 
work. Ben Wilt said he has seen them structured through a long term lease (50 plus years) which is then 
typically rolled over to a new term. The sale of the property happens separate from the sale of the land. 
The City would not receive direct financial benefits from the property, but land donation is one way to 
make the cost of development less expensive. There was consensus to leave this in the Housing Policies 
and Actions as a possible action item. Member Caster asked for the names of land banks and trusts in 
the area.   
 
Policy 4: Identify funding sources to support development of infrastructure and housing 
affordability programs. The City will need to identify funding sources in order to pay for the incentives 
discussed earlier. Action Item 4.1.a is evaluating the expansion of the existing Urban Renewal District or 
adding a new District, with the purpose of supporting the development of market-rate and income-
restricted affordable housing. Ms. Goodman explained urban renewal is very good at supporting the 
development of infrastructure necessary for the development of affordable housing. Another funding 
source that could be explored is a construction excise tax (CET). The CET is a tax assessed on 
construction permits issued by local cities and counties and it has the most flexibility in what it can be 
used for. For example it can be used to backfill the funds not collected due to SDC waivers or reductions. 
Ms. Goodman stressed it is very important to get the development community on board in order for the 
November 19, 2019 City of Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force Meeting Minutes  
Page 4 of 4 
 
CET to be successful. Low income housing could be exempt from paying the CET and it could also only 
be implemented on commercial or industrial as well.        
 
V. 
NEXT STEPS 
 
Ms. Goodman said the public will have an opportunity to ask questions and give their feedback at the 
Open House scheduled for Tuesday, December 3, 2019. Ms. Goodman explained the Open House will 
start with a presentation and then there will be a series of discussions about the strategy and the staff will 
be asking questions that participants will answer through an online survey tool. The policies being 
discussed at the Task Force will be printed on large posters and people will place dots on the policies 
they like and/or dislike. The results from the Open House will be shared with the Task Force at their 
December 17, 2019 meeting.

PUBLIC COMMENT  
 
Ben Wilt, 745 15th Street NE, Salem. Mr. Wilt stressed the importance of building coalitions as the City 
moves forward with this effort. The City of Woodburn’s Housing Needs Analysis was released and 
recommendations were put forward only for the Planning Commission to not accept them. The work done 
with this Task Force needs to be in-step with the Planning Commission, because recent zone changes 
that have gone before the Planning Commission have failed. This would have totaled 9.5 acres of land for 
multifamily housing which there currently is not an inventory for. He said it is important to bring those 
voices in during the visioning process. Member Ainsley asked if Mr. Wilt could share his written testimony 
that was submitted to the City of Woodburn and he said he will.  
 
IV. 
HOUSING STRATEGY 
 
Overview of Open House 
Beth Goodman and Sadie DiNatale with ECONorthwest summarized the feedback that was received 
during the Open House. Ms. Goodman said there was a lot of support at the Open House for affordable 
housing and building a wider range of housing types in Silverton. The Construction Excise Tax (CET) was 
the only strategy that was viewed as a low priority by the attendees. Councilor Smith said if the City is 
going to lower SDCs for affordable housing, then the CET could be a way to help pay for that. Members 
discussed their observations from the Open House and the community participation. Member White said

December 17, 2019 City of Silverton Affordable Housing Task Force Meeting Minutes  
Page 2 of 3 
 
the Task Force should anticipate some community pushback, because people do not want to see large 
apartment complexes. She said it will be important to place parameters around the development and to 
show community members pictures of what a good development could look like. It will be important to not 
only discuss the possible code language, but also show visually that affordable housing can be attractive, 
charming, and fit with the character of the community. Discussion ensued on previous efforts to rezone 
land in Silverton to multifamily and Member Caster shared his experience being a developer.  
 
Ms. Goodman said ECONorthwest has identified a deficit of 17 acres for multifamily housing. She said 
the expectation is to not to build one big apartment complex to close the deficit, but to accommodate 
some of it in the downtown and some might be accommodated by the zone changes being discussed. 
This Task Force has been talking more about integrated housing. Member Smith explained the rationale 
behind some of the decisions that have been made at the Planning Commission and City Council level. 
She said this process will lead to more defined code language that better describes what a development 
should look like rather than opening up zone changes to anything that can happen. The concern has 
been without changes to the code things will not mesh well and multifamily development would not be 
compatible with the proposed neighborhoods. 
 
Review of the Draft Housing Strategies 
Ms. Goodman reviewed the changes made to the draft Housing Strategies since the last meeting. Those 
changes include: 
 
Objective/ 
Action Item 
Change 
1.1.b 
Added the City may consider re-zoning industrial land to RM-10 or RM-20. 
1.2.a 
Added if the minimum lot sizes are increased, increase the maximum density allowed.* 
2.4 
Added Action Item 2.4.b to evaluate developing a policy and development standards to 
allow for development of multifamily residential buildings in the downtown.  
2.4 
Added Action Item 2.4.d to identify opportunities to re-zone industrial land to commercial 
mixed use. 
2.4 
Added Action Item 2.4.e to evaluate developing a policy and development standards to 
allow live/work housing in limited circumstances in industrial areas.  
3.3 
A note was added to clarify the City has recently adopted the Low-Income Rental Housing 
Tax Exemption tool.  
 
Member Ainsley asked if an action item should be added regarding an educational process and how to 
best educate the community about the proposals in the strategy. Ms. Goodman said it is part of the 
overarching goal, but could be added as an action item under policy 2. Member Johnsen said it should 
also tie into the City’s long term planning and infrastructure needs. She further explained part of the 
outreach efforts she does when planning multifamily housing is educating people about a city’s long term 
infrastructure need and how those get paid for. These projects pay SDC fees and would pay a CET tax 
which helps the city pay for infrastructure costs. She said this also needs to be included in the educational 
piece. These types of projects will bring in money to help ensure the City is sustainable well into the 
future. She also explained there is state and federal funding that will help fund larger infrastructure needs 
associated with multifamily housing projects, such as a large road improvement. LIFT funding is a good 
example of a funding source that is dedicated to funding infrastructure. Discussion ensued on the type of 
infrastructure projects that are eligible for SDC funds and the type of projects CET funds can be spent on. 
 
After the discussion regarding the importance of education Ms. Goodman is recommending creating an 
action goal, because it really is an umbrella over the whole strategy. Member White said it would be 
interesting to see a funding matrix for the CET and how much money that could bring into Silverton, as 
well as hearing what the long term impacts to the City could be. She would also like to see a breakdown 
of all the funding sources for infrastructure and how those are leveraged to reflect community values. Ms. 
                                            
* To be modified to read “if minimum lot sizes are decreased, increase the maximum density allowed."

Goodman explained those are items that will need to be looked at during the implementation phase of the 
strategy. She is recommending adding an action item regarding evaluating a CET and to look at the 
benefits and drawbacks of a CET in relation to the City’s expenditures and costs. Members discussed 
skinny streets and how to best highlight the need to scale down not just houses and lot sizes but other 
items associated with that.  
 
Implementation Schedule 
The members took a break at 9:39 a.m. in order to individually prioritize their implementation schedules. 
The meeting reconvened at 9:59 a.m. The members discussed how they prioritized the strategies and 
which strategies they felt were the most important and needed to get started in 2020 and/or 2021. These 
results will help staff develop a work plan over the next five years.  
 
V. 
NEXT STEPS 
 
ECONorthwest will review the individual priority worksheets and tally the scores. The results will be 
incorporated into the Housing Needs Analysis.   
 
VI.
