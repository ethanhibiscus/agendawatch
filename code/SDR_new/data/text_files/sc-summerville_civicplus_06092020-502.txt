STAFF REPORT
BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
June 9, 2020
Request: Variance request to reduce the required side yard setback from 15 feet to two feet for an 
attached carport. 
Property Zoning: 
GR-2 General Residential
Surrounding Zoning:
North: GR-2 General Residential
South: GR-2 General Residential
East: GR-2 General Residential
West: GR-2 General Residential
Ordinance requires: Ordinance Section 2.7.3.C Side Setback – 15 feet
Response: In order for a variance to be issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals, an applicant is 
required to show that all four of the conditions listed below have been met and an unnecessary 
hardship must be shown.
(b) Variances. The board has the power to hear and decide requests for variances when strict 
application of this chapter's provisions would cause an unnecessary hardship. 
(1) The following standards must apply for finding an unnecessary hardship: 
a. Extraordinary conditions. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to 
the particular piece of property, which could exist due to topography, street widening or 
other conditions which make it difficult or impossible to make an economically feasible use 
of the property. 
b. Other property. Extraordinary conditions generally do not apply to other property in the 
vicinity. 
c. Utilization. Because of these extraordinary conditions, the application of this chapter's 
provisions to a particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably 
restrict the utilization of the property. 
d. Detriment. The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent 
property or the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by granting of 
the variance.
Background: The setback variance was determined prior to application to construct the carport
Staff feels that the applicant does not meet all four criteria, and that a hardship is present.
a.
Extraordinary conditions exist in the form of existing conditions, the property is deep and 
narrow. The primary structure was centered on the lot, resulting in the need for a variance 
on either side.
b.
Other property in the area do not have similar lot shape and would not face similar 
constraints.
c.
Utilization of the property is reduced but not eliminated due to the shape of the lot.
d.
Detriment will not be caused to other properties by the issuance of this variance on this 
property.
a)
 The land is a narrow lot and I would like to put a leaning overhang for a carport.
b)
The property next door adjoins by bushes and it would not look out of place for the other 
homeowner.
c)
Due to the narrow lot, if I do not get the variance I would be unable to put two cars in the 
carport and it would be useless for one.
d)
The character of the district will not be harmed.  The house is white, black shutters and a red 
door which keeps with the Summerville theme.  The carport would be painted the same white, 
with same color roof.  It cannot be seen to anyone except myself and the one neighbor of which 
that is the side of his house that has no windows.  It will keep with the BAR expectations and 
upkeep.

Ordinance requires: Ordinance Section 32-322, Class 2 planting area Town of Summerville old zoning.
Response: In order for a variance to be issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals, an applicant is required to 
show that all four of the conditions listed below have been met and an unnecessary hardship must be 
shown.
(b) Variances. The board has the power to hear and decide requests for variances when strict application of this 
chapter's provisions would cause an unnecessary hardship. 
(1) The following standards must apply for finding an unnecessary hardship: 
a. Extraordinary conditions. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the 
particular piece of property, which could exist due to topography, street widening or other conditions 
which make it difficult or impossible to make an economically feasible use of the property. 
b. Other property. Extraordinary conditions generally do not apply to other property in the vicinity. 
c. Utilization. Because of these extraordinary conditions, the application of this chapter's provisions to a 
particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the 
property. 
d. Detriment. The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property or 
the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by granting of the variance. 
Background: The applicant approached staff concerning the request for the variance as the project was 
nearing completion of construction. The project was approved under the Town’s prior ordinance which 
required a Class 2 Use buffer between the new use and the existing adjacent uses. The plan that was 
approved appeared to be able to accommodate the requirements. Upon completion it has been determined 
that the planting buffer will not be able to meet the requirements of the old ordinance.
Staff feels that the applicant has met all four criteria, and that a hardship is present.
a.
Extraordinary conditions exist in the form of the existing conditions, where the structure 
placement on the property prevents the implementation of the required use buffers.
b.
Other property in the area are mostly undeveloped and will in the future be developed under the 
UDO requirements.
2
c.
Utilization of the property is greatly impacted by the placement of the housing structure on the 
lot, to be able to meet parking requirements the rear of the “houses” had to be backed up as close 
to the property line as possible. TO meet drainage requirements this area should be free of 
obstructions which could impede the flow of potential stormwater. 
d.
Detriment will not be caused to other properties by the issuance of this variance on this property
247 Judith Drive Variance request:
The current approved landscape plan submitted to the Town of Summerville and approved for 
construction shows a class 2 buffer along the rear of the property as it adjoins the PUD.  The buffer 
requires plantings including canopy trees and understory trees along with a privacy fence.  Currently 
there is a Summerville CPW easement in this location for the main water line coming from the adjacent 
water tower.  Trees of any sort planted on top of the easement would be subject to removal for access 
and service of the existing line. Also, along this property line is an overhead power service servicing the 
water tower.  Lastly per the approved grading plans the planting area is effectively a drainage swale.  
There are a number of existing trees on the property line (noted on the attached plat/ as built).  
The adjoining property to be screened or buffered by this fence and planting is the trailer/ boat storage 
for the PUD not any homes.  Behind the storage lot is the water tower owned by Summerville CPW.  
I request the plantings and fence be removed from the requirements as they can not be installed per the 
approved plan set because of the easement, overhead power, and the grade.  
The current approved landscape plan shows landscape plantings along Judith Drive.  There is an 
overhead power line in this location, and I request the canopy trees be changed to understory as not to 
conflict with the service line.

VARIANCE REQUEST
TMS#136-08-06-062
415 Hemingway Circle, Summerville, SC
STAFF REPORT
BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
June 9, 2020
Request: Variance request to reduce the required side yard setback to seven (7) feet. 
Property Zoning: 
NR - Neighborhood Residential
Surrounding Zoning:
North: NR - Neighborhood Residential
South: NR - Neighborhood Residential
East: NR - Neighborhood Residential
West: NR - Neighborhood Residential
Ordinance requires: Ordinance Section 2.5 side setback.
Response: In order for a variance to be issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals, an applicant is 
required to show that all four of the conditions listed below have been met and an unnecessary 
hardship must be shown.
(b) Variances. The board has the power to hear and decide requests for variances when strict 
application of this chapter's provisions would cause an unnecessary hardship. 
(1) The following standards must apply for finding an unnecessary hardship: 
a. Extraordinary conditions. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions 
pertaining to the particular piece of property, which could exist due to topography, 
street widening or other conditions which make it difficult or impossible to make an 
economically feasible use of the property. 
b. Other property. Extraordinary conditions generally do not apply to other property in 
the vicinity. 
c. Utilization. Because of these extraordinary conditions, the application of this 
chapter's provisions to a particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or 
unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property. 
d. Detriment. The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to 
adjacent property or the public good, and the character of the district will not be 
harmed by granting of the variance.
Background: The applicant was notified by staff concerning the need for the setback variance at 
the time of permit application. The plat shows the required setback at the time of construction of 
the Townhouses. The proposed 12 foot by eight foot screened in porch will encroach into the 
required setback. THe proposed setback will be established at seven (7) feet.
The applicant’s request appears to meet all four criteria for the approval of a variance.
I live at 415 Hemingway Circle.  It is an end unit in a townhouse building.  I absolutely love 
everything about my neighborhood.  I have a patio that is right off the side of my house.  I enjoy 
sitting out there with my children and friends.  I would really love to screen in the patio so that I 
can get even more use of the space.
Our plan is to build directly around the existing patio.  We will put a roof on top and it will have 
door that will be facing the back.  All trim will be white and any other shingles will match the 
hardie plank that already exists.   The patio, as it sits, is only 7 feet from the property line.  I 
realize that the town ordinance is 15 feet.  However, I do not feel this structure would cause 
any extraordinary conditions to my property or any of the properties around me.  The property 
between us is grassy and I do not foresee the structure causing any issues with landscaping, 
utilities or walkways.  This structure would not restrict any person from gaining access to any 
property or utilizes for any property around us. 
I am attaching pictures to this file that shows what the existing patio looks like along with the 
plans that we had drawn up for our plans.  
Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Gretchen Kondroski

Response: In order for a variance to be issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals, an applicant is required to 
show that all four of the conditions listed below have been met and an unnecessary hardship must be 
shown.
(b) Variances. The board has the power to hear and decide requests for variances when strict application of this

the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by granting of the variance. 
Background: The applicant acquired the property and intends to renovate the existing building for office 
uses. With a change in use from residential to commercial office the applicant has proposed three new 
parking spaces to the rear of the structure, and one ADA space in front. With the establishment of new 
parking the UDO requires an eight foot landscaped screen.
Staff feels that the applicant does not meet all four criteria, and that a hardship is present.
a.
Extraordinary conditions exist in the form of the existing conditions, where the structure 
placement on the property prevents the implementation of the required parking lot screening.
b.
Other property in the area are mostly developed will be subject to the UDO requirments only if 
they redevelop.
2
c.
Utilization of the property is greatly impacted by the placement of the structure on the lot, the 
three proposed parking spaces barely fit to the rear of the structure at this time, the D_MX zoning 
does not require parking be provided on site.
d.
Detriment will not be caused to other properties by the issuance of this variance on this property

(b) Variances. The board has the power to hear and decide requests for variances when strict

Background: The need for the setback and lot coverage variance was determined at the time of 
application for the permit to construct the shed. 
Staff feels that the applicant does not meet all four criteria, and that a hardship is not present.
a.
Extraordinary conditions could exist, the requirements of the Bridges does not 
differentiate between primary and accessory structure for the setback requirement. If this 
were GR-2 zoning the required side setback would be 10 feet
b.
Other property in the area do have similar lot size and shape and would potentially face

c.
Utilization of the property is reduced but not eliminated due to the size and shape of the

Request to build shed
Request to build shed within setbacks. Due to locations of trees and setting of
house more toward the middle of the property, its unlikely to build a shed 20 ft
the rear property line. However, there is no adjacent property behind the house,
and plenty of space between the property and the pond line that easily exceeds the
20 ft of space required. Also, trees in the rear yard prevent the shed building
more than 3-4ft from the side property. Request to build within these setbacks is
requested.
Request to increase total impervious surface allowance. Building of shed would
surpass the total impervious allowance by a slight amount (96 sq ft.) Also, shed
is to be built on deck blocks that would raise it above the ground level, allow
water to continue to freely flow. Shed is also to be build underneath tree canopy
which limits the amount of existing water that would have been redirected due to
the shed anyway.
Please see these requests to allow for the building of our small shed. I appreciate
your time. Thank you.
