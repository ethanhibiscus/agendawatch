They are currently two to three months behind the planned schedule and little progress has been 
made since the last update.  The background section is substantially done.  They are reviewing 
comments to date to determine if there are appropriate comments to resolve in the first part which 
will need review by a technical editor before being released as a draft.

Mid-Region Council of Governments of New Mexico 
 
Approval of the 2020 Budget  
 
Action Requested:  Approval of MRCOG’s 2021 Budget.  
 
Action Summary:  The 2021 budget is proposed based on anticipated funding for 
the fiscal year and anticipated expenditures.  The budget provides information as 
to the maintenance of effort necessary to administer the grants and programs, 
and to operate the Mid-Region Council of Governments.    
 
Background:  The 2021 budgeted expenditures total $15,366,371, a decrease of 
$829,771 from the 2020 final budget, and the 2020 budgeted revenues total 
$14,659,384, a decrease of $825,173 from the 2020 final budget.  The reason for 
the decrease is a combination of several changes, the most significant being:   
 
Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP) FHWA – Budget decrease of 
approximately $107,000 is due to additional funding from FHWA provided in 
FY20, which was a one-time increase and will not be carried over to FY21.  
Ortho Digital Photography – The decrease of $102,000 is due to carry over 
from the 2018 project that was included in the 2020 budget.  The carryover was 
due to MRCOG withholding final payment to vendor for the 2018 LiDAR project 
due to inferior product delivered by vendor.       
Rio Metro Operations – Budget increase of $234,000 is due to cost of living 
adjustments.    
Community Adjustment Planning Assistance (OEA Grant) – The decrease of 
$259,660 is due to grant winding down and expected to be fully expended during 
the fall of 2020. 
TechHire Program – The decrease of $422,426 is due to grant winding down 
and expected to be fully expended during the fall of 2020.           
 
Federal Revenues – Budget decrease of approximately $882,000 is related 
primarily to TechHire and OEA Grant revenues decreasing due to grants winding 
down.    
Local Revenues – Budget increase of approximately $223,000 is primarily due 
to the increase in Rio Metro expenditures.    
  
 
Policy Ramification:  Approval of the budget will authorize management to spend 
the funding allocated.      
 
Financial Impact:  The total budgeted expenditures and revenues authorized for 
fiscal year 2021 are $15,366,371 and $14,659,384, respectively.  Decrease in 
fund balance is $706,987.      
As we look toward the “new normal” in fiscal year 2021, we are reminded of the strides we’ve 
made as a region and draw from our past accomplishments. One thing that remains constant is 
our pursuit of an approach in which all of the communities served by the Mid-Region Council of Governments continue 
to thrive and prosper. 
This year is going to be somewhat different from years past due to the pandemic, namely in “how we meet”. Many of us 
have already become pro’s at using Zoom, and other virtual platforms to continue business as usual…while others among 
us (like myself!) will learn to muddle through. One major endeavor we’ve been involved in is the 2020 Census. As much 
as MRCOG is relied on for data collection, we are also well adept at data sharing. And I’m proud to say we have provided 
a wealth of information to support the very important mission of the Census. 
Other key areas of focus include efforts to finish the long-awaited Regional Transportation Management Center which 
will relocate the NM DOT workers who have occupied our basement now for a few years, and make room for expanded 
operations of MRCOG and Rio Metro. Additionally, we look to develop a regional incident management plan to help 
coordinate critical communication in responding to incidents on our State’s roadways. And on the Rural Transportation 
Planning front, we look to provide staff support for maintaining transportation as a means to strengthen and improve 
important health initiatives.
In FY ’21, we will no doubt see the culmination of PTC or Positive Train Control with testing and revenue demonstration 
by the end of 2020. Additionally, we will be monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on our Rio Metro Transit ridership as we 
adjust to these changes in our service and operations accordingly. 
Another key objective is to remain responsive to all requests for planning assistance dollars, as we work to identify the 
need among our member governments and support them in areas of infrastructure planning and asset management 
planning. And speaking of assistance funding, we will work in close concert with our regional economic development 
partners to respond to expected economic injury as a result of the public health crisis that delivered a negative impact for 
which no community could anticipate or prepare.
In the area of Workforce Development Programs, it has never 
been more important – given our current economic outlook – to 
continue to offer training and outreach to both employers and 
job-seekers alike in the Central Region. We also look toward the 
successful completion of our TechHire NM Program as it winds 
down the final year of the partnership grant that has helped 
train and place many job-seekers in well-paying Information 
Technology positions across our region the past four-years. 
So you see, while our outlook is ambitious, we remain confident 
that together we can achieve our goals for the Region as 
we work with our elected officials and member agencies to 
implement a fiscally responsible budget for fiscal year 2021.
