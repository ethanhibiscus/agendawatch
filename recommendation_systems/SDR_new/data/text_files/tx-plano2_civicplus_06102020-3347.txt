A public meeting of the Risk Pool Trustees was called to order by Chairperson Jack Carr on 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 at 10:00 AM in the Executive Conference Room of the Plano 
Municipal Center, 1520 K Avenue.  
Public comments:  There were no public comments. 
Approval of minutes from the November 13, 2019 meeting 
Action:  Shanté Akafia moved to approve the minutes from the November 13, 2019 meeting 
and Shelli Siemer seconded the motion.  The motion was approved and carried 5-0.  
Presentation from RVK 
Jennifer Sandberg with RVK presented the Quarterly Investment Performance Analysis for 
period ended December 31, 2019.  At the November 13, 2019 meeting, RVK reviewed the 
fixed income portfolio and recommended changes to enhance the structure, one being the 
implementation of the PGIM Core Plus Collective Investment Trust (CIT).  Due to client 
representation requirements for 3(c)(11) CITs, Prudential was not able to allow non-
retirement assets into the CIT.  PGIM proposed an alternative investment vehicle, the PGIM 
Core Plus Bond Fund Institutional Business Trust (IBT), which is a commingled fund that 
operates under the same investment strategy and guidelines as the CIT originally proposed 
in November 2019.  Given the similarities between the structures, RVK recommends the IBT 
for investment. 
Action:  Denise Tacke moved to approve RVK’s recommendation to invest in the PGIM 
Core Plus Bond Fund Institutional Business Trust (IBT) subject to satisfactory agreement of 
the terms of the investment and Greg Rushin seconded the motion.  The motion was 
approved and carried 5-0.

Review of the Wells Fargo Bank modifications 
At the November 13, 2019 meeting, Karen Epps with Wells Fargo announced that the 
pension division had been purchased by Principal, and they proposed an agreement that 
would reduce fees.  Andrea Cockrell with Human Resources indicated that the modifications 
were completed prior to the end of 2019.  Wells Fargo is working with Purchasing on the 
contract assignment.   
Update on the benefits’ RFPs 
Andrea Cockrell with Human Resources updated the Trustees on the various RFPs that are 
in the works.  In 2019, life insurance, disability insurance, and the employee assistance 
program (EAP) were bundled together with the provider OneAmerica.  The City has already 
seen a benefit of having migrated the life and disability insurances.  Since 2018, the City has 
been working on the massive RFP for medical third party administrator (TPA) and pharmacy 
benefit manager.  Andrea Cockrell explained the process of the RFP and its current status. 
It should be able to go to council for award in April 2020.  This will allow at least six months 
for implementation.  The dental and vision RFP is scheduled to release in February or March 
of 2020. 
Ratification of payment to Wells Fargo Bank 
Invoice from Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of $10,127.57 dated January 8, 2020 for 
custodial services for the period of October 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 was presented to 
the Trustees for payment. 
Action:  Denise Tacke moved to ratify the payment and Greg Rushin seconded the motion. 
The motion was approved and carried 5-0.

Invoice from RVK, Inc., in the amount of $10,300.00 dated January 1, 2020 for investment 
consulting services for the period of October 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 was presented

2019 Greenwich Quality Leader Award
We are deeply grateful for your continued confidence and support. 
From all of us here at RVK, thank you for the opportunity to serve you!
Greenwich Associates recently announced that RVK is 1 of 3 firms among large US 
consultants to receive the 2019 Greenwich Quality Leader award.
We are proud to announce the 3rd consecutive year of receiving this recognition.
2017
2018
2019
*Between July and October 2019, Greenwich Associates conducted interviews with 1,100 individuals at 896 of the largest tax-exempt funds in the US–including corporate and union funds, public funds, endowments and foundations–with 
either pension or investment pool assets greater than $150 million. Study participants were asked to provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations of their asset managers and investment consultants, including qualitative assessments of
those firms soliciting their business and detailed information on important market trends. RVK is one of three firms recognized in the large investment consultant category. The ratings may not be representative of any one client’s 
experience with RVK; rather they are representative of those clients submitted and that chose to participate in the survey. The results are not indicative of RVK’s future performance.

Key Economic Indicators
The first quarter of 2020 was dramatic as a local outbreak of a previously 
unknown coronavirus in the Hubei Province of China morphed into a global 
pandemic, which led to cases in the millions and casualties in the tens of 
thousands. Governments around the globe closed down huge portions of their 
economies, imposing travel restrictions, cancelling social gatherings, shuttering 
non-essential businesses, and locking down entire cities to reduce the virus’ 
spread. In response, the Federal Reserve announced two emergency rate cuts, 
first by 50 basis points on March 3 and then by 100 basis points on March 16. By 
March 23, the Fed announced open-ended Quantitative Easing alongside a host of 
other liquidity enhancing programs, just as President Trump signed the $2.3 
Trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Securities (CARES) Act into law. 
Markets did not begin heavily discounting the economic risks associated with the 
COVID-19 outbreak until the last week of February. As recently as February 19, 
2020, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high of 3,386. Over the next 3 weeks, the 
S&P 500 closed in bear market territory representing the fastest 20% drawdown 
from an all-time high in the history of the index.

Broad Market
US markets hit their peak in mid-February before growing concerns about the 
spread of COVID-19 caused the S&P 500 to drawdown nearly -34% over the 
remainder of the quarter. However, buoyed by the stimulus provided in the 
CARES Act, the market experienced a 15.5% gain from the trough to end 
Q1.
Market Cap
Small- and mid-cap stocks were hit the hardest by COVID-19 pandemic fears 
with the Russell 2000 and Russell Mid Cap indexes down -30.6% and 
-27.1%, respectively. The Russell 1000 index also ended the quarter down
-20.2%.
Style and Sector
Value underperformed growth across all market capitalizations, experiencing 
a sharper drawdown and slower recovery than growth. In addition, active 
management continued to deliver mixed results in Q1 with approximately 
50% providing excess returns.

Non-US Equity Review
As of March 31, 2020
Developed Markets
Developed international markets fared slightly worse than domestic markets 
during Q1 with broad indexes declining nearly 25%. Sectors were negative 
across the board, but defensive sectors, such as healthcare, consumer 
staples, and utilities held up better amidst the volatility. By region, 
performance was not as diverse as it was by sector, although Japan provided 
investors a measure of safety.
Emerging Markets
For the quarter, emerging markets were the worst performing equity asset 
class, trailing by a thin margin. Emerging markets were negative across 
sectors and countries but the disparity by region was wider than the 
developed world, as there was a flight to perceived quality by country.
Market Cap & Style
In both developed international markets and emerging markets, value stocks 
continued to underperform growth, while large-cap stocks outperformed 
small-cap for the quarter.

Fixed Income Performance (%)
Broad Market
COVID-19-related fears and subsequent monetary policy responses led 
Treasury yields to steep declines of more than 100 basis points across all 
maturities. As of March 9th, the 30-year yield ended at just 0.99%, marking 
the first time ever that all maturities ended below the 1% threshold. 
Credit Market
Credit experienced significant selloffs and volatility over the quarter. In all, the 
Bloomberg US Corporate Index returned -3.6% in Q1 with bifurcated returns 
between quality groups as AAA-rated bonds returned 4.7% while BBB-rated 
bonds returned -7.1%. 
Emerging Market Debt
Emerging market debt suffered from both declining oil prices and coronavirus-
induced reductions in demand. The JPM EMBI Global Diversified Index had 
its worst quarterly decline in more than 20 years, returning -13.4%, worse 
than the total losses experienced in 2008.

Alternatives Review
As of March 31, 2020
General Market - Diversified Inflation Strategies (DIS)
Performance across DIS managers RVK tracks was generally negative 
on an absolute basis during Q1, though there was dispersion among 
strategies driven by exposure differences. In a reversal from 2019, 
managers with larger TIPS allocations tended to outperform peers as 
riskier assets saw relatively large drawdowns during the quarter. 
Managers that underperformed by the widest margins versus peers 
emphasized allocations to REITs, global listed infrastructure and/or 
global natural resource equities in varying proportions.
General Market - Real Estate
Core private real estate returned 0.98% during Q1, as reported by the 
NCREIF-ODCE Index. Total return comprised of a 1.02% gain from 
income with a -0.04% loss due to price appreciation. While the income 
component remained in line with historical levels, price appreciation 
experienced a decrease of -0.51% compared to Q4. Public real estate 
returns trailed private by a wide margin during Q1.
General Market - Hedge Funds
The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index returned -8.3% for the quarter, 
led lower by hedged equity (-13.0%) and event-driven (-15.0%) strategies 
that generally maintain significant net market exposure. Equity Long/Short 
(ELS) managers protected against major capital impairment through strong 
short alpha generation, particularly through bets against stocks in the 
physical retail or travel and leisure sub-sectors.
General Market - Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA)
GTAA managers largely provided negative absolute returns during the 
quarter with long-biased strategies generally underperforming a static and 
less diversified blend of 60% US equity and 40% US fixed income. Strategies 
that provided the weakest relative returns versus peers tended to have higher 
relative allocations to emerging markets equities or exposure to oil markets 
and US small-cap equities. Long-biased managers that outperformed peers 
on a relative basis tended to have more exposure across US markets as 
opposed to emerging markets, both within fixed income and equities.

Glossary
Active Return - The difference between the investment manager/composite performance relative to the performance of an appropriate market 
benchmark.
Active Share - Measures the degree to which the holdings of a fund differ from the holdings of the benchmark. Active share is calculated by taking the 
sum of the absolute value of the differences of the weight of each holding in the fund versus the weight of each holding in the benchmark and dividing by 
two.
Alpha - A measure of the difference between a portfolio's actual returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by beta. It is a 
measure of the portfolio's historical performance not explained by movements of the market or a portfolio's non-systematic return.
Alpha Ratio - A measure of a portfolio's non-systematic return per unit of downside risk. It is measured by dividing the alpha of a portfolio by the 
downside risk. The non-systematic return is a measure of a portfolio's historical performance not explained by movements of the market.
Average Quality - Bond quality ratings are reported using the investment managers' and the index providers' preferred rating agency. Average Quality 
for managers unable to provide this statistic is instead provided by Morningstar; if unavailable on Morningstar, it has been estimated using a credit 
quality distribution provided by the manager. There are two primary rating agencies in the US. Moody's assigns ratings on a system that employs up to 
four symbols (consisting of letters and numbers) such as, Aaa, Aa2, etc., with Aaa being the highest or safest rating. Standard & Poor's (S&P) employs a 
system that uses + and - along with letters such as AAA, AA+, etc. The two rating agencies' systems are summarized below:

Benchmark Effect - The difference between the blended return of each respective managers’ benchmark within a composite and the composite’s 
benchmark return.
Beta - A measure of the sensitivity of a portfolio to the movements in the market. It is a measure of a portfolio's non-diversifiable or systematic risk.
Box Plots - A graphical representation of the distribution of observations. From top to bottom, the four boxes represent the spread between the 
maximum value and the minimum value in each quartile. A quartile represents the values that divide the observations into four quarters (i.e., 1st quartile, 
2nd quartile, 3rd quartile, and 4th quartile). The median observation is where the 2nd quartile and 3rd quartile meet.
Buy and Hold Attribution - At the beginning of the time period under analysis, the manager and benchmark portfolios are broken down into segments 
(i.e., styles, sectors, countries, and regions) based on the desired type of attribution. The formula assumes zero turn-over to the manager and 
benchmark portfolios throughout the period and calculates the segment returns ("buy and hold returns") to arrive at performance attribution. Due to 
portfolio turnover, buy and hold attribution may not accurately represent quarterly performance relative to the benchmark. Country, region, sector, and 
style allocations are as of the date one quarter prior to the reporting date, and the returns shown are for those segments throughout the quarter reported. 
Due to disclosure guidelines set by each investment manager, equity characteristics shown are as of the most recent date available. The following is the 
methodology for segment classification:
Sector - Attribution is calculated using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) which is a detailed and comprehensive structure for sector 
and industry analysis. Stocks are classified by their primary sector, as defined by S&P Capital IQ data.
Country/Region - Attribution is calculated using the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) region standards. Stocks are classified by their 
domicile country/region, as defined by S&P Capital IQ data. 
Style - Stocks are classified into the following style boxes: large/mid/small vs. growth/neutral/value. Stocks are classified along large/mid/small 
categories at the time of the Russell index rebalancing, using the index market cap boundaries as cutoff points. Stocks are classified along 
growth/neutral/value categories at the time of the Russell index rebalancing, using the price/book ratio as supplied by S&P Capital IQ. Stocks in the 
Russell 3000 Index portfolio are sorted by price/book ratio; names with the highest price/book ratio that make up 1/3 of the total market capitalization 
are assigned to the growth category, names that make up the subsequent 1/3 of the total market capitalization are assigned to the neutral category, 
while the balance of the names are assigned to the value category. Stocks are unclassified when there is not enough data to determine a size and 
style metric.
Portfolio Characteristics and Buy and Hold Attribution reports utilize product-specific data for all mutual funds and commingled funds.
Capital Markets Review -
Breakeven Inflation - Measures the expected inflation rate at each stated maturity by taking the difference between the real yield of the inflation-
linked maturity curve and the yield of the closest nominal Treasury maturity.
Consumer Confidence - Measures domestic consumer confidence as defined by the degree of optimism on the state of the economy that 
consumers express through saving and spending.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Measures the change in the price level of consumer goods and services.
Federal Funds Rate - The interest rate at which a depository institution lends funds maintained at the Federal Reserve to another depository 
institution overnight. It is one of the most influential interest rates in the US economy, since it affects monetary and financial conditions, which in turn 
have a bearing on key aspects of the broad economy including employment, growth and inflation.

Glossary
Option-Adjusted Spread - Measures the flat spread of an index or bond to the Treasury yield curve after removing the effect of any embedded        
options.
Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) - Measures economic activity by surveying purchasing managers on a monthly basis as to whether business 
conditions have improved, worsened, or stayed the same.
Real Gross Domestic Product (Real GDP) - An inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy 
in a given year.
US Dollar Total Weighted Index - Measures the value of the US Dollar relative to a basket of other world currencies. It is calculated as the weighted 
geometric mean of the dollar's value versus the EUR, GBP, CAD, SEK, CHF, and JPY.
Unemployment Rate - The percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment.
VIX - Measures the implied volatility of S&P 500 Index options by looking at the market's expectation of the S&P 500 Index volatility over the next 30 
day period. Commonly referred to as the "fear index" or the "fear gauge."
Cash Flow Effect – The composite’s active return minus the sum of each managers’ active return minus the benchmark effect.
Consistency - The percentage of quarters that a product achieved a rate of return higher than that of its benchmark. The higher the consistency figure, 
the more value a manager has contributed to the product's performance.
Convexity - A measure of the shape of the curve that describes the relationship between bond prices and bond yields.
Correlation - A statistical measure of the relationship between asset class returns. A value of 1.00 is a perfect correlation; that is, the asset classes 
always move in the same direction. A value of -1.00 indicates a perfect negative correlation, in which the asset classes always move in opposite 
directions of each other. A value of 0 indicates there is no relationship between the direction of returns of the two asset classes.  Correlation calculations 
only consider the direction of changes relative to two variables and not the magnitude of those changes.
Coupon Rate - The percentage rate of interest paid on a bond or fixed income security; it is typically paid twice per year.
Current Yield - The annual income of a security divided by the security's current price.
Down Market Capture - Down market by definition is negative benchmark return and down market capture represents the ratio in % terms of the 
average portfolios return over the benchmark during the down market period. The lower the value of the down market capture the better the product's 
performance.
Downside Risk - A measure similar to standard deviation, but focuses only on the negative movements of the return series. It is calculated by taking the 
standard deviation of the negative returns for the selected periodicity. The higher the factor, the riskier the product.
Earnings Per Share - It is backward looking, calculated using the one year current EPS divided by the one year EPS five years ago.
Effective Duration - The approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in yield.
Excess Return vs. Market - Average of the monthly arithmetic difference between the manager's return and the benchmark return over a specified time 
period, shown on an annualized basis.
Excess Return vs. Risk Free - Average of the monthly arithmetic difference between the manager's return and the risk-free return (i.e., ICE BofAML 3 
Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise) over a specified time period, shown on an annualized basis.
Excess Risk - A measure of the standard deviation of a portfolio's performance relative to the risk free return.
Expense Ratios - Morningstar is the source for mutual fund expense ratios.  
Gain/Loss - The net increase or decrease in the market value of a portfolio excluding its Net Cash Flow for a given period.
Indices - All indices and related information are considered intellectual property and are licensed by each index provider. The indices may not be 
copied, used or distributed without the index provider's prior written approval. Index providers make no warranties and bear no liability with respect to the 
indices, any related data, their quality, accuracy, suitability and/or completeness.  
Information Ratio - Measured by dividing the active rate of return by the tracking error. The higher the information ratio, the more value-added 
contribution by the manager.
Liability Driven Investing (LDI) - A method to optimally structure asset investments relative to liabilities. The change in liabilities is estimated by the 
Ryan Labs Generic PPA Index of appropriate duration for that Plan. This benchmark is based on generic data and is therefore an approximation. RVK is 
not an actuarial firm, and does not have actuarial expertise.
Estimated Funded Status - The estimated ratio of a Plan's assets relative to its future liabilities. This is calculated by dividing the Plan's asset market 
value by the estimated present value of its liabilities. The higher the estimated funded status, the better the Plan's ability to cover its projected benefit 
obligations. An estimated funded status of 100% indicates a Plan that is fully funded.
Estimated PV of Liabilities - An estimate of a Plan's future liabilities in present value terms. The beginning of the period liability is provided by the 
Plan's actuary. The period-end present value liability estimate provided in this report is derived by applying the estimated percentage change 
generated using the Ryan Labs Generic PPA Index with duration similar to that reported on the most recent actuarial valuation report.
Duration of Liabilities - The sensitivity of the value of a Plan's liabilities to changes in interest rates, as calculated by the Plan's actuary.
Duration of Assets - The dollar-weighted average duration of all the individual Plan assets.
Estimated Plan Hedge Ratio - The estimate of how well a Plan's investment portfolio is hedged against changes in interest rates - a primary driver of 
funded status movements. This is calculated by dividing the dollar-weighted values of both the Plan asset duration by the liability duration and 
multiplying by the estimated funded status. An estimated plan hedge ratio of zero indicates that the Plan's liabilities have not been hedged, whereas a 
value of one indicates fully hedged.

Glossary
Modified Duration - The approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in yield, assuming the bonds’ expected cash 
flows do not change.
Mutual Fund Performance - Whenever possible, manager performance is extended for any share class that does not have 10 years of history. Using 
Morningstar’s methodology, a single ticker within the same fund family (often the oldest share class) is chosen to append historical performance.
Net Cash Flow - The sum, in dollars, of a portfolio's contributions and withdrawals. This includes all management fees and expenses only when 
performance shown is gross of fees.
Peer Groups -
Plan Sponsor Peer Groups - RVK utilizes the Mellon Analytical Solutions Trust Universe along with the Investment Metrics Plan Sponsor Universe. 
The combined Mellon Analytical Solutions Trust Universe and Investment Metrics Plan Sponsor Universe is used for comparison of total fund 
composite results and utilizes actual client performance compiled from consultant and custodian data. The Plan Sponsor Peer Group database 
includes performance and other quantitative data for over 2,100 plans which include corporate, endowment, foundation, public, and Taft Hartley plans. 
Plan Sponsor Peer Groups are gross of fees.
Investment Manager Peer Groups - RVK utilizes Investment Metrics’ Peer Groups for investment manager peer comparison and ranking. The 
Investment Metrics Peer Group database includes performance and other quantitative data for over 840 investment management firms and 29,000 
investments products, across more than 160 standard peer groups. Mutual Fund Peer Groups are net of fees. 
Percentile Rankings - Percentile rank compares an individual fund's performance with those of other funds within a defined peer group of managers 
possessing a similar investment style. Percentile rank identifies the percentage of a fund's peer group that has a higher return (or other comparative 
measurement) than the fund being ranked. Conversely, 100 minus the individual fund's ranking will identify the percentage of funds within the peer group 
that have a lower return than the fund being ranked.
1 - Highest Statistical Value
100 - Lowest Statistical Value
Example: American Funds AMCP;R-4 (RAFEX) is ranked in the 4th percentile within the IM US Equity Large-Cap Growth Funds (MF) Peer Group for the 
Sharpe Ratio. Within the IM US Equity Large-Cap Growth Funds peer group, 4% of the other funds performed better than American Funds AMCP;R-4 
(RAFEX), while 96% of the funds performed worse.
Performance Methodology - RVK calculates performance for investment managers and composites using different methodologies. 
Investment Managers - Performance is calculated for interim periods between all large external cash flows for a given month and geometrically 
linked to calculate period returns. An external cash flow is defined as cash, securities, or assets that enter or exit a portfolio. RVK defines a "large 
cash flow" as a net aggregate cash flow of ≥10% of the beginning-period portfolio market value or any cash flow that causes RVK calculated 
performance to deviate from manager/custodian reported performance in excess of 5 basis points for a given month.
Composites - The Modified Dietz methodology is utilized to calculate asset class, sub-asset class, and total fund composite performance. The 
Modified Dietz method calculates a time-weighted total rate of return that considers the timing of external cash flows; however, it does not utilize 
interim period performance to mitigate the impact of significant cash in- and outflows to the composite.
RVK calculates performance beginning with the first full month following inception. Since inception performance may vary from manager reported 
performance due to RVK using the first full month of returns as the inception date. Performance for both managers and composites is annualized for 
periods greater than one year.
Portfolio Characteristics - Due to disclosure guidelines set by each investment manager, portfolio characteristics shown are as of the most recent date 
available.
Price to Earnings Ratio - The ratio of a company’s share price to its per-share earnings
Private Equity Quartile Ranks - Private Equity quartile ranks are generated using vintage year peer group data provided by Thomson Reuters, and are 
based on each fund’s annualized, since inception internal rate of return (IRR). Three Private Equity peer groups are available via Thomson Reuters: 
Buyout, Venture, and All Private Equity. Ranks are available quarterly, at a one-quarter lag. 
Return - Compounded rate of return for the period.
% Return - The time-weighted rate of return of a portfolio for a given period.
R-Squared - The percentage of a portfolio's performance explained by the behavior of the appropriate benchmark. High R-Squared means a higher 
correlation of the portfolio's performance to the appropriate benchmark.
Risk Free Benchmark – ICE BofAML 3 Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise.

Sector Allocation - Negative fixed income sector allocation reflects manager’s use of derivatives, short selling, or interest rate swaps.
Sharpe Ratio - Represents the excess rate of return over the risk-free return (i.e., ICE BofAML 3 Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise), divided 
by the standard deviation of the excess return to the risk free asset. The result is the absolute rate of return per unit of risk. The higher the value, the 
better the product's historical risk-adjusted performance.
Simple Alpha - The difference between the manager's return and the benchmark's return.
Spread Duration - The approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in its spread over a Treasury of the same 
maturity.
Standard Deviation - A statistical measure of the range of a portfolio's performance. The variability of a return around its average return over a specified 
time period.
Time Period Abbreviations - QTD - Quarter-to-Date. CYTD - Calendar Year-to-Date. FYTD - Fiscal Year-to-Date. YOY - Year Over Year.

Total Fund Attribution – The Investment Decision Process (IDP) model provides an approach to evaluating investment performance that applies to all 
asset classes and investment styles. The IDP model is based on a top-down hierarchy framework of investment decisions, with each decision 
contributing to the overall profit or loss. The IDP approach starts from the strategic asset allocation and follows the flow of the investments down to the 
manager’s skill. 
Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) – The percentage return gained or lost from the long-term strategic asset allocation decision, the most significant 
determinant of long-term performance. SAA is the product of the target asset allocation multiplied by the corresponding benchmark returns. 
Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) – The percentage return gained or lost from not having been precisely allocated at the target asset allocation mix, 
whether by deviations that are tactical in nature or a by-product of moving towards the target mix. TAA is the product of the actual asset allocation 
multiplied by the broad asset class benchmarks, less the SAA. 
Style Selection (SS) – The percentage return gained or lost from intentional style biases within each asset class (e.g. value rather than core or 
overweight to emerging markets relative to benchmark). SS is the product of the actual manager allocation within each asset class multiplied by their 
specific benchmark, less TAA. 
Manager’s Skill (MS) – The percentage return gained or lost from manager value added relative to their specific benchmark. MS is the product of the 
actual manager allocation multiplied by their achieved excess return.
Total Fund Beta - Total Fund Beta is calculated using the S&P 500 as the benchmark. It represents a measure of the sensitivity of the total fund to 
movements in the S&P 500 and is a measure of the Total Fund's non-diversifiable or systematic risk.  
Tracking Error - A measure of the standard deviation of a portfolio's performance relative to the performance of an appropriate market benchmark.
Page 49
Glossary
Treynor Ratio - Similar to Sharpe ratio, but focuses on beta rather than excess risk (standard deviation). Treynor ratio represents the excess rate of 
return over the risk-free rate (i.e., ICE BofAML 3 Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise) divided by the beta. The result is the absolute rate of 
return per unit of risk. The higher the value, the better historical risk-adjusted performance.
Unit Value - The dollar value of a portfolio, assuming an initial nominal investment of $100, growing at the compounded rate of %Return for a given 
period.
Up Market Capture - Up market by definition is positive benchmark return and up market capture represents the ratio in % terms of the average 
portfolios return over the benchmark during the up market period. The higher the value of the up market capture the better the product's performance.
Yield to Maturity - The rate of return achieved on a bond or other fixed income security assuming the security is bought and held to maturity and that 
the coupon interest paid over the life of the bond will be reinvested at the same rate of return. The 30-Day SEC Yield is similar to the Yield to Maturity 
and is reported for mutual funds. 
Yield to Worst - The bond yield calculated by using the worst possible yield taking into consideration all call, put, and optional sink dates.

General Market Commentary
Equity markets posted positive returns in April as the S&P 500 (Cap Wtd) Index returned 12.82% and 
the MSCI EAFE (Net) Index returned 6.46%. Emerging markets returned 9.16% as measured by the 
MSCI EM (Net) Index.
The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index returned 1.78% in April, outperforming the 0.27% return by 
the Bloomberg US Treasury Intermediate Term Index. International fixed income markets returned 
1.51%, as measured by the FTSE Non-US World Gov't Bond Index.
Public real estate, as measured by the FTSE NAREIT Eq REITs Index (TR), returned 8.30% in April 
and 2.41% over the trailing five-year period.
The Cambridge US Private Equity Index returned 7.76% for the trailing one-year period and 11.68% for 
the trailing five-year period ending September 2019.
Absolute return strategies, as measured by the HFRI FOF Comp Index, returned 3.64% for the month 
and -2.92% over the trailing one-year period.
Due to a continued supply glut in crude oil, prices for oil with May delivery briefly dropped below zero for 
the first time in history as oil inventories approached capacity.  Prices plunged over 300% in one day, 
though prices stabilized as oil settled at $18.84 per barrel at the end of April.  
Global Equity markets recovered significant Q1 losses during April, as broad global equities returned 
roughly 11% during the month.  Stocks recovered on news of stronger-than-expected corporate 
earnings, increased optimism of countries and US states reopening segments of their economies, and 
in the US – additional monetary and fiscal stimulus to aid businesses and financial markets.
Amidst increased optimism, signs of economic and financial market challenges still persist.  In the US, it 
is estimated that 30.3 million Americans filed unemployment claims from the middle of March through 
the end of April as businesses have laid off or furloughed employees as companies struggle to make 
payrolls.  Unemployment and loss of income has predictably had a large negative impact on the 
economy at large as US GDP fell 4.8% during Q1 with economists predicting a further decline in Q2.

Asset Allocation Review 
City of Plano Other Post-Employment Benefits 
Trust 
June 10, 2020
Introduction
Background:
RVK conducted an asset allocation review for the City of Plano Other Post-Employment Benefits 
Trust (“OPEB”) to review the current target asset allocation with respect to the Plan’s objectives 
and RVK’s updated Capital Markets Assumptions. 
Investment Objective: The investment objective for the Trust is to achieve an average annual rate 
of return equal to or greater than the annual rate of return of 6.75% for the aggregate investments 
over an evaluation period of three to five years or a full market cycle.
Risk/Return Profile: Capital Appreciation and growth.

Process Overview
Asset Allocation Study Overview
Introduction to Asset Allocation Studies:
Selecting an asset allocation is one of the most important investment decisions a fiduciary can make.
There are two steps to the asset allocation decision: 
1.
Identification of the asset classes to be considered 
2.
Selection of the portfolio mix that best meets plan objectives
Asset allocation studies help us to examine how well alternative investment strategies (i.e., differing asset 
allocations) address the objectives of a fund.

Illustrative Example
Capital Markets Assumptions
•
Each year, RVK reviews the capital market environment and updates our long-
term, forward-looking capital markets assumptions (“CMAs”) for each asset class 
used by our clients.
•
Annual updates are typically gradual and incorporate historical performance, 
current valuations, as well as the overall economic environment.
•
As a result of significant changes to interest rates, equity valuations and inflation 
expectations, we have updated our long-term forecasts as of Q1 2020.
•
The forecast horizon is for long-term periods over multiple market cycles, typically 
10 years or more.
•
The components we estimate include:
–
Return
–
Risk (volatility of returns)
–
Correlation (relationship of asset class returns with all other asset classes)
•
Return assumptions are generally index based and assume no investment 
manager alpha.
Page 5
What does it mean to get CM Assumptions “right”?
Relative accuracy is most important…
•
Relative Accuracy: Assumptions capture the relative relationships between 
asset classes – particularly closely related ones.
–
Having some assumptions that are spot on and others that are far off will 
produce unbalanced and poorly diversified portfolios. 
But “absolute” accuracy matters too—just not as much.
•
Absolute Accuracy: Assumptions reflect the absolute values actually 
experienced in future long-term market environments.
–
Having CM assumptions that are too high or too low across the board can cause 
a Fund to believe it can spend more than it can afford or restrict spending more 
than necessary.

Asset Allocation Process
Page 10
Mean Variance Optimization (MVO) – Background
Using inputs of expected return, volatility, and correlation, MVO enables investors to identify 
combinations of distinct asset class allocations that maximize portfolio returns for a given level of 
risk. 
MVO Benefits
•
Introduces the critical concept of diversification, which encourages investors to avoid 
concentrating risk in a small subset of assets or asset classes, especially closely related (highly-
correlated) ones.
•
Focuses portfolio management activities on asset allocation, which is the most important driver 
of overall portfolio risk and return.
•
Provides a powerful quantitative tool to identify distinct asset allocation targets that have the 
most optimal risk/return tradeoffs.
MVO Shortcomings
•
Simplified assumption of risk/return trade-off fails to capture fully how real world investors 
weight gains versus losses (i.e., do losses matter more than gains?)
•
Volatility is viewed as the only proxy for risk.
•
Correlation is treated as static rather than dynamic.
•
Models are sometimes highly sensitive to small changes to input values (“robustness”).
•
Unconstrained output yields highly concentrated portfolios rather than the expected 
diversification.

Observations:
•
Portfolio is focused on growth (capital appreciation), with allocation to capital preservation and inflation 
hedging assets for diversification benefits. 
•
Maintains a strong base of stable, liquid assets to meet spending requirements.
•
The current asset allocation has a 47% probability of achieving 6.75% over a three-year horizon. 
•
The current target asset allocation is expected to contribute to meeting long-term cash flow needs for 
OPEB. RVK recommends maintaining the current target allocation.

Monte Carlo Analysis:
•
Monte Carlo analysis simulates thousands of market scenarios (i.e. different asset returns, 
yields, growth and inflation assumptions), all via random sampling based on empirical market 
data.
•
Portfolios derived from our proprietary Capital Markets Assumptions are then modeled against 
these random economic scenarios to create a range of probable return outcomes given a 
specific asset allocation.

Actuarial computations presented in this report under Statements No. 74 and 75 of the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board are for purposes of assisting the Plan in fulfilling its financial accounting
requirements. No attempt is being made to offer any accounting opinion or advice. This report is for the
employer's fiscal year ending September 30, 2020. The measurement date for determining plan assets and
obligations is December 31, 2019. The calculations enclosed in this report have been made on a basis
consistent with our understanding of the plan provisions. Determinations for purposes other than meeting
financial reporting requirements may be significantly different from the results contained in this report.
Accordingly, additional determinations may be needed for other purposes, such as judging benefit security or
meeting employer funding requirements.  
Future actuarial measurements may differ significantly from the current measurements presented in this
report due to factors such as, but not limited to, the following: plan experience differing from that anticipated
by the economic or demographic assumptions; changes in economic or demographic assumptions;
increases or decreases expected as part of the natural operation of the methodology used for these
measurements (such as the end of an amortization period or additional cost or contribution requirements
based on the plan’s funded status); and changes in plan provisions or applicable law. Due to the limited
scope of the actuarial assignment, we did not perform an analysis of the potential range of such future

purposes. Milliman does not intend to benefit and assumes no duty or liability to other parties who receive this work. Milliman
recommends that third parties be aided by their own actuary or other qualified professional when reviewing the Milliman work product.
In preparing this report, we relied, without audit, on information as of October 1, 2019 furnished by the Plan.
This information includes, but is not limited to, statutory provisions, member census data, and financial
information. The membership as of October 1, 2019 includes 2,278 active participants, 902 retirees and
surviving spouses, and 53 spouses of current retirees.  
We performed a limited review of the census and financial information used directly in our analysis and have
found them to be reasonably consistent and comparable with information used for other purposes. The
valuation results depend on the integrity of this information.
If any of this information is inaccurate or
incomplete, our results may be different and our calculations may need to be revised.  
We hereby certify that, to the best of our knowledge, this report, including all costs and liabilities based on
actuarial assumptions and methods, is complete and accurate and determined in conformance with generally
recognized and accepted actuarial principles and practices, which are consistent with the Actuarial Standards
of Practice promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board and the applicable Code of Professional Conduct,
amplifying Opinions and supporting Recommendations of the American Academy of Actuaries.
This valuation report is only an estimate of the plan's financial condition as of a single date. It can neither
predict the plan's future condition nor guarantee future financial soundness. Actuarial valuations do not
affect the ultimate cost of plan benefits, only the timing of plan contributions. While the valuation is based on
an array of individually reasonable assumptions, other assumption sets may also be reasonable and
valuation results based on those assumptions would be different. No one set of assumptions is uniquely
correct.  Determining results using alternative assumptions is outside the scope of our engagement.

GASB 75 governs the specifics of accounting for public OPEB plan obligations for participating employers
and is required to be implemented for employer fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2017. GASB 75
requires a liability for OPEB obligations, known as the Net OPEB Liability, to be recognized on the balance
sheets of participating employers. Changes in the Net OPEB Liability will be immediately recognized as
OPEB Expense on the income statement or reported as deferred inflows/outflows of resources depending on
the nature of the change.
GASB 74 applies to financial reporting for public OPEB plans and is required to be implemented for plan
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2016. Note that a plan's fiscal year might not be the same as the
employer's fiscal year.
Even if the plan does not issue standalone financial statements, but rather is
considered a trust fund of a government, it is subject to GASB 74. Under GASB 74, enhancements to the
financial statement disclosures are required, along with certain required supplementary information.
The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released new accounting standards for public
postemployment benefit plans other than pension (OPEB) and participating employers in 2015.
These
standards, GASB Statements No. 74 and 75, have substantially revised the accounting requirements
previously mandated under GASB Statements No. 43 and 45. The most notable changes are that the
Annual Required Contribution (ARC) has been eliminated and that the Net OPEB Liability will be an item on
the employer's financial statement rather than a footnote entry.

The employer pre-funds benefits through contributions to the trust. The current funding policy is to contribute
the Actuarially Determined Contribution as calculated by the actuary. The Actuarially Determined Contribution
is the sum of the current year's normal cost plus an amount necessary to amortize the unfunded liability over
a closed 17-year period. The following actuarial methods and assumptions were used to calculate the
January 1, 2020 Actuarially Determined Contribution.

The money-weighted rate of return considers the changing amounts actually invested during a period and
weights the amount of plan investments by the proportion of time they are available to earn a return during
that period. External cash flows are determined on a monthly basis and are assumed to occur at the middle
of each month. External cash inflows are netted with external cash outflows, resulting in a net external cash
flow in each month.  The money-weighted rate of return is calculated net of investment expenses.

The best-estimate range for the long-term expected rate of return is determined by adding expected inflation
to expected long-term real returns and reflecting expected volatility and correlation. The capital market
assumptions are per Milliman's investment consulting practice as of December 31, 2019.

City of Plano Retiree Medical Plan
The Actuarially Determined Contribution is based on a closed amortization period, which
means that payment of the Actuarially Determined Contribution each year will bring the plan to 
a 100% funded position by the end of the amortization period.
GASB 74 and 75 specify that the projections regarding future solvency assume that plan
assets earn the assumed rate of return and there are no future changes in the plan provisions
or actuarial methods and assumptions, which means that the projections would not reflect any
adverse future experience which might impact the plan’s funded position
Based on these circumstances, it is our professional opinion that the detailed depletion date projections
outlined in GASB 74 and 75 will show that the Fiduciary Net Position is always projected to be sufficient to
cover benefit payments and administrative expenses.
This work product was prepared solely for the Plan for the purposes described herein and may not be appropriate to use for other
purposes. Milliman does not intend to benefit and assumes no duty or liability to other parties who receive this work. Milliman
recommends that third parties be aided by their own actuary or other qualified professional when reviewing the Milliman work product.
GASB 74 and 75 generally require that a blended discount rate be used to measure the Total OPEB Liability
(the Actuarial Accrued Liability calculated using the Individual Entry Age Normal Cost Method). The long-term
expected return on plan investments may be used to discount liabilities to the extent that the plan’s Fiduciary
Net Position (fair market value of assets) is projected to cover benefit payments and administrative
expenses. A 20-year tax-exempt municipal bond yield or index rate must be used for periods where the
Fiduciary Net Position is not projected to cover benefit payments and administrative expenses. Determining
the discount rate under GASB 74 and 75 will often require that the actuary perform complex projections of
future benefit payments and asset values. GASB 74 and 75 (paragraph 29) do allow for alternative
evaluations of projected solvency, if such evaluation can reliably be made. GASB does not contemplate a
specific method for making an alternative evaluation of sufficiency; it is left to professional judgment. 
The City of Plano has at least a 5-year history of paying at least 100% of the Actuarially
Determined Contribution (previously termed the Annual Required Contribution).

The total OPEB liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of the valuation date, calculated based
on the discount rate and actuarial assumptions below, and was then projected forward to the measurement
date.    Any significant changes during this period have been reflected as prescribed by GASB 74 and 75.
The plan has not had a formal actuarial experience study performed.
The plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments
of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the discount rate for calculating the total OPEB liability
is equal to the long-term expected rate of return.

GASB 74 and 75 Disclosure for Employer’s Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 2020  
Page A-2 
City of Plano Retiree Medical Plan 
 
The actuarial cost method determines, in a systematic way, the incidence of plan sponsor contributions required 
to provide plan benefits.  It also determines how actuarial gains and losses are recognized in OPEB costs.  
These gains and losses result from the difference between the actual experience under the plan and what was 
anticipated by the actuarial assumptions. 
The cost of the Plan is derived by making certain specific assumptions as to rates of interest, mortality, turnover, 
etc., which are assumed to hold for many years into the future. Since actual experience may differ somewhat 
from the long term assumptions, the costs determined by the valuation must be regarded as estimates of the 
true costs of the Plan. 
Actuarial liabilities and comparative costs shown in this report were computed using the Entry Age Normal 
Actuarial Cost Method, which consists of the following cost components: 
 The Normal Cost is the Actuarial Present Value of benefits allocated to the valuation year. 
 The Actuarial Accrued Liability is the Actuarial Present Value of benefits accrued as of the 
valuation date. 
 Valuation Assets are equal to the market value of assets, if any, as of the valuation date. 
 Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability is the difference between the Actuarial Accrued Liability 
and the Valuation Assets.  Each new base is amortized over the maximum permissible period under 
GASB 74/75 of 15 years. 
It should be noted that GASB 74/75 requires this cost method to be used.

GASB 74 and 75 Disclosure for Employer’s Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 2020  
Page A-3 
City of Plano Retiree Medical Plan 
In addition to the actuarial method used, actuarial cost estimates depend to an important degree on the 
assumptions made relative to various occurrences, such as rate of expected investment earnings by the fund, 
rates of mortality among active and retired employees, rates of termination from employment, and retirement 
rates.  In the current valuation, the actuarial assumptions used for the calculation of costs and liabilities are as 
follows:

Benefit liabilities are valued as of October 1, 2019 and measured as of December 31, 2019.  
Discount Rate for Valuing Liabilities 
6.75% per annum, compounded annually

Healthcare Specific Assumptions 
 
Reliance and Limitations:
 In performing this analysis, we relied on data and other information provided by the City of Plano.  We have not audited or 
verified this data and other information.
We performed a limited review of the data used in our analysis for reasonableness and consistency and have not found 
material defects in the data.  If there are material defects in the data, it is possible that they would be uncovered by a 
detailed, systemic review and comparison of the data to search for data values that are questionable or for relationships 
that are materially inconsistent.  Such a review was beyond the scope of our assignment.  
If the underlying data or information is inaccurate or incomplete, the results of our analysis may likewise be inaccurate or 
incomplete. It is important to note, this list includes but is not necessarily limited to the following:
   (1) Retiree Census File.
   (2) Medical and Dental Plan Designs to all current retirees and dependents.
   (3) Retiree Premium Equivalent Rates (both the employer and employee amounts).
Differences between our projections and actual amounts depend on the extent to which future experience conforms to the 
assumptions made for this analysis.  It is certain that actual experience will not conform exactly to the assumptions used 
in this analysis.  Actual amounts will differ from projected amounts to the extent that actual experience deviates from 
expected experience.  
This report has been prepared solely for the internal business use of and is only to be relied upon by the management of  
City of Plano.

Key Assumptions:
(1) Valuation Date: 10/01/2019
(2) Trend was calculated assuming an implied inflation rate of 2.5% per year and actual premiums.  The short-term
trend rate starts off at 4.0% and reflects the repeal of the ACA Excise Tax.
(3) We conservatively assumed no stop-loss recoveries for retirees.
(4) The plan excluded any Medicare eligible Post-65 benefits
Methodology:
(1) Claim costs are calculated using manual rates and experience.
(2) Actual medical and dental administrative expenses were not provided.  Therefore, we assumed a medical and 
dental load of 15%.
(3) Any Medicare Part D subsidy was not reflected in our estimate.
(4) Claim Costs were calculated for retirees assuming the current plan enrollment of each retiree.  If the mix of plan 
designs elected should change materially then the per capita costs reflected herein may also change materially.

Tests

Individuals with a Positive Test Result
There are 7 known coronaviruses (including COVID-19) that infect humans, including some that cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the 
common cold.  COVID-19 is a novel corona virus, meaning it is a new strain. Because it is new, there was no COVID-19 specific diagnosis code available 
for providers to use. New codes were approved for diagnosing confirmed COVID-19 cases beginning April 1, 2020. In the interim, the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) directed providers to use the non-specific coronavirus code B97.29 that was historically used to report on non-COVID-19 
coronaviruses. The interim B97.29 code is not conclusive for a COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-related codes have been grouped together based upon the 
likelihood of a positive diagnosis and are presented within this report. Reporting of COVID-19 cases may be understated for several reasons:
•
Test results are not be available for all platforms or members
•
Testing may be limited due to limited test kit availability
•
Testing and diagnosis may be understated due to provider coding and billing processes
•
Claims may be submitted with a presenting diagnosis (e.g. 'respiratory illness') and may not include any diagnosis directly related to COVID
•
Reporting is based on claim experience and does not account for members who do not seek medical care
•
Reporting is based on claim experience and may not account for tests processed by CDC or State Health Departments
•
Claims with newer coding may be pended while reimbursement logic is updated and will not appear in this report until holds are released.
•
Reporting by day and week will be understated as claims for most recent services may not have yet processed.
