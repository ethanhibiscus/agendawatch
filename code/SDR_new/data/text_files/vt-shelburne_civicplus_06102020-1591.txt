Findings:  
 
“The meeting agenda includes an item relating to the discussing of conservation projects.  The 
SNRCC’s charge includes making recommendations to the Selectboard regarding use of the Open 
Space to purchase land or rights in land. 
 
“Discussions involving potential land acquisition can be and often are complex, time consuming, and 
sensitive to outside influences. I believe others on the SNRCC would agree. I wish therefore to 
make two motions. The first provides justification for entering executive session, while the second, 
if approved, would cause the group to enter executive session.” 
 
 
1st MOTION 
“I move that the minutes show that SNRCC has made a finding that premature general public 
knowledge would place the public body or a person involved at a substantial disadvantage. 1 V.S.A. 
§ 313(a)(1).” 
 
2nd MOTION 
“I move that the SNRCC enter executive session for the purpose of discussing a matter involving 
negotiation and/or securing real estate purchase or lease options, as authorized by 1 V.S.A. § 
313(a)(2).”
