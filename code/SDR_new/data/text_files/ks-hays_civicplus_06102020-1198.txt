4. NON-PUBLIC HEARING ITEMS:   
 
A. Set a Public Hearing for a request by Dustin and Laney Roths, owners of  
Roths Luxury Properties LLC requesting a special use permit for a place of 
public assembly at 1102 Main Street: 
 
     Jesse Rohr provided the power point presentation for the above. He explained 
that they were only setting a public hearing at this meeting and he will provide as 
much information as he can.

     The owners purchased this property with intentions of remodeling the interior 
and opening a place of public assembly for activities.  This property is in the “C-3” 
Central Business District that would require a special use permit for this type of 
use in this district as he pointed out on the table 2.2.203 from the Unified 
Development Code.   
 
       He pointed out to keep in mind the following:  That within the “C-3” zoning 
district downtown, it does not require off street parking requirements out right.  
Although it is conflicted with this particular special use request, the UDC requires 
a plan for parking approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.  He pointed out the 
Compatibility Standards 2.2.304 for Places of Public Assembly in a “C-3” zoning 
District.  
 
 “C-3” Parking: Accommodated through on-lot, on-street, or private off-street 
parking within 300 feet of the place of public assembly.   
  Parking Demand will not place material demands on the existing parking 
during peak demand hours for retail, restaurant and other commercial uses.  
 
     He provided an illustration to show a circle around where the area of 300 feet 
from 1102 Main Street. There are 335 stalls on the street and 274 off-street 
parking stalls either public or private.  That highlighted in yellow indicates parking 
lots that fluctuate during different hours. 
 
     He stated that Curtis Deines had done a parking analysis downtown on several 
days of the week including a Saturday night on the week of February 24th and 4 
different time periods per day.  The parking analysis performed shows that on 
Main between 10th and 11th between 10:30 a.m. and l:00 p.m. is 75% of the 
spaces are occupied.  The other area that is the highest being occupied is on 
11th Street from Main to Oak after 6:00 p.m. (Gela’s, Paisley Pair, Brass Rail).  
With the average of only 35% of the 416 total parking stalls being taken during the 
day, there is adequate parking to accommodate this use especially late afternoon, 
evening hours and mornings. 
 
 Peak Times 
10:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (Lunch) 
 6:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on East 11th St  
 
     He emphasized to note that they are in no way advocating parking allowances 
on private lots.  Parking allowances on private lots are completely controlled by 
the owner whether they allow public parking is completely up to them during 
regular business hours or not.   
       
      The recommended action is to set a public hearing for April 8, 2020 to 
consider approval of the submitted Special Use Permit for a Place of Public 
Assembly at 1102 Main Street. 
 
     He asked for any questions.  He pointed out that if there are questions 
between now and the public hearing to contact himself or Curtis Deines.   
 
     There were no questions.

B. Set a Public Hearing for a request by Standee H Dalton requesting a 
variance to reduce the front setback from 25 ft to 7 ft for a carport at 2307 
Oak Street. 
 
         Jesse Rohr provided a power point presentation on the overhead visual 
with the information, location, and overview site of the above property for the 
requested reduction in front yard building setback from 25 feet to 7 feet, a 
variance of 18 feet for an open carport at 2307 Oak Street. This property is in 
the NC.3 District.  The property faces Oak Street. This carport had been 
constructed without contacting the city or obtaining a permit. The carport sets 
over the driveway of the property.  He showed pictures of the open carport.  
 
     He showed the table from the UDC that shows the setback requirements for this 
zoning district.   
 
     He stated that two previous cases with a similar request in the past had not been 
approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.  Most variances for carports with the 
sides open have been approved for the side yard.  
 
     He pointed out two considerations: 
 
 The setback standards are not less than 25 feet in many of all existing 
properties in Hays. 
 
 The purpose of the Neighborhood Revitalization Conservation District is 
intended to provide for neighborhood stability and character and allow for 
reasonable expansion or new construction in established residential 
neighborhoods. 
  
     The action requested is to move to set a public hearing for April 8, 2020 to 
consider a variance request at 2307 Oak Street for a setback reduction of 25 feet to 
7 feet for a variance of 18 feet for a carport. 
 
     He asked for any questions.  He pointed out that if there are questions 
between now and the public hearing to contact himself or Curtis Deines.  
 
There were no questions. 
 
       Russell Koenigsman moved, Brian Garrett seconded the motion to set a 
public hearing for the request of an 18 foot variance for the reduction in the front 
yard building setback from the required 25 feet to 7 feet at 2307 Oak Street that is 
within a “NC.3” zoning district.

5. OFF AGENDA ITEMS/COMMUNICATIONS:  
 
A.  Procedure of the BZA Application:  Every application is due a public hearing.  
Discussion if continue a two-meeting process and if staff or the board will set the 
public hearing date. 
     Jerry Sonntag pointed out he did not know why a two-meeting process was 
necessary when all cases submitted will be entitled to a public hearing.  They 
will not have to decide if there should be a public hearing. It is unnecessarily 
taking up people’s time in the day.   
 
     He pointed out that the parameters are a little bit different with the new 
Unified Development Code. It streamlines a lot of things that are taken care of.  
The frustration he has, as a builder, is to inform potential applicants requesting a 
variance about the time it takes to get a variance and that it is a two-meeting 
process. The applicants do not like to go before the board twice. Some do not 
like getting up before people. He asked why they would even vote to set a public 
hearing since it would appear there is an option.  
 
     Jesse Rohr answered that staff can set the public hearing; technically the 
board does not have to set the public hearing.  The public notice establishes the 
public hearing.  He used the example of the City Commission Work Session 
where they receive the information and it is moved on the City Commission 
Meeting. 
 
     Jesse Rohr explained the history of the procedure and how it evolved to the 
two-meeting procedure.  Seven years ago, or so, there was only the public 
hearing meeting.  Staff set the public hearing and the established publication 
notice was printed in the local newspaper 20 days before the public hearing.  
The abutting property owners received a copy of the publication notice. The 
reason for the change to the two-meeting procedure was because there was not 
enough time to gather the facts and ask all the questions at the public hearing 
for a decision.  This led to tabling some cases to the next meeting.   
     
    With discussion, it came about that per state statute, every application is 
afforded a due process of a public hearing. 
 
    Staff works with the potential applicant and informs them of the regulatory 
requirements that are to be met to request a variance or special use permit 
request. Once they apply, they are to be allowed a public hearing.   
 
     Jesse Rohr pointed out to the board that it is up to them if they want to 
receive the information and see the visuals etc. a month before the public 
hearing date that staff would prefer.  Would staff or the board set the public 
hearing.  
           
 
 
5
     Toby Dougherty, City Manager, stated that as part of the due process, he did 
not think it was a bad practice for the Hays Area Board of Zoning Appeals to set 
the public hearing.  That way the applicant knows the board has heard it and 
looked at it. He noted the process of the City Commission where there is a work 
session before the official meeting of setting the public hearing.   He added that 
they do not want a predetermination that the applicant thinks that the board had 
their mind made up before the public hearing. 
 
     He stated that he does agree with Jesse Rohr and the City Attorney that if 
someone does ask for a variance, they do get their public hearing before the 
Hays Area Board of Zoning Appeals.  
 
     Jerry Sonntag asked how there could be a discussion without them having an 
inkling of the potential outcome. 
    
     Toby Dougherty pointed out that the board would have to be cognizant of 
clarifying questions that are not portrayed as being in favor or against 
something.  He stated some examples of information gathering questions to 
make the decision at the public hearing.   
 
     Jerry Sonntag pointed out that his point was how it used to be with the public 
hearing at the following month’s meeting. He would rather not have a vote to set 
the public hearing since some do not have the concept of how this works.   
 
     Toby Dougherty stated that the Staff can let the applicant know there is no 
determination when setting the public hearing.   
 
      Jerry Sonntag stated that he would like to have the applicant attend the first 
meeting also in case there are questions or certain reasons things are the way 
they are due to hardship or other. He would like to have the first meeting as an 
informational meeting and ask questions with no voting.  Staff will then set the 
public hearing.   
 
     Toby Dougherty answered that this is the choice of the BZA members what 
will works best for them if they would like staff to set the public hearing that 
would be fine too.  The reason for the two-step process is it provides information 
to alleviate any tabling due to a request for more information.  
 
     Toby Dougherty asked if it would be more comfortable if the requested action 
was taken away and rather just state the day of the public hearing.  Brian Garrett 
stated that he was in favor of that.   
 
     Jesse Rohr stated that it could be the first meeting for one case and a public 
hearing for another case at the same meeting.  They could establish up front the 
date of the public hearing and provide the information associated with it with 
some questions they would like answered before the public hearing.   
 
     Toby Dougherty stated that he wanted to clarify his words of caution, the City 
Commission is a Legislative Body, The BZA is a quasi-judicial body.  
Legislatures have ability to make all kinds of statements and tell people how 
 
 
6
they are going to vote.  A judge does not talk during a trial how they are going to 
rule on the case.  They ask clarifying questions.  With this board being quasi-
judicial the BZA has the sole authority to grant appeals, with the District Court 
being the only way to appeal the BZA decision. There is no legislative appeal 
past the BZA is the reason his words of caution.  They do not have the right to 
predetermine. 
 
     Lou Caplan asked if everyone was happy with the City Staff setting the public 
hearing and just have an informational meeting for the first meeting.  Brian 
Garrett stated that he would like the informational meeting.  All the board 
members agreed. 
 
     Toby Dougherty stated to the board to feel free to ask questions and ask 
why.  This is a very detailed code.  There have been changes since it was 
adopted because of parts that did not conform or they did not agree with. 
 
     Jesse Rohr concurred to feel free to ask questions.  
 
     Jesse Rohr asked the new members if they had any questions at this time. 
He explained to them that they are welcome to stop by to visit with Curtis Deines 
or himself.

DATE PREPARED:

MEETING DATE:  
June 10, 2020 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
 
The applicant is requesting a variance to reduce the front yard setback of a 
residential property from 25 ft. to 7 ft. for a carport (already installed without permit).  
A public hearing will be conducted on April 8, 2020 to consider the variance request.  
Staff is not in favor of the variance request as submitted. The carport as installed is a 
violation of zoning code and does not appear to meet the requirements for a 
variance. 
 
BACKGROUND:

 The house sits approximately 24.5 ft from the front property line.

 Page 2 
 Below is UDC Table 3.3.201 showing building standards for lots in various 
Districts. Previous zoning prior to UDC change had this area as R-3.  
Indicated in red are the setback requirements. 
 
 The purpose of the Neighborhood Conservation (NC) district, as further 
delineated by subdistricts, is intended to provide for neighborhood stability 
while at the same time allowing for reasonable expansion and in some 
cases, new construction, in established residential neighborhoods. The NC 
district is generally characterized by development of existing residential 
neighborhoods that pre-dated the effective date of this Code. 
 Majority of the City of Hays residential districts have a 25ft front yard setback 
requirement. 
 There have been 2 cases in the past with similar requests that have been 
denied. 
 Reasonable accommodation for any person that has a disability can be taken 
into consideration.  
 
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION: (Per State Statute 12-759 and City Unified Development 
Code) 
 
 The BZA has the authority to grant a variance if a literal enforcement of the 
provisions of the adopted regulations, will, in an individual case, result in 
unnecessary hardship, provided: 
o The spirit of the regulations shall be observed 
o Public safety and welfare secured 
 Page 3 
o Substantial justice shall be done 
 The applicant must show that the property was acquired in good faith and that 
the variance is needed due to extraordinary or exceptional circumstances of 
the property such as exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the 
lot. 
 Before granting a variance on the basis of unusual difficulty or unreasonable 
hardship, there must be finding by the Board that all of the following conditions 
exist: 
 
a. 
Uniqueness of the property not ordinarily found in the same zone or 
district and not created by willful action of the owner 
 
Staff Analysis:  This is a 60 ft x 111 ft lot. This is a common size in this 
neighborhood. No obvious uniqueness to the property exists.  
 
b. The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent 
property owners.  
 
Staff Analysis:  It seems that this request could have an adverse effect on 
the rights of adjacent property owners due to the expectation of consistent 
and uniformly applied zoning regulations to help protect the character of the 
neighborhood. 
 
c. 
The strict application of the code will constitute unnecessary hardship 
upon the property owner. 
 
Staff Analysis: This is likely a self-imposed hardship. Even though this is the 
easiest location for access to the front, there may be adequate room to place 
a carport in the rear yard. Reasonable accommodation for anyone with a 
disability can be taken into consideration. 
 
d. The variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, 
order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare 
 
Staff Analysis:  If granted as proposed, this variance may not adversely 
affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or 
general welfare. 
 
e. 
The granting of the variance desired will not be opposed to the general 
spirit and intent of the regulations.   
 
Staff Analysis: The granting of a variance for the proposed building with a 
reduced front yard setback does oppose the general spirit and intent of the 
zoning regulations.  
 
OPTIONS: 
 Page 4 
 
The BZA has the following options after conducting a public hearing on the requested 
variance: 
 Deny the variance as submitted 
 Approve a variance with conditions, including but not limited to a requirement 
to restore the property to compliance upon the current resident vacating the 
premises (a self-executing bond or other instrument can be required to ensure 
future compliance) 
 Approve the variance requested with no conditions 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
 
Staff is not in favor of the variance request as submitted. The carport as installed is a 
violation of zoning code and does not appear to meet the requirements for a 
variance. Specific conditions for accommodation may be considered.

Lanely"s car port
Date:

Ashley,
I wanted to reach out to you today because i was speaking with my neighbor Lanely, who i
believe you represent, and she mentioned the city of Hays has some concerns regarding the
appearance of her car port.  My home likely has the best view of her car port, because much of
it is surrounded by a few trees.  I wanted to say that I think her car port looks just fine in our
neighborhood.  As I mentioned before, most of the car ports view is obstructed and if it wasn't
I still don't believe it would take away from the aesthetic of our area.  In fact, I admire the
utility of it and I am happy knowing that it could make make things easier for Lanely in any
way.  You see, I first met Lanely when she had fallen just outside her door.  I was outside and
heard the commotion, so I ran over to help and to make sure she was alright until help arrived. 
Anyway, I understand she is suffering a few health problems and if the car port makes life
easier for her then I think it is a good thing to have.  
Admittedly, I was a little slow getting this email out and I hope I wasn't too late getting it to
you.  If there's any way I might be able to help don't be afraid to reach out.  Thank you

Special Use Permit for Place of Public Assembly  
PRESENTED BY:

DATE PREPARED:

AGENDA DATE: 
 
June 10, 2020 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
The applicant is requesting a special use permit to allow a “Place of Public 
Assembly” located in a C-3 zoned district at 1102 Main St. The owners recently 
purchased this building with intentions of remodeling the interior and opening a place 
of public assembly for activities. The Unified Development Code requires this type of 
use to have a plan for parking to be approved by the Board of Zoning. The 
compatibility standards require the owner to accommodate parking through on-lot, 
on-street, or private off-street parking within 300 feet of the property.  
   
After taking into consideration all known factors, staff feels that the request is 
reasonable and will not have a detrimental effect on the surrounding properties.   
 
BACKGROUND: 
The owners recently purchased this building with intentions of remodeling the interior 
and opening a place of public assembly for activities that could include: public event 
venue, conferences, banquets, private parties, and weddings.  The City of Hays 
Unified Development Code requires this type of use to have a plan for parking to be 
approved by the Board of Zoning. The compatibility standards require the owner to 
accommodate parking through on-lot, on-street, or private off-street parking within 
300 feet of the property and not place material demands upon the on-street or public 
parking during peak demand for retail, restaurant, and other commercial uses.  
 
Staff calculated parking based on the expected occupant load of 300 people. 86 
parking stalls would need to be accounted for within this area.  Staff has also 
conducted a parking study of the area within one block east and west of Main St. 
(from Oak and Fort from 13th to 10th St.) The study identified that the peak time for 
parking is between 10:30am to 1:00 pm every day of public and private parking 
City of Hays 
Planning Inspection Enforcement 
 Page 2 
areas.  The low peak is in the evenings after 5:30 pm.  11th Street is the busiest street 
overall after 10:00 am. Many businesses are open and Gella’s is an anchor business 
that has a large draw to downtown.  The proposed venue would have adequate 
parking during evening/nighttime events.  
 
If this venue would have daytime events, there is also adequate parking in the area, 
however attendees may have to walk further due to 11th St being the busiest street 
during the day. 
 
Downtown Hays is zoned C-3 and does not require off street parking requirements 
out right.  It is important to note that other uses, such as a large office complex, large 
restaurant, or even a bingo hall, are allowed uses in the C-3 district and DO NOT 
require a special use permit or any consideration of parking being given, even though 
they may have occupancies as high as a place of public assembly. 
 
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION: 
Per State Statute 12-759 (e) and City Ordinance UDC Sec. 11.2.408 
 
In taking into consideration applications for a special use permit, the BZA shall give 
consideration to the comprehensive zoning plan, the health, safety, morals, comfort 
and general welfare of the inhabitants of the community, including, but not limited to, 
the following factors (particularly the bolded factors): 
 The stability and integrity of the various zoning districts 
 Conservation of property values 
 Protection against fire and casualties 
 Observation of general police regulations 
 Prevention of traffic congestion 
 Promotion of traffic safety and the orderly parking of motor vehicles 
 Promotion of the safety of individuals and property 
 Provision for adequate light and air 
 Prevention of overcrowding and excessive intensity of land uses 
 Provision for public utilities 
 Invasion by inappropriate uses 
 Value, type and character of existing or authorized improvements and land use 
 Encouragement of improvements and land uses in keeping with overall 
planning 
 Provision for orderly and proper urban renewal, development and growth 
 
By ordinance, the BZA does have the authority to impose certain restrictions, 
conditions, terms, time limitations, landscaping, and other appropriate safeguards to 
protect adjoining property.   
 
STAFF ANALYSIS: 
 Page 3 
After considering all factors and evaluating the surrounding area, staff feels that the 
request is reasonable and will not have a detrimental effect on the surrounding 
properties.  A parking count was performed on February 24, 26, & 28 at 4 different 
time periods of the day to identify peak times and how much parking is available in 
the East and West 100 block of 10th, 11th, 12th St. and Main Street from 13th to 10th 
St. This analysis determines that there is parking available to support this type of 
business. 
 
OPTIONS: 
The following are options to consider: 
 Approve the special use permit request for a Place of Public Assembly. 
 Do not approve the special use permit request.  
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
Approve the Special Use Permit request for a Place of Public Assembly at 1102 Main 
St.

Floodplain Regulation Variance Request 
ADDRESS:  
803 Fort St.  
OWNER: 
Adam Pray 
TYPE OF REVIEW: 
Floodplain Regulation Variance Request 
PRESENTED BY:  
Curtis W. Deines, P. I. E. Superintendent 
DATE PREPARED: 
May 7, 2020 
MEETING DATE:  
June 10, 2020 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
The property owner is requesting a variance from floodplain regulations that will allow 
substantial improvements to the property for a new business. A property owner is 
limited to only spending 50% of the appraised value of the structure for substantial 
improvements or making the structure compliant with floodplain regulations. This 
property is within the Chestnut Street Historic District that is registered with the 
national registry. Within the FEMA’s regulations, nationally registered buildings do not 
have to meet the same requirements especially if any work may affect the historic 
designation. Staff recommends approval of the variance requested. 
BACKGROUND: The property owner is requesting a variance from floodplain 
regulations that will allow substantial improvements to the property for a new 
business. This property has previously been used as a bike repair shop and most 
recently a private pitching/batting cage.  No major improvements have been made to 
the property in the last 10 years. Part of the challenge is being located within the 100 
year flood zone. A property owner is limited to only spending 50% of the appraised 
value of the structure for substantial improvements or is required to make the 
structure compliant with floodplain regulations. This property is within the Chestnut 
Street Historic District and is listed on the National Historic Registry. Within the 
FEMA’s regulations, nationally registered historic buildings do not have to meet the 
same requirements especially if any work may affect the historic designation. 
Therefore, the property owner is requesting the variance to follow the process and 
documentation requirements. 
City of Hays 
Planning Inspection Enforcement
Page 2 
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION: (Per City Unified Development Code) 
Approval Criteria.  In passing upon such application for variances, the Board of 
Zoning Appeals shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, 
standards specified in Article 9.3, Flood Damage Prevention, and the following 
criteria (11.2.411): 
1. Danger to life and property due to flood damage.
Staff Analysis: This property was built in 1930 prior to any flood 
regulations.  This property is located on the outer edge of the floodplain 
and in most cases the water would typically rise and fall rather than 
flow around this property.  This would reduce the risk and danger to life 
and property damage.  
2. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to injury of others.
Staff Analysis:  The building is a block building and the interior items 
would more than likely not be swept out causing issue with other 
areas. 
3. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents of flood damage and the
effects of such damage on the individual owner.
Staff Analysis: 803 Fort is located on the edge of the floodplain 
reducing the probability this property being affected by a flood. 
4. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
Staff Analysis: The proposed business has been established in Hays 
for several years and this location would be beneficial to the 
redevelopment of this area.  
5. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable
Staff Analysis: This situation is N/A. 
6. Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the
propose use.
Staff Analysis:  The developer/owner had considered other locations 
for the proposed business and did not find a suitable location that met 
their needs. 
7.
Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
Staff Analysis: The use proposed is compatible with the area and will 
enhance the market of the downtown area. 
8. Relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain
management program for that area.
Page 3 
Staff Analysis: This use does conform to the Comprehensive Plan 
and the proposal will have little if any effect on the floodplain 
management program. 
9. Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary emergency
vehicles.
Staff Analysis: Access to this property is very accessible to the public 
and emergency vehicles.  There are no known floods in the area in the 
last 60 years. 
10. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the
flood waters, if applicable, expect at the site
Staff Analysis: An elevation survey was completed. Current BFE is .9 
ft higher than existing floor level.  Using the proposed maps for base 
flood elevation (BFE), the proposed BFE is 2.9 ft higher than the 
existing floor level putting it above the windowsills of the front windows. 
11. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions,
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets, and bridges.
Staff Analysis: This location does not have any public infrastructure 
located on it. All services are private, and any costs incurred would be 
on the property owner. 
OPTIONS: 
The BZA has the following options after conducting a public hearing on the requested 
variance: 

Approve the variance as requested

Approve a variance with conditions

Deny the variance as submitted
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
Staff is in favor of the variance request as submitted and recommends approval. The 
structure is listed on the National Historic Registry and any modifications to the 
building may jeopardize the designation and redevelopment of the property.

Re: 
Preliminary Comment, FEMA Floodplain Regulations, 803 Fort, Hays – Ellis County 
We have reviewed the request for alterations to 803 Fort, a contributing resource to the Chestnut Street 
Historic District. The proposed base flood elevation (BFE) would extend above the sill of the existing 
windows on the front of the building. Any flood adaptation would alter the appearance of the windows and 
storefront system, both of which are character-defining features of the historic property. The SHPO reviews 
projects using the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. Standard #2 states that “The 
historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or 
alteration of features, spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.” Altering 
or otherwise obscuring the façade would adversely affect the features and spatial relationships of the 
historic property and would therefore impact its historic designation as a contributor to a National Register-
listed historic district.  
Please submit any comments or questions regarding this comment to Lauren Jones at 785-272-8681, ext.

TYPE OF REVIEW: 
Special Use Permit for a Cemetery in A-L Agriculture 
PRESENTED BY:

AGENDA DATE: 
 
June 10, 2020 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
In 2017, the Diocese of Salina and St. Joseph’s Church in Hays obtained 28.90 
acres of land located 2.5 miles southwest of Hays located within the City of Hays 
Exterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ). The current zoning is A-L Agriculture and the applicant 
wishes to use this location as a cemetery.  UDC Table 2.2.203 requires a special use 
permit to be approved for this use.   
After taking into consideration all known factors, staff feels that the request is 
reasonable and will not have a detrimental effect on the surrounding properties.   
BACKGROUND: 
In 2017, the Diocese of Salina and St. Joseph’s Church in Hays obtained 28.90 
acres of land located 2.5 miles southwest of Hays located within the City of Hays 
Exterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ). The current zoning is A-L Agriculture and the applicant 
wishes to use this location as a cemetery.  The current cemetery location at 27th and 
Main in Hays has a very limited number of plots left, and this location will meet their 
needs for the future.  UDC Table 2.2.203 requires a special use permit to be 
approved for this use.  There is one specific design requirement that would apply. 
The site shall be located on and have access to a collector or arterial street.  230th 
Ave meets that criteria for access.   
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION: 
Per State Statute 12-759 (e) and City Ordinance UDC Sec. 11.2.408 
In taking into consideration applications for a special use permit, the BZA shall give 
consideration to the comprehensive zoning plan, the health, safety, morals, comfort

MEETING DATE:  
June 10, 2020 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
 
The applicant is requesting a variance to reduce the platted front yard setback of a 
commercial property from 35 ft. to 32 ft. to allow for a new front façade to extend from 
the current building.  Previous regulation required the front setback to be 35 ft from 
the front property line which is shown on the original plat. Staff is in favor of this 
variance request. 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
 The applicant is requesting a platted front setback variance of the front yard: 
o Front Yard – 35’ to 32’

 Below is UDC Table 3.1.301B showing building standards for lots in various 
Districts.  
 
 
 When the property was platted, 35 ft. was the required setback, due to the 
arterial designation of 27th St.  In the 2016 UDC zoning code update, the 
commercial setbacks changed to make all the districts the same setback 
regardless of the type of street it fronted or accessed. 
 If the property was platted today, a 25 ft front setback would be allowed. 
 
STANDARDS OF EVALUATION: (Per State Statute 12-759 and City Unified Development 
Code) 
 
 The BZA has the authority to grant a variance if a literal enforcement of the 
provisions of the adopted regulations, will, in an individual case, result in 
unnecessary hardship, provided: 
o The spirit of the regulations shall be observed 
o Public safety and welfare secured 
o Substantial justice shall be done 
 The applicant must show that the property was acquired in good faith and that 
the variance is needed due to extraordinary or exceptional circumstances of 
the property such as exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the 
lot. 
 Page 3 
 Before granting a variance on the basis of unusual difficulty or unreasonable 
hardship, there must be finding by the Board that all of the following conditions 
exist: 
 
a. 
Uniqueness of the property not ordinarily found in the same zone or 
district and not created by willful action of the owner 
 
Staff Analysis:  This lot is not specifically unique to other lots in the area.  
The uniqueness is that the original plat required a different setback from what 
is required today.  
 
b. The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent 
property owners.  
 
Staff Analysis:  This request should not have an adverse effect of the 
adjacent properties. A 3 ft variance will not change the character of the 
neighborhood. 
 
c. 
The strict application of the code will constitute unnecessary hardship 
upon the property owner. 
 
Staff Analysis: The building was built on the previous setback requirements 
and the new design extends into the current setback that would require a 
different design that will not provide the same concept for marketing and 
aesthetics they wish to achieve. 
 
d. The variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, 
order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare 
 
Staff Analysis:  If granted as proposed, this variance will not adversely affect 
the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general 
welfare. 
 
e. 
The granting of the variance desired will not be opposed to the general 
spirit and intent of the regulations.   
 
Staff Analysis: The granting of a variance for the proposed building with a 
reduced front yard platted setback does not oppose the general spirit and 
intent of the zoning regulations. 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
 
None at this time – Public Hearing for  consideration of approval will occur on July 8.

MEETING DATE:  
June 10, 2020 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
 
The applicant is requesting a variance to reduce the east side yard setback from the 
required 5ft to 3 ft, a variance of 2 ft, and reduce the separation distance between 
structures from 5 ft to 3 ft, a variance of 2 ft. The applicant currently has an existing 
non-conforming structure and would like to construct a slightly narrower detached 
garage/structure in a similar location. Staff is in favor of this variance request. 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
 The applicant is requesting a side yard and building separation variance: 
o Side Yard – 5’ to 3 
o Building Separation - 5’ to 3’

Uniqueness of the property not ordinarily found in the same zone or 
district and not created by willful action of the owner 
 
Staff Analysis:  This lot is not specifically unique to other lots in the area.  
The lot does have an existing non-conforming structure on the property. 
 
b. The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent 
property owners.  
 
Staff Analysis:  This request should not have an adverse effect of the 
adjacent properties. A larger structure has been there for many years and any 
new structure will be more aesthetically pleasing.  The new proposed 
structure is 2 ft narrower than the existing non-conforming structure. 
 
c. 
The strict application of the code will constitute unnecessary hardship 
upon the property owner. 
 
Staff Analysis: The current structure is non-conforming, and any new 
structure would not increase in non-conformity.  Other locations in the back 
yard may be available but more difficult due to utility locations. 
 
d. The variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, 
order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare 
 
Staff Analysis:  If granted as proposed, this variance should not adversely 
affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or 
general welfare.

the zoning regulations.

To: Hays Area Board of Zoning Appeals 
 
From: Jesse Rohr 
 
 
 
Board of Zoning Members, 
 
 
 
I am respectfully submitting a request for a building setback variance for the 
Board’s consideration for the property located at 209 E 19th St.  With approval, I am 
considering constructing a 12’ x 24’ garage/shed to replace an existing 14’ x 20’ carport.  
The carport is several decades old and no longer serves a useful purpose.  I have 
explained further justification for consideration below: 
 
1. Uniqueness:  The existing 14’ x 20’ carport has been on the property for several 
decades.  As only the second owner of this home constructed in 1948, it can only 
be assumed the original owner built the carport for an RV due to the extensive 
height of the structure, therefore making it not very conducive for normal 
vehicles.  The roof is dilapidated and does not shed water in any desired manner.  
The carport is approx. 3’ from the side property line and 3’ from another 10’ x 12’ 
garden shed.  The proposed garage would be narrower in width by 2’ and longer 
by 4’ (12’ x 24’).  
  
2. Adjacent Property:  The proposed garage will not be any closer to the adjacent 
property to the east than the existing carport.  The lot immediately to the east 
does have a detached garage several feet from the property line, as can be seen 
in the attached visual.  No other adjacent properties are impacted by this 
variance request. 
 
3. Hardship:  While other areas on the property were considered for construction of 
a small detached garage, the proposed location is the most suitable for several 
reasons.  This proposed area has no underground or overhead utilities that 
would interfere with placement of a structure.  All utilities (gas, electric, sewer, 
telecommunications) for the property are located on the western half of the 
property.  Also, the existing carport has a concrete drive entrance from the 
concrete alley and an existing slab that may be utilized for the proposed garage.  
Any other location would require a new drive approach and concrete slab/floor. 
 
Also, due to the limited buildable width of 18’, with no approved variance the 
garage width would be limited to 8’ (5’ setback from sideyard and 5’ from other 
structures).  12’ is the minimal size garage that is still considered useable for 
most modern vehicles.  The proposed 12’ garage would be 2’ narrower than the 
exiting carport. 
 
4. Public Interest:  It does not appear that removal of the existing carport and 
granting of a variance for the construction of the proposed garage will have any 
adverse effect on the health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or 
general welfare of the community or neighboring properties.  It is hoped that the 
garage will only enhance the aesthetics of the property and value of the property. 
 
5. Spirit and Intent of the Zoning Regulations:  The granting of the variance 
desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of the current zoning 
regulations.  The new proposed garage will not contribute to any significant 
negative impacts for the subject property or adjacent properties.  The garage will 
be appealing, safe, and useable to its full extent if approval of a variance as 
requested is granted. 
 
Your consideration of the variance request is much appreciated.  Contact me with any 
questions you may have. 
 
Jesse Rohr
