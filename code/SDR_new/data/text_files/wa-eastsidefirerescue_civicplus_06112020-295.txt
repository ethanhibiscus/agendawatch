FIRE CHIEF BRIEFING: 
51 
•
PFAS: Received notification the construction and field work can continue. The project is
52 
currently on track with the budget.
53 
• Personnel Update: The Finance and Administrative Director, Lisa King, has resigned.
54 
There has been an internal promotion, however, most of the salary will be savings for 
55 
the year.    
56 
• COVID-19 Update: Reviewed the recent document that outlines the Guidelines for a
57 
Phased Approach to EF&R Operations. Spoke to the impacts of closing community 
58 
meeting spaces, station tours, events, crew inspections, and returning to a new normal. 
59 
Phased Guidelines attached. 
60 
61 
REGULAR BUSINESS: 
62 
• City of Issaquah Financial Consideration Request: Discussed the financial consideration
63 
request from the City of Issaquah. Chief Clark spoke at length with City staff and the 
64 
strategy moving forward. Briefed the Board of EF&R’s potential financial risks and budget 
65 
concessions moving forward.  
66 
67 
• Financial risks/threats: 
68 
 Current expenses related to COVID-19 is $400k, with a $10k weekly increase.
69 
There is a threat of a second wave of COVID-19 and mitigating those financial 
70 
impacts.  
71 
 Wildland Season: Any event would be a potential minimum impact of $1 million.
72 
 PFAS: The DOE may see potential funding impacts to Capital Projects, that could
73 
result in unbudgeted expenses. EF&R has spent $250k for the consultant and 
74 
waiting for reimbursement from the State. Discussed the possibility of suspending 
75 
the work.  
76 
 Transport Revenue: Transports are down 20%, which directly impacts revenue,
77 
due to less people being on the road and less patients not going to the hospital. 
78 
• Expenditure Control: 
79 
 Hiring Freeze and vacant positions frozen
80 
 Budget freeze for all non-essential spending
81 
 Negotiated an MOU with the Union related to a 12-hour training day and reducing
82 
overtime, which will see a $100k savings. 
83 
84 
Discussion continued with the timeline of the budget kick-off taking place next month 
85 
through October. It is imperative to set the table properly for the next two-year budget 
86 
cycle.  
87 
88 
The Chief mentioned the EF&R Board Policy 0002 has language that allows for a Budget 
89 
Stabilization Reserve Fund, which would be applicable for situations like this when 
90 
partner relief is a potential need. It is currently not funded; however, the Board can fund 
91 
it as they see fit.  
92 
93 
Chief briefed that there is a mutual understanding of budget expenditure controls and 
94 
revenue options with Issaquah city staff. The outcome of the conversation is a 
95 
recommendation for the Board to review the Transport Fees and Ambulance Revenue 
96 
as well as Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVA) and the recent legislation to support it. Chief 
97 
Clark proposed the Board recommend to the FAC to review those items. It was discussed 
98 
to also look to additional options to generate revenue opposed to looking at budget cuts, 
99 
including Burn Permit fees, Hazard Storage fees, etc. 
100

2. Budget Discussion: Chief Clark discussed potential fees to increase revenue.
34 
•
Transport Fee: Reviewed the current BLS transport fees, projected 2020 revenue
35 
and potential increased revenue. Discussed the process of transport billing,
36 
mileage fees, and the current process of billing for transports. Clarified that citizens
37 
are “balanced billed”, but EF&R does not seek collections. This will not change
38 
what is collected from Medicare or Medicaid, it will only be billed to private
39 
insurance companies.
40 
41 
Discussed the impacts of billing citizens, the median costs of transports (related to
42 
the AMR contract rate), Systems Design (vendor) fees and role in collections, the
43 
data to estimate the average cost of an EF&R transport, and potential policy
44 
language related to Section 5.4. Discussed FEMA reimbursement as it relates to
45 
personnel, equipment, and apparatus costs.
46 
Page 8 of 24
47 
The Committee discussed a phased approach with implementation and potential 
48 
data surrounding age range of calls.  Clarified that changing transport rates does 
49 
not impact fees to citizens, only insurance companies.  
50 
o
FAC questions: Is the Committee interested in adjusting the fees? What is
51 
the rate based on? Do we want to bill citizens via invoicing from the vendor?
52 
Do we want to do any collection work? When, if any, would be the right time
53 
to change rates?
54 
o
Mixed feedback to raising the fee, due to the current environment and
55 
benchmarking what the rate is based on.
56 
o
Not opposed to speaking to the vendor related to their process for
57 
invoices/notices.
58 
59 
Additional information will be brought to the June meeting for further discussion. 
60 
61 
• Review Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) Fees: Recapped the initial pilot program. The
62 
State legislation goes into effect June 11, 2020, which will change the process. Chief 
63 
will bring additional information to the June meeting for a decision from the FAC 
64 
whether to move forward. 
65 
66 
• Discuss current and potential fees: Current fees include shop fees, transport fees,
67 
CPR classes, and inspection fees. Additional information will be brought to the June 
68 
meeting for further discussion. 
69 
70 
Potential Treat & Refer fee: On July 23, 2017, Legislature passed House Bill 1358. 
71 
The law allows Fire Departments to establish and collect reasonable charges for 
72 
services provided under the community assistance referral and educational services 
73 
program (RCW 35.21.930). Treat & Refer provides 9-1-1 callers with the option of 
74 
receiving treatment at home, followed by referral to destinations that can provide 
75 
immediate access to care in non-emergent situations. Destination and referral options 
76 
include behavioral health providers, urgent care, primary care/specialists, crisis 
77 
response or the option of staying home. Additional information will be brought to the 
78 
June meeting for further discussion.

Overview 
The 2021-2022 Draft Budget overview is presented below and represents a 1.65% 
increase to partner contributions in 2021, and a 1.69% increase in 2022. While this 
summary is representative of the 2021-2022 anticipated budget, it will undoubtedly 
change between now and October of 2020 when we anticipate asking for final approval 
of the 2021-2022 Budget. While we do not anticipate significant changes, we do anticipate 
updates to projections and potential amendments after discussion with the Finance and 
Administrative Committee (FAC). All changes and a summary of the discussion with the 
FAC will be presented at the October Board of Directors meeting.  
COVID-19 has contributed to an uncertain economic future prompting EF&R staff’s 
attempt to keep this budget as flat as possible while maintaining commitment to the 
Agency’s strategic priorities. As you are aware, we are entering into negotiations with 
three labor groups, which the outcome will impact these numbers. 
Key discussions for the FAC will involve: 
•
Sustaining current service levels (Strategic Priority: Life Safety – Provide for life
safety, and the protection of property and the environment)
•
Impacts of a flat budget request (Strategic Priority: Long Term Sustainability,
Objective 3)
•
Impacts of collective bargaining strategies (Strategic Priority: Long Term
Sustainability, Objective 6)
•
Equipment replacement fund policy revisions (Strategic Priority: Long Term
Sustainability, Objective 1)
•
End Fund Balance strategies (Strategic Priority: Long Term Sustainability, Objective 1
and 3)
•
Non-Partner Revenue strategies (Strategic Priority: Long Term Sustainability,
Objective 3)
Normally, Administration would present major initiatives for the upcoming budget as well. 
Given the flat budget and current economic conditions, EF&R’s major initiative for this 
budget is to survive the downturn and lead the Agency through the community’s financial 
recovery. 
Initiatives that have not been included in this draft budget and should be discussed 
include: 
Draft Revenue and Expense Summary 
2021-2022  
Page 11 of 24
• Headquarters lease  
• Training grounds  
 
 
• Accreditation – delayed (2023?) 
• Firewise Program – slowed 
• Fire Cadet Program – delayed (resume in 2021) 
• Reserve Program – delays in recruiting and training 
• Wildland Fire Preparedness Fund 
• Chaplain Program  
• Facilities Maintenance 
Opportunities that will need to be pursued within the biennium include: 
• Snoqualmie Tribe contract initial term ends December 31, 2022. Automatically 
renews annually without notice to renegotiate. 
• Collective Bargaining Agreements must be negotiated before the 2023-2024 
budget process kicks off in June of 2022 (if four-year agreements are not reached 
this year). 
• Mobile Integrated Healthcare Initiative, including evaluation of a comprehensive 
treat and refer program. 
• Strategic planning process that was interrupted by COVID-19 will be rescheduled 
for 2021. 
• Temporary Station 71 needs to be completed (unless completed by end of 2020) 
• Remodel of Sammamish Stations 82 and 83. 
• Hazardous Materials/Wildland response agreement with Zone 3 Departments. 
• Community Wildfire Protection Plan Grant was submitted ($75,000), if approved 
would be executed in 2021. 
• Look for additional grant opportunities. 
Please review the tables below for an overview of the proposed 2021-2022 Revenue and 
Expense Budget (Table 1A), Non-Partner Revenue Forecast (Table 1B) and Projected 
Partner Contributions (Tables 2A and 2B).  
Finally, I would like to recommend the EF&R Board refer the 2021-2022 Revenue and 
Expense Budget to the FAC and that the FAC complete it’s work in time to make a final 
recommendation on a 2021-2022 Revenue and Expense Budget for the EF&R Board’s 
consideration at its October 8, 2020 regular meeting.

Eastside Fire & Rescue
Revenue and Expense Report
April 2020
Revenue
Total Operating Revenues are $191,970.91 less than we budgeted.  This is partly due to the timing of 
receiving King County BLS payments.  Also, we expected to receive $500,000 GEMT payment in 2020.  
However, it was received earlier in 2019.
We are starting to see the payments from the GEMT in our transport revenue.  However, we have seen 
our transports decrease over the last couple monthly, likely due to COVID-19.  We expect our 
transports to increase over the rest of the year.  We will continue to watch this revenue stream.    
Expenses
Actual operating expenses are greater than budgeted by $245,831.37.  
Total salaries expenses are greater than budgeted by $110,572.72, which is mainly due to staffing up 
for expected retirement.  We should see these variances reduced in the second half of the year.       
Total benefits are $161,055.00 greater than budgeted.  We are seeing this with Healthcare Benefits and 
payroll taxes.  As with salaries, this is mostly due to staffing up for retirements.    
Total supplies expenses are $103,499.59 greater than budgeted.  This is mostly due protective clothing 
purchases for new hires and EMS supplies purchased due to COVID-19.  We will continue to monitor 
this. 
Total service expenses are $192,295.94less than budgeted. We are seeing this variance mostly in 
Professional Services and Education.
