Resolution No. R2020-15; Adoption Of The Comprehensive Housing Analysis 
For The Greater Gallup Area
The Gallup City Council at their August 27, 2019 regular City Council Meeting 
accepted Legislative Appropriation Number ZD9023 in the amount of $100,000.00 
in order to conduct a comprehensive housing analysis for the greater Gallup area. 
The intent of the study is to determine housing needs for the Gallup area, 
excluding LMI or subsidized housing units. The goal is to develop a plan that 
invites housing development in order to spur economic growth.  
Requests for Proposals (RFP’s) went out and five (5) firms responded. The RFP 
Evaluation Committee evaluated each proposal and met on November 25, 2019 to 
score proposals using criteria developed and included in RFP 2019/2020/01/P. 
After thorough review and discussion the Evaluation Committee selected Sites 
Southwest as the firm most qualified for the project. Sites Southwest was 
awarded the project at the regular City Council meeting on December 10, 2019. 
Sites Southwest has completed the project and a final draft document is being 
presented to City Council for review and adoption. Sites Southwest will give a 
presentation on the process and findings of the analysis.

Resolution No. R2020-16; FY 2021 Initial Budget Adoption
Each year, the City of Gallup prepares an annual budget for the upcoming fiscal 
year. The Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) requires Council to 
pass a resolution to adopt the 2021 Preliminary Budget.  The approved budget 
along with documentation of approval is due to DFA by July 31, 2020.
This budget has been completely reworked from the initial budget approved in 
May.  Due to the pandemic and the impact it has had we are projecting 30% 
reductions to Gross Receipts taxes. Gasoline tax, and some smaller revenue 
items.  As a result we have made some very difficult decisions in how to trim the 
budget to an a spending level that can be met with projected cash and revenue.  
We will be using cash reserves as much as possible to help minimize the impact 
on staff and services provided.

Ordinance No. S2020-6; Repeal Of The Ban On Alcohol Sales At 
Convenience Stores
     On April 14, the Council adopted an Ordinance forbidding the sale of alcohol 
by convenience stores due the concern that individuals were buying alcohol at 
convenience stores and then consuming the alcohol with other individuals, 
thereby significantly increasing the risk of spreading the COVID19 virus. At the 
time, package stores were closed pursuant to a Public Health Order issued by 
the New Mexico Health Secretary. Both the Public Health Order and the Gallup 
ordinance allowed the sale of alcohol by grocery stores. 
     The convenience stores located within Gallup cooperated with the City’s ban 
and have remained compliant with the ordinance. However, as the Health 
Secretary has issued a new Public Health Order allowing package liquor stores to 
open effective June 1, the underlying purpose of the City’s ordinance to limit the 
number of places where alcohol can be purchased to the four grocery stores 
located within the City limits can no longer be met. Therefore, there no longer 
exists a reasonable basis to single out convenience stores as the only category 
of licensed dispensers not allowed to sell alcohol. 
This budget will define anticipated revenue as well as 
spending parameters for the coming fiscal year for each fund.

Request To Award Bid For Marce Court Sewer Improvements (Formal Bid 
No. 2016) And Associated Budget Adjustments
Upon investigation and inspection during calendar year 2019, Staff found that 
approximately 500 feet of 8-inch sewer line in the Marce Ct area was failing and 
creating a potential public health hazard.  Over the past several months, 
wastewater collections crews have monitored the area and prevented any major 
sewer overflows.  During this time, the Water and Sanitation Dept had DePauli 
Engineering Services develop a design and set of bid documents to replace this 
section of sewer line.
During a May 26, 2020 bid opening, Dallago Corporation, of Gallup, NM, 
submitted the apparent low bid of $199,295 (Attachment 1), which has been 
certified by the Engineer of Record, along with a recommendation of award 
(Attachment 2).
As this project was not on a previous year's ICIP Schedule, Staff looked for ways 
to fund the project with existing funds, as shown in the table below:

Budget Adjustment For Change Order No. 1 - Coal And 9th Street Waterline
While working on the water line replacement project at 9th and Coal, the 
Contractor and Field Engineer exposed an old water meter and sewer service line 
to a lot in the area.  
Per City Code 8-1-4, "Changes in Connection - B. Changeover:    In the event of 
a "changeover" connection, where a connection is changed from an old or 
existing water main to a new or other water main, then the city shall bear 
the whole cost thereof. (Ord. C61-25, 4-21-1964);" and City Code 8-4-2 
E.6."Connections may be made to any line without reimbursement cost for 
the purpose of extending the city owned water or sewer system..." 
As the existing water meter and sewer service line in the area had to be relocated 
for the water line replacement project, the City authorized the replacement of the 
water and sewer service lines to the lot in order to complete the water line project, 
via Change Order No. 1.

for the water line replacement project, the City authorized the replacement of the 
water and sewer service lines to the lot in order to complete the water line project, 
via Change Order No. 1.  
Change Order No. 1 (Attachment 1) is in the amount of $9,470.85.  This 
represents an increase of 8.9% to the original contract value of $105,496.38, for a 
revised total contract value of $114,967.23.
Recommendation:
As the replacement of the service lines was caused by project activity, Staff 
recommends approval of a budget adjustment of $9,470 from Fund 506 for the 
Coal and 9th Ave Water Line Replacement Project.

Budget Adjustment Request - Wastewater FY20 Closeout
Operation of the City's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is carried out via an 
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Contract with Jacobs.  
In previous years, Jacobs paid for City Utilities (i.e. electric and water), and was 
reimbursed under their contract with the City.  In FY20, costs for city utility 
service was shifted directly to the City, specifically to be paid by Fund 508.
This was the first year of this modified billing structure, with no previous baseline 
for costs.  As a result, the Water and Sanitation Department had met its 
commitment to directly paying utility costs for the WWTP, but is $74,807.68 
short of its WWTP O&M budget to pay the final O&M invoice from Jacobs and 
close out all WWTP costs for this fiscal year.
Staff requests a budget adjustment of $75,000 from Fund 508 to cover these 
costs.
Budget Adjustment For Walmart Community Grant Award
The Gallup Police Department was selected and awarded a grant in the 
amount of $2,500 from the Walmart Community Grants Team and

The Department will be utilizing the funding for "Microsoft Office" for police vehicle 
mounted mobile laptops.
