Report on results of the Solar Feasibility Study
Sustainability Manager Katy Evans and Consultants Adam Shor and Dan Poydenis 
provided a Solar Feasibility Study to the City Council. The following summary was 
provided:
It is - feasible for the City to build solar on several of the City-owned buildings, predominantly 
those with a larger rooftop area, and evaluate the inclusion of solar from the potential 
solar landfill project during its ongoing discussions with retail electricity providers for the 
City’s next long-term electricity contract.
- have secured an Oncor subsidy for the rooftop projects in the amount of $313,000 that 
will reduce the cost to the City, should it elect to move forward.
We - recommend the City pursue a self-ownership model of the rooftop projects and 
pursue a third-party ownership model of the landfill project.  Next steps would be to 
complete the development of the projects so that the estimates herein can be refined to 
reflect actual costs and numbers which can then be relied upon for installation of the 
projects. 
The proposed City rooftops were identified: City Hall, Margaret Young Natatorium, 
Manske Library, Community Recreation Center, and Landfill Solar Project. 
The City Council discussed cost recovery, grants, green approach, Oncor deadline, and 
construction timeline.
Mayor Pro Tem Norwood asked Ms. Evans if she supported all four locations.  Ms. 
Evans replied stating she recommends starting with the Manske Library and Recreation 
Center.

Agenda Number: G.3
Consider approving Resolution No. 2020-60 for a professional services 
agreement with DFW MultiMedia, Inc. for video production services; and take 
appropriate action
BACKGROUND: 
The City sent out five Requests for Quotations on March 10, and received three responses by the 
March 23 deadline. Of the three, DFW Multimedia offers all professional media and video services 
that the City requires at the lowest bid.
DISCUSSION:
DFW MultiMedia has provided the City with video and technical support for a variety of projects, 
including regularly scheduled City Council and Planning and Zoning meetings, as well as recording 
select special events and targeted promotional videos. City staff has done business with DFW Video 
for a number of years, and feel they are the best fit in meeting and exceeding the contract 
requirements.
Cost Comparison of Previous Agreement to Proposed Agreement
Council/P&Z Meeting Production Costs
Old Contract (based on 48 meetings per year w/ 4 hour minimum to include prep time and shutdown): 
$13,440 
New agreement (based on 48 meetings per year w/ 4 hour minimum to include prep time and 
shutdown): $20,640
-
It should be noted that DFW Video has not raised rates in the first six years of association 
with the City, despite the rising costs of labor for specialized video technicians.
-
Of the other two respondents to the RFP, one did not quote meeting production, one quoted 
meeting production at $119,760 per year (based on 48 meetings).

This ordinance will prevent the on-street parking of trucks rated Class Four or higher, with a gross 
vehicle weight exceeding 14,000 pounds, in and around the apartment complexes in the peninsula 
area. It will make parking more available to apartment residents and visitors as was originally intended.
This area is located within PD-81 and is considered mixed residential. The consensus is that the area 
allows for commercial uses as well as residential. Therefore, the current residential parking prohibitions 
covered in the comprehensive zoning ordinance do not apply.
The police department consulted with the Director of Planning, Director of Community Services and 
the City Attorney in order to develop the parameters for the proposed ordinance. 
RECOMMENDATION:
City Administration recommends adopting Ordinance No. 3637 amending the City of Farmers Branch 
Code of Ordinances, Chapter 82, Traffic and Vehicles, Article II, Division 6, Section 82-95, 
establishing no parking zones for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight exceeding 14,000 pounds on 
Mira Lago Boulevard, Lago Vista West, Lago Vista East, and Hotel Road.

Consider adopting Ordinance No. 3639 amending the City of Farmers Branch 
Code of Ordinances, Chapter 82, Traffic and Vehicles, Article II, Division 6, 
Section 82-95, amending No Parking Zones on Commerce Street; and take 
appropriate action
BACKGROUND: 
The City has recognized an issue with on-street parking on Commerce Street from Mercer Parkway 
to LBJ frontage road.  Commerce Street is a collector street intended to carry traffic out of the west 
side development area.  The design of the roadway allows for a maximum of 3 lanes.  The current 
configuration is one lane in both north and south direction with a turn lane at the north end intersection 
with Mercer Parkway.  The configuration does not allow for parking on either side of the roadway, 
however, due to the number of apartment complexes being built adjacent to the roadway, parking on 
the roadway has become an issue. 
DISCUSSION:
In the interest of traffic safety and to allow better traffic movement along Commerce Street, City staff 
and the Police Department have determined vehicles parked along both sides of the street creates a 
hazard for traffic entering and exiting Commerce Street at Mercer Parkway and creates nonstandard 
narrowed travel lanes for safe two-way traffic.  
RECOMMENDATION:
City Staff and the Police Chief recommends amending the Code of Ordinances by establishing a no 
parking zone along both sides of Commerce Street from Mercer Parkway to LBJ Frontage Road.
POSSIBLE COUNCIL ACTION:
1. I move to adopt Ordinance No. 3639 amending the City of Farmers Branch Code of Ordinances, 
Chapter 82, Traffic and Vehicles, Article II, Division 6, Section 82-95, amending No Parking Zones 
on Commerce Street.
2. I move to adopt Ordinance No. 3639 amending the City of Farmers Branch Code of Ordinances, 
Chapter 82, Traffic and Vehicles, Article II, Division 6, Section 82-95, amending No Parking Zones

3. I move to table the issue for further study or take no action.

DATE:

SUBJECT: 
Architectural Services for Phase One of Recreation Center Renovation Project 
 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
The FY2019-20 budget includes funding for the first phase of the Recreation Center  
Renovation Project (“Project”) and supports the City of Farmers Branch Critical Business 
Outcome – Plan to, build, and maintain high quality public assets. The budget for the Project 
is $1,925,000.  
 
The first phase of the renovation is focused on the first floor of the Recreation Center, which 
includes: 
 West gym  
 Front entrance and hall corridors 
 Children’s area 
 Meeting rooms and Kitchen 
 Restrooms  
 Office areas  
 
The next step in the Project is the architectural design of the west gym; front entrance-hall 
corridors, and children’s area, which includes design, construction plans, project bidding, and 
construction design oversite.  An architect is necessary for this part of the project due to the 
following: 
 State requirement for public buildings for projects over $50,000 when alterations 
require the removal, relocation or addition of walls or partitions. 
 Size and complexity    
 Due to the unique design proposed in all three areas an architect will also need 
to use a lighting consultant to be sure that proper light is dispersed throughout 
the space without exceeding that permitted by the energy code. 
 Modifications to both electrical and mechanical will require code research and 
coordination 
 The complexity of the proposed modifications in all three areas will best be 
evaluated and designed in a 3-D model form in order to minimize conflicts 
and discrepancies between mechanical, electrical, structural and interior 
design. 
 It will require the use of mechanical and electrical engineers since the HVAC 
system in at least two of the three spaces will be modified and the electrical in 
all three areas will be significantly altered as well. 
 Due to the extent of the project, the cost and significant modifications an 
architect will need to meet with a code official to be sure that the building still 
meets the code requirements applicable to this renovation. This may include 
life safety type issues such as exiting from the building and complying with 
accessibility requirements. 
 
 
Facilities Management will separately manage the work in the meeting rooms, kitchen, 
restrooms and office areas.  Quorum Architects, Inc. will provide the finishes and color 
selections for the bid packages for these areas to ensure a consistent look.  These will be 
brought back to council separately at a future date.

The City of Farmers requested a proposal from Quorum Architects, Inc. for the design,

RE:  Farmers Branch Recreation Center  
 
Design and Construction Administration 
 
Quorum No: 19174.01 
 
Dear Kevin, 
 
Quorum Architects, Inc. is pleased to submit this proposal for design and construction 
administration for spaces within the Farmers Branch Community Recreation Center Design 
and Construction. We have provided herein a detailed description of each proposed task 
based on our preliminary project understanding and discussions. We are available to discuss 
our proposal at your convenience. 
 
Below we have summarized our understanding of the project scope, fee and deliverables to 
clearly communicate expectations of each party.  For budgeting purposes as well as for the 
purpose of providing a general baseline for this proposal, we are assuming our scope of work 
will be limited to the following areas: 1) the Lobby, reception desk, and main corridors, 2) the 
Gym / fitness area, and 3) the Children’s area, and will be based generally upon the renderings 
provided in February.  Additionally, Quorum will provide a list of recommended materials and 
colors for the ground level restrooms to compliment the work in the areas under our scope. 
It is our understanding that the City will be having the demolition work done outside of our 
scope while we are designing the improvements, and that the City will perform design and 
construction for the community rooms and restrooms using the material selection provided 
by Quorum. If there are significant changes in direction from the City following the 
preliminary Design, changes to this Basic Services scope and compensation may become 
necessary due to a change in scope for us or our consultants.  Upon approval of the proposal, 
and prior to beginning Basic Services, the Architect and Client agree to enter into an 
Agreement between Owner and Architect (AIA Document B101) as agreed upon by both 
parties for more detailed scope definition. 
 
BASIC SERVICES  
 
Design Development – Based on the mutually agreed upon program, schedule and 
construction budget requirements, the Architect shall prepare, for approval by the Owner, 
Design Development Documents consisting of drawings and other documents illustrating the 
scale and relationship of Project components.  Architect will utilize related unit costs for 
similarly constructed facilities recently designed by Quorum as a basis for using square foot 
 
 
Quorum
costing methods. Design Development Documents consisting of drawings and other 
documents shall fix and describe the size and character of the Project as to architectural, 
structural, mechanical and electrical systems, materials and such other elements as may be 
appropriate. Generally, most of the drawing sheets will be started as well as most 
specification sections, although the details of each will be completed during Construction 
Document development. 
 
Construction Documents – Based on the approved Design Development Documents and any 
further adjustments in the scope or quality of the Project or in the construction budget 
authorized by the Owner, the Architect shall prepare, for approval by the Owner, 
Construction Documents consisting of Drawings and Specifications setting forth the 
requirements for the construction of the project. The Architect shall advise the Owner of any 
adjustments to previous preliminary estimates of Construction Cost indicated by changes in 
requirements or general market conditions.  The Architect shall assist the Owner in 
preparation of the necessary bidding information, bidding forms, the Conditions of the 
Contract, and the form of Agreement between the Owner and Contractor.  It is anticipated 
that the Owner will utilize a competitive sealed proposal process for bidding and will provide 
the Architect in a value rating system for evaluation of proposals. Architect will assist in 
permit application and submission with final permit being obtained in the name of the 
selected general contractor. One rendering will be included in Basic Services 
 
Bidding – The Architect will assist the Owner in bidding, including attending Pre-proposal 
meeting, development of addenda as necessary and answering contractor RFI’s, questions of 
clarifications on the Documents, and other concerns.  Architect will also review and analyze 
proposals, and provide an evaluation letter for final contractor selection by the City. 
 
Construction Administration –The Architect shall provide administration of the Contract for 
Construction as set forth in the General Conditions of the Contract for Construction, unless 
otherwise provided in this Agreement.  The Architect, as a representative of the Owner, shall 
visit the site at intervals appropriate to the stage of the Contractor’s operations, or as 
otherwise agreed by the Owner and the Architect, (1) to become generally familiar with and 
to keep the Owner informed about the progress and quality of the portion of the Work 
completed, (2) to endeavor to guard the Owner against defects and deficiencies in the Work, 
and (3) to determine, in general, if the Work is being performed in a manner indicating that 
the Work, when fully completed, will be in accordance with the Contract Documents.  
However, the Architect shall not be required to make exhaustive or continuous on-site 
inspections to check the quality or quantity of the Work.   
 
For the purpose of this proposal, we have assumed a maximum of 12 site visits over a four 
(4) month construction period, including a pre-construction meeting and two (2) final review 
visits. Additional visits may be performed as Additional Services.

TDLR RAS or preferred RAS of choice by the Client.

Agenda Number: H.1
Conduct a public hearing and consider adopting Ordinance No. 3636 to amend 
the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance including but not limited to amending: 
Article 2.6 Alcoholic Beverage Sales in Restaurants and Private Clubs, Article 
3.21 Light Industrial District, Article 3.22 Heavy Industrial District, and Article 4.5 
Performance Standards as it relates to uses and development standards 
requiring approval of a Specific Use Permit; and take appropriate action
BACKGROUND: 
This is a city initiated Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (CZO) text amendment. City Council directed 
staff to consider removing Specific Use Permit requirements from the CZO that may no longer be 
necessary or the most appropriate means for regulating certain uses and/or improvements. The last 
major overhaul of the CZO was adopted by City Council in January of 2017 and included a thorough 
review of the land uses subject to approval of a specific use permit. However, there still remains 
provisions within the CZO that require approval of an SUP particularly as it relates to development 
standards; therefore, staff has focused its review on the development performance standards. The 
following items listed below are proposed for removal of the SUP requirement and clarification of 
existing requirements:
·
Outdoor patio areas associated with qualifying restaurants;
·
More than two driveway approaches for properties located within Light Industrial (LI) and 
Heavy Industrial (HI) zoning districts; and
·
The amount of open storage allowed by right versus that which requires approval of an SUP.
Staff presented this proposed CZO amendment to the Planning and Zoning Commission at a study 
session discussion during their February 10, 2020 regular meeting. The Commission was agreeable to 
the proposal and advised staff to proceed with the public hearing and ordinance adoption process. 
The proposed amending ordinance is attached with this staff report. 
RECOMMENDATION:
On May 11, 2020 Planning and Zoning Commission considered this request and unanimously 
recommended approval of the Zoning request as presented in Ordinance No. 3636.

SUBJECT: 
Conduct a public hearing and consider adopting Ordinance No. 3636 to amend the 
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance including but not limited to amending: Article 
2.6 Alcoholic Beverage Sales in Restaurants and Private Clubs, Article 3.21 Light 
Industrial District, Article 3.22 Heavy Industrial District, and Article 4.5 
Performance Standards as it relates to uses and development standards requiring 
approval of a Specific Use Permit; and take appropriate action. 
 
 
Background: 
 
This is a city initiated Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (CZO) text amendment. City Council 
directed staff to consider removing Specific Use Permit requirements from the CZO that may no 
longer be necessary or the most appropriate means for regulating certain uses and/or 
improvements. The last major overhaul of the CZO was adopted by City Council in January of 
2017 and included a thorough review of the land uses subject to approval of a specific use permit. 
However, there still remains provisions within the CZO that require approval of an SUP 
particularly as it relates to development standards; therefore, staff has focused its review on the 
development performance standards. The following items listed below are proposed for removal 
of the SUP requirement and clarification of existing requirements: 
 
 Outdoor patio areas associated with qualifying restaurants; 
 More than two driveway approaches for properties located within Light Industrial (LI) and 
Heavy Industrial (HI) zoning districts; and 
 The amount of open storage allowed by right versus that which requires approval of an 
SUP. 
 
Staff presented this proposed CZO amendment to the Planning and Zoning Commission at a study 
session discussion during their February 10, 2020 regular meeting. The Commission was agreeable 
to the proposal and advised staff to proceed with the public hearing and ordinance adoption 
process. The proposed amending ordinance is attached with this staff report.  
Proposed Amendments: 
 
Staff has identified the following provisions within the CZO to discuss removal or clarification of 
the SUP requirement. 
 
A. Qualifying Restaurants 
 
The CZO defines qualifying restaurants as an existing or proposed eating establishment whose 
gross sale of food and non-alcoholic beverages shall constitute at least 50% of the establishment's 
combined gross sales of food, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages quarterly. The CZO allows 
qualifying restaurant by right in the Local Retail District-1 (LR-1), Local Retail District-2 (LR-2), 
Commercial (C), Light Industrial (LI) and Heavy Industrial (HI) zoning districts pursuant to 
requirements in Section 2.6 which includes provisions related to alcoholic beverage sales, 
structural and building requirements, food service regulations, application and submittal criteria, 
and alcohol awareness program. Additionally, Section 2.6 requires approval of an SUP for the sale 
of alcoholic beverage within an outdoor patio, as provided for below: 
 
2.6 Alcoholic beverage sales in restaurants and private clubs 
F. Food Service  
3. A qualifying restaurant may provide service in an attached patio or garden 
subject to approval of a specific use permit by the City Council.  
As previously mentioned, the CZO allows qualifying restaurant by right in the LR-1, LR-2, C, LI 
and HI zoning districts. However, the aforementioned provision requiring approval of an SUP for 
an attached patio with a qualifying restaurant defeats the intent of the CZO to allow qualifying 
restaurants by right. Staff believes it is appropriate to remove the SUP requirement for the attached 
patio with qualifying restaurants. If the location allows a qualifying restaurant by right through the 
base zoning district, then the attached patio should not be required to go through an SUP approval 
process as it is part of the main land use, i.e. the restaurant. 
 
B. Access Drive Approaches 
 
Article 3. Zoning District Dimensional Standards of the CZO includes standards that regulate 
siting and massing of structures on a property. For each zoning district there are additional notes 
(or provisions) listing unique development standards applicable to that particular zoning district, 
outside of the height or siting standards. There are two such provisions within LI and HI zoning 
districts that has an SUP approval requirement for access drive approaches, specifically sites 
wanting more than two drive approaches. 
 
3.21 LI (Light Industrial District) 
Notes 
5. Two approach driveways not exceeding 40 feet in width each may be located in 
the front yard. Additional driveways require approval of a specific use permit in 
accordance with Section 6.5.  
 
 
3.22 HI (Heavy Industrial District) 
Notes 
6. Two approach driveways not exceeding 40 feet in width each may be located in 
the front yard. Additional driveways require approval of a specific use permit 
pursuant to Section 6.5. 
Currently driveway spacing, maximum number of driveways, driveway location and other site 
design related items are reviewed on a case by case basis through the city’s detailed site plan 
review process. The city’s Public Works Department follows engineering best management 
practices and standards for these site design elements. As a result, there is no need for having 
maximum number, width or location of driveways within the LI or HI zoning districts being subject 
to approval of an SUP to design otherwise. These standards can unintentionally contradict optimal 
site layout and configuration based on engineering best management practices. Furthermore, the 
SUP process should be reserved for evaluating the appropriateness of land uses within a zoning 
district, including but not limited to land use impacts on adjacent properties, compatibility of uses, 
and use operations. Therefore, staff recommends these two SUP requirements should be removed 
from the CZO. 
C. Open Storage 
Article 4. Site Development Standards of the CZO has requirements related to how open storage 
may be provided on a property. The open storage provisions stated below require clarification, as 
through ordinance amendments over the years, the ordinance language might have lost some of its 
original clarity related to the amount of open storage allowed by right on a property versus the 
amount which triggers approval of an SUP.  
4.5 Performance Standards  
B. C, LI and PD Districts 
8. Open Storage  
b. The area designated as open storage shall not exceed 15% of the total 
gross square foot of the building located on the same lot as the open storage 
prior to approval of a specific use permit in accordance with Section 6.5. 
C. HI District 
8. Open Storage  
b. The area designated as open storage shall not exceed the total gross 
square foot of the building located on the same lot as the open storage area 
prior to approval of a specific use permit in accordance with Section 6.5. 
This CZO requirement of restricting open storage on site is to control nuisance and aesthetic issues 
of any operation. There has been a need to clarify the “15%” provision within the C and LI districts 
as the statement is confusing in determining when the SUP requirement is triggered. Based on past 
review of the city’s CZO prior to the ordinance being amended in 2017, the equivalent up to 15% 
of building floor area was allowed as open storage by right, and any amount of open storage 
exceeding 15% required approval of an SUP. Therefore, staff proposes to amend the language as 
follows: 
 
b. The area designated as of open storage authorized by right pursuant to paragraph a, 
above, shall not exceed 15% of the total gross square footage of the area of the building(s) 
located on the same lot and to which such outside storage constitutes an accessory use as 
the open storage. Use of an area for open storage exceeding 15% of the total gross square 
footage of the area of the building(s) on the same lot and to which such outside storage 
constitutes an accessory use shall require prior to approval of a specific use permit in 
accordance with Section 6.5. 
 
Similar clarification is proposed for the open storage provision in the HI zoning district as 
follows: 
 
b. The area designated as of open storage authorized by right pursuant to paragraph a, 
above, shall not exceed the total gross square footage of the area of the building(s) located 
on the same lot and to which such outside storage constitutes an accessory use as the open 
storage area. Use of an area for open storage exceeding the total gross square footage of 
the building(s) on the same lot and to which such outside storage constitutes an accessory 
use shall require prior to approval of a specific use permit in accordance with Section 6.5.

no changes are proposed to the screening requirements (i.e. minimum 6-ft/maximum 8-ft tall 
masonry wall and landscaping). 
 
Comprehensive Plan Recommendation:  
 
The City of Farmers Branch comprehensive plan is comprised of the West Side Plan, Central Area 
Plan, and East Side Plan.  Each of these comprehensive plans recognize zoning as one of the most 
important tools to accomplish the land use goals and objectives of these long range plans’ 
recommendations. The East Side Plan states that zoning restrictions and complicated alcohol 
regulations are a significant barrier to entry for new businesses. By removing the unwarranted SUP 
requirement from the CZO, the proposed amendment is consistent with the Plan’s 
recommendations, thereby allowing for streamlined development review process. The amendment 
encourages new and re-development projects by reducing application review and processing time.  
 
Public Response:  
 
The required public hearing notice was published in the Dallas Morning News on May 22, 2020.  
No zoning notification signs nor mailed notices are required for amendments to the CZO.  Staff 
has received no correspondence related to this proposed CZO amendment. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
On May 11, 2020 Planning and Zoning Commission considered this request and unanimously 
recommended approval of the Zoning request as presented in Ordinance No. 3636. 
Possible Council Action: 
1. Motion to adopt Ordinance No. 3636. 
2. Motion to adopt Ordinance No. 3636 with the following modifications… 
3. Motion to deny Ordinance No. 3636. 
4. Motion to continue discussion at the next meeting.

D. PUBLIC HEARING 
 
D.1       20-ZA-03          Conduct a public hearing and consider a request to amend the  
                                      Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance including but not limited to     
                                      amending: Article 2.6 Alcoholic Beverage Sales in Restaurants and  
                                      Private Clubs, Article 3.21 Light Industrial District, Article 3.22 Heavy  
                                      Industrial District, and Article 4.5 Performance Standards as it relates  
                                      to uses and development standards requiring approval of a Specific   
                                      Use Permit; and take appropriate action. 
 
This is a city initiated Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (CZO) text amendment. City 
Council directed staff to consider removing Specific Use Permit requirements from the 
CZO that may no longer be necessary or the most appropriate means for regulating 
certain uses and/or improvements. The last major overhaul of the CZO was adopted by 
City Council in January of 2017 and included a thorough review of the land uses 
subject to approval of a specific use permit. However, there still remains provisions 
within the CZO that require approval of an SUP particularly as it relates to development 
standards; therefore, staff has focused its review on the development performance 
standards. The following items listed below are proposed for removal of the SUP 
requirement and clarification of existing requirements: 
 
 
Outdoor patio areas associated with qualifying restaurants; 
 
 
More than two driveway approaches for properties located within Light 
City Hall

Staff presented this proposed CZO amendment to the Planning and Zoning 
Commission at a study session discussion during their February 10, 2020 regular 
meeting. The Commission was agreeable to the proposal and advised staff to proceed 
with the public hearing and ordinance adoption process. Staff recommends approval of 
this zoning amendment as presented.

June 9, 2020 –Agenda Item X.x
CZO Text Amendment – Specific Use Permit
•
City Council directed staff to consider removing Specific Use Permit requirements 
from the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (CZO) that may no longer be necessary or 
the most appropriate means for regulating certain uses and/or improvements. 
•
The following items are proposed for possible removal of the SUP requirement 
and/or clarification of existing requirements:
•
Outdoor patio areas associated with qualifying restaurants;
•
More than two driveway approaches for properties located within Light 
Industrial (LI) and Heavy Industrial (HI) zoning districts; and
•
The amount of open storage allowed by right versus that which requires 
approval of an SUP.
CZO Text Amendment – Specific Use Permit
Qualifying Restaurants:
•
The CZO allows qualifying restaurant by right in the Local Retail District-1 (LR-1), 
Local Retail District-2 (LR-2), Commercial (C), Light Industrial (LI) and Heavy 
Industrial (HI) zoning districts.
•
However, Section 2.6 of the CZO requires approval of an SUP for the sale of 
alcoholic beverage within an outdoor patio of a qualifying restaurant.
•
Staff believes it is appropriate to remove this SUP requirement.
•
If the location allows a qualifying restaurant by right through the base zoning 
district, then the attached patio should not be required to go through an SUP 
approval process as it is part of the main land use, i.e. the restaurant.
CZO Text Amendment – Specific Use Permit
Access Drive Approaches:
•
There are two provisions within LI and HI zoning districts that has an SUP 
approval requirement:
Two approach driveways not exceeding 40 feet in width each may be located 
in the front yard. Additional driveways require approval of a specific use 
permit in accordance with Section 6.5.
• Currently driveway spacing, maximum number of driveways, driveway location 
and other site design related items are reviewed on a case by case basis through 
the city’s detailed site plan review process. 
• The city’s Public Works Department follows engineering best management 
practices standards and has individual standards for these site design elements. 
• Staff recommends removal of these two SUP requirements.
CZO Text Amendment – Specific Use Permit
Open Storage:
• Article 4. Site Development Standards of the CZO has requirements related to 
how open storage may be provided on a property needs clarification. 
Existing Open Storage Requirement (C, LI)
Proposed Amendment
The area designated as open storage shall not 
exceed 15% of the total gross square foot of the 
building located on the same lot as the open 
storage prior to approval of a specific use permit 
in accordance with Section 6.5.
The area of open storage authorized by right 
pursuant to paragraph a, above, shall not exceed 
15% of the total gross square footage of the area 
of the building(s) located on the same lot and to 
which such outside storage constitutes an 
accessory use. Use of an area for open storage 
exceeding 15% of the total gross square footage 
of the area of the building(s) located on the same 
lot and to which such outside storage constitutes 
an accessory use shall require prior approval of a 
specific use permit in accordance with Section 
6.5.
CZO Text Amendment – Specific Use Permit
Comprehensive Plan (Central Area Plan) Recommendation:
•
The East Side Plan states that zoning restrictions and complicated alcohol regulations 
are a significant barrier to entry for new businesses. 
•
By removing the unwarranted SUP requirement from the CZO, the proposed 
amendment is consistent with the Plan’s recommendations, thereby allowing for 
streamlined development review process. 
•
The amendment encourages new and re-development projects by reducing 
application review and processing time. 
Planning and Zoning Commission Recommendation:
•
On May 11, 2020 the Commission unanimously recommended approval of the CZO 
amendment.

File Number: ORD-3640
Agenda Date: 6/9/2020  
Status: Regular Agenda
File Type: Ordinance
In Control: City Council
Agenda Number: I.1
Consider adopting Ordinance No. 3640 authorizing the City Manager to execute 
an agreement for rooftop solar projects for Manske Library, the Farmers Branch 
Community Recreation Center, and the new Fire Station #2; and take appropriate 
action 
BACKGROUND: 
On May 19, 2020 City Council received a report from City staff and Adam Shor with Shor Power 
and Dan Poydenis with Sea Oak Capital regarding the feasibility of solar rooftop projects at various 
City facilities and a solar project at the City’s closed landfill at 1399 Valley View Lane. Council 
received conservative cost estimates and revenue projections at this presentation. Council asked that 
the costs for three projects be refined and brought back for further consideration.
This presentation provides updated costs and revenue projections for the three projects. 
DISCUSSION:
Based on model assumptions and cost estimates, the potential for rooftop solar projects at the 
Manske Library, Farmers Branch Community Recreation Center, and the new Fire Station #2 on 
Alpha Link would save the City money on its electrical bills over the terms of the projects. The 
projects have an estimated combined total cost of $1,286,000, net incentives. The project terms are 
30 years. Each project has qualified and is currently approved for an incentive from ONCOR, which 
would offset some of the construction costs of the projects. Based on the models, all three projects 
have payback periods of less than 10 years. 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
(Choose One)
1.
Financial impacts are described in the attachments. 
RECOMMENDATION:
City Administration recommends adopting Ordinance No. 3640 authorizing the City Manager to 
amend the Fiscal Year 2019-20 Operations and Capital Improvement Budget and execute 
agreements for rooftop solar projects for Manske Library, the Farmers Branch Community Recreation 
Center, and the new Fire Station #2. The amended budget would transfer the estimated project costs 
of $1,286,000 from General Fund reserves to Operations and Capital Improvements Budget. 
POSSIBLE COUNCIL ACTION:

Solar Feasibility Study 
 
Prepared for: 
The City of Farmers Branch, TX 
 
April 14th, 2020 
 
Based on the summary of our feasibility analysis, it is feasible for the City to build solar on 
several of the City-owned buildings, predominantly those with a larger rooftop area, and 
evaluate the inclusion of solar from the potential solar landfill project during its ongoing 
discussions with retail electricity providers for the City’s next long term electricity contract.  We 
have secured an Oncor subsidy for a portion of the rooftop projects in the amount of $313,000 
which will assist the City in its execution of the rooftop projects.  We recommend the City 
pursue a self-ownership model of the rooftop projects and pursue a third-party ownership 
model of the landfill project.  Should the City agree with our findings that the projects are 
feasible, the next step would be to complete the development of the projects so that the 
estimates herein can be refined to reflect actual costs and numbers which can then be relied 
upon for installation of the projects.

Definition of Terminology 
 
“Behind the Meter” – A behind the meter generation system is a solar project that produces power on the 
actual facility that is using the electricity, rather than on the grid side of the meter.  The meter is physically 
located at the connection of the grid and the building, hence “behind the meter” refers to a project that is 
sited on the building side of the meter. 
 
“In Front of the Meter” – An in front of the meter generation system is a solar project that produces power 
that is fed directly into the grid.  The power flows from the project, to the grid, through the meter and into 
the building or electricity use case.   
 
Qualified Scheduling Entity – Qualified scheduling entities (QSEs) submit bids and offers on behalf of resource 
entities or load serving entities (LSEs) such as retail electric providers (REPs).1 
 
“REP” – Retail Electricity Provider – A Retail Electric Provider (REP) sells electric energy to retail customers in 
the areas of Texas where the sale of electricity is open to retail competition. A REP buys wholesale electricity, 
delivery service, and related services, prices electricity for customers, and seeks customers to buy electricity 
at retail.2 
 
“Load Serving Entity” - Load Serving Entities (LSEs) provide electric service to individual and wholesale 
Customers. LSEs include Competitive Retailers and Non-Opt-In Entities.3 
 
“Interconnection Study” – A preliminary study performed by the transmitting utility (Oncor) to determine 
what equipment at what cost would be required to safely and reliably interconnect a solar project to Oncor’s 
transmission system. 
 
“Interconnection” – The equipment and facilities required to safely and reliably interconnect a solar project 
to the transmission system of the transmitting utility. 
 
“EPC” – Engineering, Procurement, and Construction firm responsible for the engineering design, 
procurement of hardware, and physical construction of a solar project. 
 
“TDSP” - TDU/TDSP Delivery Charges are charges assessed by a Transmission and Distribution Utility (TDU) for 
the delivery of electricity to a customer over poles and wires and through other TDU facilities. Though these 
charges are assessed to the Retail Electric Provider (REP) and not the consumer directly, REPs may itemize 
these charges on consumers' electric bills.4 
 
“PPA” – Power Purchase Agreement – This is a contract that an electricity buyer signs to purchase the power 
from a solar project. 
 
“TCEQ” – Texas Commission on Environmental Quality – This is the State governmental body that oversees 
any proposed development on existing or capped landfills in the State of Texas.

City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study

Summary of Findings 
 
Shor Power and Sea Oak Capital are pleased to present our findings to the City of Farmers Branch 
(the “City”) in relation to the solar feasibility study for the City buildings, properties and available 
land.   
 
To begin the study, we spoke with members of the City local government including, but not 
limited to, the Mayor, Sustainability Manager, and the Fleet and Facilities Director to understand 
the long-term sustainability objectives, broader City goals, and the hypothesis that solar could 
help reduce the electricity expenses of the City.  Once the objectives of the study were defined, 
we divided our efforts into two opportunity segments: potential rooftop solar systems and 
potential ground mounted solar systems. These different types of systems have implications with 
respect to size, cost, interconnection feasibility, structural requirements, available incentives, 
and market regulatory dynamics.  This feasibility report will provide the results of evaluating both 
rooftop and ground mounted solar systems within the City. 
 
For the rooftop projects, we began by evaluating the total electricity usage for all of the City’s 
buildings, in addition to the area of available roof space on each building.  The electricity demand 
of each building dictates how much power there is to potentially offset via solar, and the available 
roof space effectively acts as a limiting factor with respect to how large of a system can be 
installed on each rooftop.  After reviewing each City building, we created a shortlist of buildings 
in which the size of the potential solar system installed relative to the power that it would 
generate would likely create electricity savings for the City.   
 
This shortlist of buildings included City Hall, Manske Library, Farmers Branch Community 
Recreation Center, Margaret Young Natatorium, Children’s Health Stars Center, and the new Fire 
Station on Alpha Road.  We collaborated with a local contractor to perform a structural review 
of the roof construction on each of these buildings (except for the Fire Station) to determine load 
bearing capability. All buildings passed the initial structural review, after which we had a solar 
system designed for each rooftop explicitly.  These project designs were then submitted 
concurrently to Oncor for proposed interconnection and to the Oncor Solar Photovoltaic 
Standard Offer Program for the purpose of securing an allocation of grant funds from Oncor that 
could help offset the cost to the City for the solar projects on a project-specific basis.  The projects 
proposed for City Hall, Manske Library, Farmers Branch Community Recreation Center, and the 
Margaret Young Natatorium all received favorable outcomes with respect to the proposed 
interconnection and are currently in “Interconnection Agreement Available” status, which 
enables the projects to proceed, should the City elect to do so.  More importantly, the four 
projects in this interconnection status have all individually received an allocation of grant funding 
from Oncor which totals approximately $313,000 across the four projects.  The grant funds will 
be made available in the event the City elects to move forward with building the projects this 
calendar year.  The new Fire Station on Alpha Road is on the wait list for potential grant funding 
from Oncor in the event that more funds become available.

Concurrently with the rooftop review, the primary piece of land we evaluated within the City is 
the capped landfill co-located at 1399 Valley View Lane with the Farmers Branch Citizens 
Collection Center.  Per our review, the site can hold a slighter greater than 5MWdc solar array, 
which equates to a 4.5MWac solar project. To put this in perspective, this is roughly 23.5 times 
the size of the system proposed for the rooftop of the Manske Library. This project would be 
considered “in front of the meter” whereas each of the rooftop projects would be considered 
“behind the meter.” The difference between the two is explained later within this report. Due to 
regulatory requirements in Oncor territory, should the City elect to move forward with this 
4.5MWac solar project, the project would require a “Qualified Scheduling Entity” and a “Load 
Serving Entity” to interface between the electrical grid and the City electricity demands.  We have 
determined from our review that the project is tentatively feasible, dependent on the economics 
of the long-term electricity contract that the City would sign with the landfill solar project, as well 
as with the next electricity contract that the City is currently planning to secure.  
 
The City is a member of the Governmental Aggregation Project, Inc. (GAP), a political subdivision 
corporation. GAP assists the City with contracting for electricity as well as other electricity-related 
projects, such as budgeting and reporting. GAP reviewed the evaluation of the solar project and 
their comments have been included in this report.  In making this determination for the landfill 
solar project, we collaborated with a national engineering, procurement, and construction group 
to do the preliminary design work for the project.  This work was submitted in the landfill 
interconnection impact study, which came back favorably with a cost of ~$275,000 to 
interconnect the project, which is low compared to other projects of similar scale across the 
country.   
 
Communication with Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) suggests that with a 
defined engineering plan, it would be relatively easy to get their approval to build on the capped 
landfill.  There are no local incentives that could be applied to the landfill project, but the project 
itself does achieve meaningful economies of scale relative to the rooftop projects, as the project 
cost per Watt installed is lower.  However, the contracts associated with the landfill project will 
be more complicated than the rooftop “behind the meter” projects.   
 
Based on the summary of our analysis, it is feasible for the City to build solar on several of the 
City-owned buildings, predominantly those with a larger rooftop area, and evaluate the 
inclusion of solar from the potential solar landfill project during its ongoing discussions with 
retail electricity providers for the City’s next long term electricity contract.  The potential 
~8,300,000 kWh generated from the proposed solar projects would represent ~64% of the 
City’s 2019 electricity usage of ~13,000,000 kWh. 
 
We appreciate the consideration to assist the City in this opportunity.

Initial System Designs 
 
As part of the feasibility analysis of each potential location, design engineers at Native Solar, a 
Texas based rooftop solar EPC, analyzed each City location under consideration and prepared 
layouts of a proposed solar facility. Best design practices commonly used in the solar industry 
were observed, including but not limited to identification of current roof obstructions and 
skylights, safety considerations such as setbacks from the edge of the roof and spacing between 
rows of panels, and performance considerations such as roof slope, shading and configuration.  
A simplified explanation of how these systems would work is immediately below for reference.5

Landfill Proposed Solar Layout 
 
 
 
The layouts prepared for the initial system designs consist of what is commonly referred to as a 
“30% design set.”  This indicates that the layout is generally about 30% of the way through the 
engineering and design process that would ordinarily occur to obtain a building and electrical 
permit, and for an EPC contractor to rely upon during a construction process.   
 
If the City were to proceed with the projects above, an independent engineer would be engaged 
to review and comment on the design and engineering drawings of the EPC contractor.  
Customarily, a refreshed 30% drawing would be presented for review and comment by the City 
and an independent engineer followed by 60% and 90% progress sets of drawings for review and 
comment prior to agreeing upon the final construction set.  During this process, optimization and 
advanced engineering would refine the design of the solar systems to reach the best cost-benefit 
system for the City.   
 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
11 
While this process will likely result in changes to the numbers set forth above, it is customary to 
conduct feasibility analysis on a 30% set of drawings.   
 
In terms of the forecasted system performance, we anticipate an industry standard approximate 
.5% degradation of the system output year over year.  For example, if the first year estimated 
kWh for the City Hall is 129,711, we would anticipate year 2 generates 129,062 (Y1 * .995%).  
 
The momentum in the solar industry is toward a 35-year useful life.  Generally, projects start with 
a 35-year assumption and then shorten it if appropriate for various site-specific reasons. For 
example, if a certain location is believed to require a roof replacement in year 30, and the cost 
to decommissioning and reinstall the solar facility was cost prohibitive, then the useful life would 
be reduced to 30 years to track the amount of time the City believes the solar system can be in 
operation.   
Analysis of the current electrical rate and potential future rates if solar 
projects are implemented 
 
Current Rate 
The City currently pays an “all-in” averaged price of ~$.11301/kWh for electricity across all of its 
buildings and other electricity uses (e.g. streetlights).  The “all-in” pricing refers to both the 
electricity and Oncor’s charges for transmission, distribution, demand and other customer and 
metering charges (“TDSPs”). Breaking that down, the TDSP represent on average roughly 
$.0618 cents of the $.11301 cents per kWh total. Excluding the TDSPs charged for street 
lighting, the TDSP charges represent $.04301 cents per kWh on average.  TDSP charges are 
specific for each electricity use within the City. From our discussions with various Retail 
Electricity Providers as well as the City’s electricity contract consultant, GAP, the average 
electricity rate of $.04971 cents per kWh included in the $.11301 cents per kWh may be slightly 
reduced in the next contract the City signs with a Retail Electricity Provider due purely to a 
potential drop in underlying electricity rates. Preliminary bids that GAP has solicited for the 
City’s next electricity contract suggest an average electricity rate reduction of $.008 cents per 
kWh, bringing the average electricity rate to approximately ~$.041 cents per kWh. Again, this 
electricity rate is not inclusive of TDSP charges.  Given the time between these initial indications 
and when a contract will be ultimately signed, this is merely an early indication of where the 
City’s electricity rate will fall. 
 
Projected Rate(s) for projects and why 
The rate that the City will pay in its next long-term contract for electricity with a Retail  
Electricity Provider is still to be determined through the efforts of the City’s consultant GAP.  
Assuming that the rates will trend down from where they are today, and in order to sustain 
savings from a possible solar installation within the City, the levelized cost of electricity6 for the 
                                                 
6 Levelized cost of electricity is by definition the approximate rate of electricity that is achieved by dividing 
the cost of the system and associated cost to maintain the system by the amount of power the system will 
produce over its usable lifetime, which is generally 30 years for a rooftop solar system. 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
12 
rooftop solar projects will likely need to be in the $.07 cents per kWh range. This is based on an 
assumption of City ownership of the rooftop projects and the fact that the rooftop solar offsets 
both the electricity rate as well as the transmission and distribution rate, i.e. the “all-in” rate 
referenced above.  With assistance from GAP, we’ve been able to determine the average TDSP 
charges for the buildings being evaluated for solar is roughly $.024 cents per kWh.  Adding that 
to the average electricity rate of ~.$049 cents per kWh, this equates to ~ $.073 cents per kWh 
for electricity and TDSP charges for each of the buildings.   This is due to the fact that from the 
electrical grid’s perspective, the rooftop solar is just part of the building, and it thereby reduces 
the demand that the grid experiences from the respective building that has solar installed on it.  
This reduction in the electricity required by the building simultaneously reduces the number of 
kWh that is required to be delivered to the building. Therefore, in order to achieve savings with 
the rooftop systems, the levelized cost of electricity from those systems must be compared to 
the electricity rate plus the TDSPs from Oncor that GAP will assist the City in achieving via the 
next electricity contract.   
 
The economics of the proposed landfill project are slightly different, given that the landfill is “in 
front of the meter.” This means that the project delivers power to the grid before delivering 
power to the user of the electricity.  Given the regulatory environment that this project would 
exist under, the City could sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the landfill project at a 
specified rate whereby the City would contractually agree to buy the power produced by the 
proposed solar project on the landfill.  This rate would be explicit to the electrical component of 
the “all-in” pricing that the City ultimately sees on its bill from its Retail Electricity Provider.  
Said differently, the PPA rate for solar from the landfill project would not be inclusive of the 
transmission and distribution charges levied by Oncor.  Thus, in order to achieve savings from 
the proposed landfill solar project, the PPA rate would likely need to be in the range of $.05-.06 
cents per kWh, which does not include the $.0618 cents per kWh for TDSP charges from Oncor.   
The landfill project is significantly more influenced by the regulatory requirements than the 
rooftop projects.  We will provide more details on the regulations in the section below. 
Summary of the permitting process(es) and associated costs with 
regulatory agencies (e.g. ONCOR, TCEQ, City) 
There are several permitting processes associated with building solar projects, all of which 
depend on where the project is located and how the project would ultimately be built and 
connected to the grid.  The foremost process is interconnection permitting.  This takes place via 
Oncor, the utility that controls the operation of the grid for the City and surrounding areas.   
 
Oncor 
To begin with, we communicated with two Oncor employees, Sam Widhalm, Senior Engineer in 
the Assets Planning, DG Resource Integration group, and Jerry Bates, Area Manager, 
Oncor/Customer Relations.  Sam was our primary point of contact for all aspects associated with 
interconnection.  He helped oversee the pre-screen, which was an internal Oncor initial 
evaluation on whether any of the proposed projects would be difficult to interconnect.  Once the 
pre-screen came back with positive initial results, we determined it would be sufficient to move 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
13 
forward to full interconnection applications for each of the proposed rooftop projects, as well as 
the proposed landfill solar project.   
 
The application process is different depending on the scale of the project being proposed.  For 
each of the rooftop projects, a local contractor submitted preliminary design drawings, single line 
electrical diagrams, proposed hardware specifications, as well as building specific details related 
to the meter numbers and the meter locations.  We worked with Farmers Branch staff including 
Katy Evans, Sustainability Manager, and Kevin Muenchow, Fleet and Facilities Director, to identify 
building specific and electricity meter details, in addition to getting Kevin’s sign-off for Oncor to 
proceed with the interconnection studies.  While we forecasted that each of the rooftop 
interconnection applications would result in a material cost for each, we were pleasantly 
surprised that Oncor ultimately performed each of the studies at no expense to the City.  Each 
rooftop interconnection application currently stands in a “Interconnection Agreement Sent for 
Signature” Stage in the diagram below.     
 
 
 
Per Oncor’s guidance: “This step initiates the completion of processing of (the) project by Oncor.  
An email notification will be sent when the designated installer sends out the interconnection 
agreement for signature.  Oncor works with end-use customer and their designated installer to 
complete the Interconnection Agreement and issue a Permission to Operate (PTO) letter.  Oncor 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
14 
initiates meter and account changes so that the chosen Retailer will have the billing information 
necessary for the installed system.  The designated Installer must sign the Interconnection 
Agreement and End-Use Customer must sign the Customer Affirmation Schedule designating your 
Installer as a party to the Interconnection Agreement.  Please reference the Oncor Interconnection 
Guide at www.oncor.com/dg. Please be advised that not all Retailers offer buy-back plans or 
credits for excess energy sent to the grid, and as the end-use customer it is up to you which Retailer 
you choose.” 
 
The interconnection process for the landfill is similar, albeit with a substantially longer time 
required for the study, as well as a more in-depth level of engineering required given the 
materially larger scale of the project relative to the proposed rooftop projects.  We 
collaborated with a M+W Group, a national EPC firm with Gigawatts of solar engineering and 
construction work experience, to prepare the engineering and initial project site layout for the 
proposed landfill project. Once the engineering was completed, the documentation was 
submitted and the City directly paid Oncor the $4,275.35 cost of the study from the Feasibility 
Study budget.  There were three elective items for the study, expected in-service date, GPS 
coordinates for the Point of Interconnection, and a meter selection based on how frequently 
the meters coordinate with the market.  To that end, we proposed that the expected in-service 
date of the proposed landfill solar project would be September 30th, 2020.  This date was 
projected for the purposes of the interconnection study, but does not require that the project 
be placed in service by this date. If however the project moves forward after a three month 
period post the receipt of the interconnection study, February 28th, 2020, then the project will 
be required to resubmit for a second interconnection study to determine nothing has changed 
in the interim with respect to the project’s ability to interconnect via Oncor. 
 
Based on guidance from Oncor with respect to the most cost-effective location for the 
proposed Point of Interconnection, we picked the southwestern-most electrical pole on the 
site.  This location was further informed by a discussion with Shane Davis, Director of 
Sustainability and Public Health for the City of Farmers Branch, regarding the location of the 
existing landfill gas passive venting infrastructure on the capped landfill. 
 
 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
15 
The results of the Oncor Interconnection Impact Study for the landfill were formally received 
February 28th, 2020 and have come back extremely favorable, from a cost standpoint, for a 
project of this scale.  The cost to interconnect the project per Oncor is $274,859.20.  From 
Oncor: “Completed Impact Studies are valid for three months. If after three months there is not 
a decision to proceed, then the Impact Study will expire. If the customer elects to proceed past 
this initial three- month period, then the project will be re-evaluated based on any policies, 
standards or codes that have changed since the previous Impact Study was completed. The 
project will also be subject to a new Impact Study fee.  
If within these three months another project is proposed on the same feeder or substation by 
another developer, then Oncor will approach the existing customer to complete their project. 
Preparation of the contract cost could take up to six weeks. After the final contract price is 
submitted to the customer, funding will be required within two weeks. If funding is not secured, 
then the existing Impact Study will expire.”   
TCEQ 
Given the fact that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has oversight to any 
proposed work for on former landfill sites, we were obliged to determine early on what 
requirements would need to be satisfied in order to build on the capped landfill.  
 
Landfill work falls under Subchapter T: Permitting Standards for Owners and Operators of 
Commercial Industrial Nonhazardous Waste Landfill Facilities.  Because solar is built on capped 
landfills across the country regularly now, this is becoming a more common use case for 
otherwise unbuildable land.  However, historically low power prices in Texas have resulted in a 
far fewer landfill solar projects in the state to date.  This may be changing, as per our 
conversation with Gayatri Bitracanti, an Environmental Permit Specialist in TCEQ’s Municipal 
Solid Waste Division.  She stated that there are 2-3 other potential landfill solar projects 
currently being evaluated at this time in Texas, one being near the City of Houston which is 
discussed in more detail below.   
 
From a process standpoint, for any kind of proposed surface disturbance to a capped landfill, 
TCEQ Form 20787: Authorization to Disturb Final Cover Over Closed Municipal Solid Waste 
Landfill for Non-Enclosed Structure (included in the supplemental information) and all of the 
corresponding attachments must be submitted for review to TCEQ.7  This focuses on a work 
plan authorization request, a Deed’s recordation confirming the site is a landfill, and drawings 
signed, sealed, and submitted by a Professional Engineer.  Initial conversations with Chuck 
Marsh at Weaver Consultants Group suggest a budget of $15,000-20,000 for this work. These 
documents need to be submitted to TCEQ and then they have 30 days to approve of the

City of Farmers Branch 
Permitting within the City would follow standard City building permit processes, although, per 
City officials, some consideration would be given to waiving permitting fees for each of the 
projects as the projects would be for the explicit benefit of the City itself. 
Analysis of regulations and allowable options within those rules  
The primary influencing regulation for the proposed projects is whether the project is “in front 
of the meter” or “behind the meter.”  This dictates how the electricity is perceived by the grid, 
and ultimately how it influences the value of the electricity.  As described in the section on 
potential rates above, the value of solar on a building’s rooftop is greater in a relative sense 
than the value of solar located off premises.  This is due to the ability of a rooftop project to 
offset some of the TDSP charges, where an “in front of the meter” project cannot offset the 
TDSP charges.  This has an influence on the economics of the project, but not on the ability of 
any of the projects to move forward.  
 
To operate in Oncor territory, the “in front of the meter” proposed landfill project will require a 
Qualified Scheduling Entity8 (QSE) due to its proposed project size. This will allow it to interface 
with the electrical grid in order to be able to supply power to the grid in an orderly fashion once 
operational.  This QSE serves to interface with the Load Serving Entity, which can also double as 
the Retail Electricity Provider.  The QSE role can come at an additional cost to the PPA rate, 
given that the QSE is a different entity than the actual landfill solar project.  However, from our 
discussions with MP2, a Retail Electricity Provider in the Texas market, it is possible to have the 
QSE role built into a long term electricity procurement contract that the City would sign with a 
Retail Electricity Provider, assuming the City had also signed a PPA with the landfill solar project 
to procure the electricity to offset against all of the City’s electricity demands (e.g. buildings, 
street lights, and any other use cases the city has).  This is one of the most important aspects in 
negotiating the city’s next power contract in the event the city elects to move forward with a 
PPA for the proposed the landfill solar project.  Said more simply, the landfill project will have 
additional third parties involved to manage the operation of the solar plant, but depending on 
the City’s next Retail Electricity Provider, that entity could provide economic advantages by 
simultaneously performing those roles in addition to their Retail Electricity Provider role. 
 
As noted in the above permitting section, TCEQ does have regulatory oversight on the closed 
landfill.  However, the regulatory requirements are fairly straightforward for building a non-
enclosed structure on a closed landfill, provided that the disturbance to the landfill cap is 
minimal and the engineering plan is well documented.  This engineering plan would be a 
component of any engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the landfill 
solar project and would not inhibit the project from moving forward.  This landfill solar project 
would be the 2nd or 3rd landfill solar project in the state that TCEQ would be evaluating.  At this 
moment, there is a similar, albeit larger, 75MW solar project being proposed for a landfill near

Analysis of project taxation: 1) sales tax, 2) personal property tax, 3) real 
property tax  
 
In the most general terms, analysis of the forecasted operating expenses of a solar project 
include an analysis of three different types of taxation a solar project may face; (1) personal 
property tax, (2) real property tax, and (3) sales tax.  
 
The applicable of each of the foregoing taxes varies significantly on a state by state and town by 
town basis.   
 
Personal Property Tax 
In general terms, personal property tax addresses the taxation applicable to the solar 
equipment in the field at a particular location. It some states, solar is exempt from personal 
property tax.  In others it is calculated in a manner similar to other equipment: by assessing the 
value of the equipment, agreeing upon a depreciation schedule, and determining the annual 
tax burden by utilizing an industrial or commercial mill rate in the town.  In instances in which 
personal property tax is applicable, solar system developers and towns frequently negotiate 
“PILOT” agreements, or “payment in lieu of taxes” agreements that pre-agree to the personal 
property taxation of a solar project over an extended period of time to offer certainty to both 
sides.  
 
Real Property Tax 
Conversely, real property tax considers only the real estate or real property of a particular 
location, without consideration of the equipment that is onsite.  Generally, this is calculated by 
determining the assessed value of the real estate and applying a town mill rate to it.  
 
Sales Tax 
Finally, sales tax can be applicable to the sales of electricity generated by the solar facility.  In 
most states, solar facilities are exempt from sales tax, but this must be considered on a case by 
case basis as a structure is determined and a power sale arrangement is finalized.  
 
For purposes of our analysis herein and based on a conversation with Farmers Branch Mayor 
Robert Dye, we have assumed that the solar facilities are exempt from each of the foregoing 
three taxes.  Additionally, GAP has confirmed that Cities in Texas are exempt from personal, 
property and sales taxes.

Procurement summary and initial turnkey cost estimates based on the 
site-specific projects 
 
For each opportunity, we requested a line item breakout of the currently forecasted 
construction costs.  These costs can vary significantly as commodity and equipment prices 
fluctuate, and also by virtue of conducting an RFP or competitive bidding process.  However, for 
purposes of this feasibility study, it was important to set a baseline for cost estimates to 
perform the necessary analysis set forth in this report.  
 
Below is a matrix summarizing the estimated construction costs for each of the locations: 
 
Location 
 
DC System Size 
Cost per DC Watt 
Total Cost 
City Hall 
83.6 KWdc 
$2.08 
$174,387 
Rec Center 
270 KWdc 
$2.02 
$545,905 
Natatorium 
60.8 KWdc 
$2.08 
$132,021 
Manske Library 
218 KWdc 
$2.09 
$455,728 
Fire Station 
69.2 kWdc 
$2.16 
$150,000 
Landfill 
4,582 kWdc 
$1.48 
$6,784,457 
 
The costs set forth in the table above are numbers that we believe reflect conservative 
forecasts that can be significantly improved upon by enhanced cost-benefit analysis and 
competitive bidding. Additionally, each site was priced without any reliance on any additional 
site or sites being completed, meaning there were no efficiencies or economies of scale 
considered in the pricing. The impact of COVID-19 on the economy has also brought about 
significant upheaval in the labor market and equipment markets, such that EPC firms are very 
strongly motivated to build projects at the moment and are able to do so at lower costs.  This 
provides leverage for negotiation with respect to pricing. 
 
In particular, the rooftop systems carry equipment costs that can be materially reduced by the 
economies of scale the landfill would offer.  
 
We also want to make clear that these costs exclude any transactional costs, soft costs or 
interconnection costs imposed by Oncor, and reflect the turnkey construction costs of the solar 
facility itself that the City can expect to have within the scope of a standard turnkey EPC 
contract.

budgets for the rooftop projects are included in the supplemental information supporting this 
report. 
Analysis of Available Transaction Structures – PPA, ownership, hybrid 
As the City reviews the opportunity to build solar facilities on city building rooftops and/or the 
capped landfill, there are options to consider with respect to the ownership structure and 
corresponding asset management responsibilities for the projects.   
 
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) 
The first type of arrangement is a Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”) previously referenced in 
sections above.  A PPA is a contract that an electricity user can enter into to buy power from a 
solar project.  The contract generally stipulates one of two pricing structures:  a fixed price that 
may escalate at a fixed percentage over time or a fixed discount to a floating price usually 
correlating to an agreed upon index that the utility utilizes to determine the general electricity 
rates applicable to the PPA Buyer.  Whether the environmental attributes, such as carbon 
credits, renewable energy certificates and other “green” commodities are included in a PPA is a 
point negotiated by the PPA buyer and seller.  
 
A PPA may have other terms and conditions relating to guaranteed production, operations and 
maintenance, and similar provisions that are generally applicable to the underlying project for 
supply contracts in other asset classes.  This “third party ownership” model, is the predominant 
model in market because it allows the City an opportunity to receive some level of guaranteed 
electricity savings without having any upfront capital outlay or ongoing operational obligations 
with respect to the underlying solar facility.  In other terms, it allows the City to participate in 
economic benefits of a solar project without having to assume its burdens.  The savings 
generated by purchasing lower cost power from the project relative to the electrical grid is the 
motivation for moving forward with a PPA.  Given the City’s municipal status, and the fact that 
it doesn’t pay federal taxes for the core of its operations, third party ownership for these 
projects would enable them to monetize solar investment tax credits, worth roughly 26% of the 
tax basis of the project through the end of 202010, as a mechanism to improve the economics of 
the projects.   
 
City Ownership 
The second type of arrangement is where the solar projects are City owned, and the City 
assumes the cost to build the projects, after which the City oversees the long-term operation 
and maintenance (O&M) of the projects.  This type of arrangement generally necessitates an 
ongoing O&M and/or asset management agreement and similar arrangements to ensure that 
the solar project is fully operational year over year.  The performance of the solar facility, and 
                                                 
10 The solar investment tax credit is worth 26% of the tax basis of a solar project for projects that begin 
construction or spend more than 5% of their cost on project related expenses before the end of 2020.  If 
neither of these elements are achieved, the solar investment tax credit drops to 22% of the tax basis of 
the solar project for projects that begin construction in 2021, and 10% thereafter under current 
legislation. 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
20 
how well it is managed day-by-day, will dictate the ultimate return the City recoups on its 
upfront investment. The primary differences between this arrangement and that of the PPA is 
that the City assumes the complete burden and benefit, both upfront and over time, with 
respect to the solar facility.   Additionally, given that the City has municipal status and doesn’t 
pay federal income taxes, the City would not be eligible to monetize the tax credits under this 
ownership structure.   
 
Hybrid  
The third option is a hybrid of the first two options.  It is a PPA with an early buyout clause that 
allows the City to purchase the asset at a fair market value after the IRS recapture period 
associated with the tax credits passes.  Said differently, this hybrid model allows for third party 
ownership and therefore third party financing of the projects, with provisions in the contract 
that allow the City to purchase the projects from the third party PPA provider at some pre-
determined time after the projects have been operational, usually for more than 5 years. This 
allows for the monetization of the federal tax credits, but still provides meaningful savings to 
the City during both the initial term of the PPA and afterwards, assuming the City elects to 
exercise the fair market value early buyout clause.  Should the City not elect to exercise the fair 
market early buyout clause, the PPA would resemble the first PPA option described above 
where the third party PPA provider would continue to operate and maintain the project and the 
City would continue to purchase the electricity generated by the project.  
 
Recommendations 
Based on the entirety of the information in this feasibility study, it is our initial recommendation 
that the City pursue self-ownership (Option 2) with respect to the proposed rooftop projects 
given the scale of those projects doesn’t lend themselves to third party ownership. The project 
cash flows in a proposed PPA are likely insufficient to cover additional expenses required by a 
third party owner.  Self-ownership of the proposed rooftop projects would, however, create 
meaningful electricity expense savings to the City over the 30-year life of the rooftop projects. 
 
Secondarily, it is our recommendation that if the City would like to proceed with the proposed 
landfill project, the most economically advantageous manner would be for the City pursue a 
PPA with the proposed landfill project (Option 1 or 3, as described above) given that the capital 
expenses associated with a 5.12MWdc project are substantially larger than those of the 
proposed rooftop projects, the operational burdens are much more significant, and the value of 
monetizing the federal investment tax credits is also increased given the scale of the project.  
Should the City desire to own the asset in the future, a PPA with an early buyout clause would 
allow for that optionality whilst simultaneously allowing for the monetization of the tax credits. 
Analysis of Available Power Sale Contracts 
As of the date of this study and based upon the feasibility work completed to date, it is unlikely 
the City will be able to sell power from these proposed solar projects to another user.   This is 
particularly the case for the rooftop projects, where the power generated from those projects 
would literally flow directly into the building on which the project is located to help offset and 
reduce electrical demand the grid sees from the building.  There is the possibility of having 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
21 
multiple electricity offtakers for the landfill project, should the City elect not to purchase the 
entirety of the electricity output from the project, although the likelihood of that remains small.  
Thus, the power sale contracts that would be options for the City would be in line with the 
three options (PPA, City ownership, or PPA with an early buyout clause) referenced in the 
section immediately above.  This is something that could be explored further in the event the 
projects proceed into a development phase.  
 
For the avoidance of any doubt, GAP is the City consultant with respect to assisting the City 
with their next long-term electricity contract.   
Analysis of Available Subsidies – ONCOR small scale projects and federal 
tax credits 
There are two available subsidies available for consideration for the proposed solar projects.   
 
Oncor Solar Photovoltaic Standard Offer Program 
The first is Oncor’s Solar Photovoltaic Standard Offer Program, which is geared explicitly for 
rooftop solar installations, less than 200kWac in size, that do not provide more than 75% of the 
maximum electrical demand for the building.11  Additionally, the program is open to a shortlist 
of qualified installers, of which Native Solar is one.  Each of the proposed rooftop projects were 
designed explicitly with this in mind.  The program generously offers up to $0.50/Watt of a 
grant subsidy, paid directly to the installer of the project, until the funds associated with the 
program are used up.  The budget for the program in 2020 is roughly $2.2M and is fully 
allocated across projects that have submitted their applications thus far through 3/26/20.   
 
Submissions were made to the program on behalf of each of the rooftop projects, including the 
City Hall, Manske Library, Margaret Young Natatorium, Farmers Branch Recreation Center, and 
the Children’s Health StarCenter.  It was during this submission process that a change in 
organization structure occurred at the StarCenter and the proposed solar project for that 
rooftop was put on hold.  Across the initial four projects, our submissions have secured a total 
allocation of $313,000 in Oncor funds divided across the projects based on the size of their 
proposed solar system.  Additionally, the proposed project for the new Fire Station on Alpha 
Road has also been submitted to the Oncor program and is currently on the wait list.  Projects 
that are granted an allocation but do not move forward eventually give up their allocation of 
funds, which are then used on wait list projects.       
 
Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit 
The second subsidy opportunity is the use of the federal solar investment tax credit and bonus 
depreciation benefits.12  A solar project that begins construction and is placed in service in 2020 
qualifies for a 26% federal tax credit.  This credit is based on the tax basis of the project, 
essentially the cost of the project inclusive of hardware costs, labor costs, financing costs, and 
                                                 
11 The full 2020 Oncor Solar Photovoltaic Standard Offer Program summary is provided in the 
supplemental information.  
12 https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-investment-tax-credit-itc 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
22 
reasonable developer margin.  In order to monetize this federal tax credit, the owner of the 
project must be an entity that pays federal income taxes.  Given the City’s municipal status, the 
City would not be able to monetize the solar investment tax credit in a City ownership model.   
 
Recommendations 
In order to monetize the investment tax credits for the City’s benefit, a federal tax-paying third 
party would be required to own the project(s) upon which the tax credit was to be taken.  There 
are non-negligible legal expenses incurred when monetizing investment tax credits, which 
generally require a project of a certain size and scale to make it worthwhile to do so.  At this 
point, it remains our recommendation that the City pursue a self-ownership model for the 
proposed rooftop projects, whereas pursuing the investment tax credit model via third party 
ownership for the proposed landfill project makes good economic sense.  Similarly, a project is 
eligible to accelerate its depreciation from a standard MACRS schedule13 to a much more 
accelerated “bonus” depreciation schedule.  This schedule is subject to various tax rules that 
are impact dependent on whether the underlying project also assumes recourse or non-
recourse debt that can get complicated and require exact inputs to calculate that are generally 
not available until a project is at a much more advanced stage.  The depreciation benefits can 
be further discussed upon request. 
Financial Analysis and Preliminary Modeling 
The financials of a solar project operate similarly to infrastructure investments in that they 
require a substantial upfront capital outlay in order to commission a hard asset that is 
forecasted to generate a return of, and on, that capital overlay over a prolonged period of time. 
The returns tend to be similar to infrastructure returns in that they are generally stable relative 
to other types of assets, but also tend to take a significant period of time for the investment to 
begin showing a positive return.  Therefore, the decision for the City is whether the significant 
cost that must be invested upfront is worth the benefit you hope to receive over time.  
 
It is also important to note that the actual costs and benefits of any solar project are difficult to 
predict until the project completes the development cycle.  The actual costs will be known once 
permits, interconnection studies and market conditions are known.  The benefits of solar 
project will not be known until design and engineering is complete, system sizes are confirmed, 
technology is selected and business deals (PPAs, taxes, real estate contracts, etc.) are finalized.  
Therefore, the numbers outlined below must be coupled with a statement that they are general 
estimates generated by a feasibility study but are subject to significant change should the City 
elect to proceed with the development of the solar projects.  It is not until the City would be in 
a position to commit to equipment providers and laborers (through an EPC) that the costs 
would be able to locked in to a certain margin of error.  
 
                                                 
13 The modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) is a depreciation system used for tax 
purposes in the U.S. MACRS depreciation allows the capitalized cost of an asset to be recovered over a 
specified period via annual deductions. The MACRS system puts fixed assets into classes that have set 
depreciation periods. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macrs.asp)

In terms of the capital outlay, the table below summarizes costs estimated to be expended in 
order to develop, design, build and interconnect each solar project.  The EPC Cost column sets 
forth a conservative turnkey cost to build the applicable project.  The Estimated Development, 
Soft and Transaction Costs column includes items like design, permitting, legal, environmental, 
etc. that will be expended in addition to the turnkey EPC cost to complete the installation 
process.  The Total Cost column sums the two aforementioned columns.  We note that any 
incentives from Oncor are excluded from these calculations.

Rooftop 
Once an estimate of costs is established, the investment analysis progresses to a determination 
of the benefit generated by the solar facility once it is installed.  With respect to the rooftop 
systems for which we have recommended the City pursue self-ownership, this benefit is primarily 
derived from arbitraging the now presumably free electricity against the rate the City otherwise 
would have paid.  This analysis is included in the supplemental materials to this report as outlined 
in the Native Solar rooftop project specific summaries.   We note that this positive savings 
arbitrage must be netted against the operating expenses the City will incur to ensure the solar 
project is fully functional.  As we mentioned previously in this report, the City will enjoy the full 
benefits and burdens of the solar facility under a self-ownership model.  Therefore, things like 
operations and maintenance expense, insurance, and other operating expenses must be 
considered in arriving at the net benefit to the City.  
 
Landfill 
In terms of the landfill, we note that we have suggested the City pursue a third-party ownership 
model.  Under this model the city will not incur any upfront capital outlay and therefore it begins 
profitable participation in the solar economics of the landfill as soon as it is installed.  The roughly 
 
City of Farmers Branch Solar Feasibility Study 
24 
$7.5M cost outlined in the table above will be assumed by a third party and the City will benefit 
primarily through arbitraging its current electric rate against the rate in the PPA it negotiates with 
the owner of the landfill.   
 
With the current design we have considered in this report, the landfill is expected to generate 
7,291,000 kWh in its first year of operation.  Assuming that base case generation, the City will 
benefit $72,910 for each $.01/kWh it purchases power under the PPA relative to its other 
electricity purchase obligations.  For example, if the City is generally purchasing power at 
$.0927/kWh (excluding the TDSP charges for street lighting), and it purchases power from the 
landfill at $.083 under a PPA, it would derive a Y1 benefit in the amount of $70,722.7.
