ADJOURN 
Agenda Item No. 4 
Issue:  Preliminary and Final Plat Review – Primewest First Addition 
______________________________________________________________________________ 
BACKGROUND 
This request has been submitted by James Miller and Mick Family Properties, LLC.  The request 
is for preliminary and final plat review of Primewest First Addition, in which Miller would be 
selling an approximately 11.3 acre parcel to Mick Family Properties, LLC, and by which the Miller 
property would be combined with two existing Mick parcels (one of which is vacant) to form a 
single larger parcel.  This would be a single-lot, single-block configuration.  The fact that the 
Miller property is unplatted, necessity to ensure frontage of parcel on public street, and general 
proposed configuration of the property drives the need to plat the property.   Staff has not received 
any information on potential development of the property but once platted the property would 
available for further development as part of the Mick property.  Depending on development 
proposal the property could be administratively subdivided in the future if needed.   
The configuration of the property meets all standards of the applicable I-1, Light Industrial District 
in which it is located.  Portions of the Miller property further to the west are zoned differently but 
there is no need for rezoning with this request.  City utilities are available to the property via Julep 
Road.   
As the Miller portion of the property has not been previously platted, payment-in-lieu of parkland 
dedication is required. Staff will be preparing a memo and recommendation to the Park Board for 
their review and recommendation to the City Council.  Based on the ordinance requirement of 5% 
of land value for industrial properties, and extrapolating the value of the 11.3 acre parcel to be 
platted via the Stearns County Assessor’s Office, the recommended payment to the City would be 
$24,261.00.    Staff would note that the City does not establish who is responsible for payment of 
the required fee and that is left up to the applicants to decide between themselves as they see fit, 
but that we do require that the fee be paid prior to City signatures being affixed to the plats for 
recording purposes.   
Staff is supportive of the preliminary and final plats as-submitted.  Any comments received ahead 
of the closing of public comment period will be noted by staff at time of Planning Commission 
meeting, but as of 6/4/2020 no comments or concerns have been received by staff.

2. Denial of the preliminary plat, with findings of fact.

recommendation to the City Council.  An extension of the 60-day request review period as 
noted by State Statutes may be required.   
 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION 
Staff recommends approval of the preliminary plat with the following conditions: 
1. Development upon the property may be subject to a Development Agreement with the City, 
if deemed necessary.   
2. Property is subject to requirement for payment-in-lieu of Parkland Dedication, as 
recommended by Park Board and established by City Council.  Any required parkland 
dedication fees must be paid prior to affixing of City signatures upon the plat.   
Provided that conditions of the preliminary plat are satisfied, staff recommends approval of the 
final plat.
