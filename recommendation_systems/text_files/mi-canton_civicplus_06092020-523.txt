             COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
PRESENTER:   Patrick Williams, Supervisor 
 
INDIVIDUALS IN ATTENDANCE:   None anticipated 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:     The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating to many local 
businesses in Canton Township. In support of these businesses and allow them to take measures to 
recover from the last 3 months of reduced productivity and service it is imperative that the Township 
take action to assist where we can. The establishment of the Canton Business Support Provision will 
allow for eased restrictions on outdoor dining and sidewalk sales where appropriate. This provision 
will allow for an easy application and approval process to allow outdoor dining and sidewalk sales 
from June 10, 2020 through October 31, 2020.   
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic Governor 
Whitmer closed all restaurants and retail establishments on March 13th followed by the stay at 
home order on March 23rd. As of June 1st the stay at home order has been lifted and retailers and 
restaurants can operate at a reduced capacity starting June 8th. The closure has adversely affected 
businesses throughout the region, state and country and all are looking for alternatives to get back 
to business as quickly as possible, while adhering the social distancing standards set by the CDC.  
 
STRATEGIC PLAN/GOALS:  To support the economic development and retention of all Canton 
businesses.   
 
 
ACTION REQUESTED:  Consider approval of the Canton Business Support Provision with 
administrative approval with no fees from June 10, 2020 – October 31, 2020.

REQUEST FOR BOARACTION 
 
 
MEETING DATE:  June 9, 2020 
AGENDA ITEM #G-2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRESENTER:   Patrick Williams 
 
INDIVIDUALS IN ATTENDANCE: 
None anticipated. 
 
BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020 during the tour of the facility, the Partnership for the 
Arts (PFA) made three formal requests to the Township: 
 
a. 
A request to complete a parking lot on the 1-acre parcel that the Township owns; 
 
b. 
A request that the Township provide reimbursement for a portion of the existing 
 
 
 
storm water pond that would service the future parking lot; and  
 
c. 
A request that the Township provide a portion of the costs for the western entrance 
 
 
to the Village Arts Factory (VAF). 
The Township’s Engineer, Bill Serchak, has received documentation from the general contractor 
and has analyzed what was submitted. With the information that was received the following are 
comments for the three areas that are being requested for township funding. 
PARKING LOT 
Currently, the PFA has two operating buildings (the Western Building – the “Warehouse”, and 
the Dormitory or “Creamery”), and they have access to their parking lot (46 spaces) and the 
public parking lot on the north side of Cherry Hill Road, near West Road (39 spaces) for a total 
of 85 spaces.   We anticipate that an additional 40 to 50 spaces could be provided on the 1-acre 
parcel. 
Currently, the Township has budgeted $300,000 for construction of a parking lot.  Although 
these funds have been budgeted over the past few years, the Township has not determined the 
need for this parking lot or approved design or construction of this project.     
It is unclear what the current or future parking needs are for the entire facility, as the parking 
calculations used in the original site plan do not correlate with the current use of the two 
occupied building(s).  In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has the township analyzing the 
budget projections and may have to reconsider paving the parking lot all together. 
 
STORMWATER POND 
The storm water pond constructed at the VAF drains a total area of 3.78 acres and the design 
includes future drainage from the 1-acre township parcel.  Based on this information, the 
percentage of the pond used by the Township parcel is 1 / 3.78 = 26.4%.  
General costs for the pond construction (see attachment).  Based on a review of these costs, the 
pond excavation cost is $213,383.00.  A 26.4% pro-rata share of the costs to excavate the pond 
is $56,333. 
 
WESTERN DRIVEWAY APPROACH 
The VAF contractor provided a cost of $172,477.00 for the western driveway approach on 
Cherry Hill Road.  The request from PFA is for Canton Township to reimburse 50% of this 
amount, $86,238.50. The Township is recommending that the 26.4% pro-rata share be used in 
this instance which equates to $45,534.  
 
SUMMARY 
The above information has been provided in order for you to consider the request of PFA after 
review of the Township’s engineering department. I have included total exposure/expenses that 
are either being requested by PFA, included in the Township’s CIP or additional costs needed 
to complete a portion of the overall project.

ITEM:  Consider Approval of a Budget Amendment & Award of a Purchase Order Contract 
with the Mannik & Smith Group for Additional Engineering Services for the 
Historic Ford Factory Pathway Project 
 
 
 
PRESENTER:   Jade Smith, Municipal Services Director 
 
INDIVIDUALS IN ATTENDANCE:   None Anticipated  
 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:   In 2015 the Township agreed fund the design and construction of 
a path and pedestrian bridge on Cherry Hill Road, west of Ridge along the frontage of the future 
Village Arts Factory.  The funding for this project included a Transportation Alternatives Program 
(TAP) grant that was applied for by the Township jointly with Wayne County.   This TAP grant 
was approved by MDOT and SEMCOG for approximately $262,700 in 2017.   At that time, the 
Township entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with Wayne County, who is the 
receiver of the grant funds, which they pass along to the Township.  Under the IGA, all additional 
funding must be provided by the Township.   
 
The project was bid by MDOT in spring 2018, however, when the bids were reviewed by MDOT, 
the pricing was significantly higher than anticipated.  At the time, the Township considered 
rejecting the grant, however, the final decision was to re-design the bridge to attempt to achieve 
some cost savings.  The Township approved our designer of record, The Mannik & Smith Group 
(MSG) to move forward with a re-design.  This resulted in a reduction in the construction costs of 
the project to approximately $73,873, and the project was ultimately awarded LJ Construction, 
Inc. by MDOT.  The bridge has been installed, and the project is now nearing completion.  Due to 
the significant effort to review alternatives and re-design the bridge along with an extended time 
period to complete the construction, Engineering Services recommends approval of a change to 
the contract with MSG. 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The Village Arts Factory pathway project was initiated in 
2015 and includes design and construction of a 700’ long asphalt pathway and pedestrian bridge 
over the Rouge River along Cherry Hill Road, west of Ridge Road along the south side of the 
roadway.  The designer for the project, MSG was retained by Canton Township and the project 
was bid in Spring 2018.  At that time, in anticipation of construction, the Township awarded 
construction engineering services to MSG in the amount of $42,649.   
 
As noted above, after the bids were higher than expected, the Township requested that MSG 
conduct an alternatives analysis and ultimately commissioned a re-design of the bridge to save 
construction costs.   Due to the additional alternatives analysis, re-design of the bridge, along with 
a longer than anticipated construction period due to utility re-location and coordination with the 
private contractor on-site, MSG has prepared a change order in the amount of $48,000  for this 
project.  A budget amendment is also necessary as these funds were not budgeted in 2019.   A 
timeline of the project and details are provided in Attachment 1.   The change order from MSG is 
provided as Attachment 2. 
 
STRATEGIC PLAN/GOALS:    The Township has a desire to fill sidewalk gaps and pathways 
each year to provide a safe and connected pedestrian system including connection to existing trails 
in the community.  
 
 
ACTION REQUESTED: 
Approve a purchase order contract with the Mannik & Smith Group 
for additional design and construction engineering of the Historic Ford Factory Pathway in the 
amount of $48,000.  Also approve the budget amendment necessary to fund these expenses. 
 
 
BUDGET IMPLICATIONS & ACCOUNT NUMBER:   The funds for this project will require 
a budget amendment the community improvement fund. The following budget amendment is 
necessary to fund these expenses as depicted below. 
 
Increase Expense: 
 #246-441.970_0050 Community Improvement – Capital Outlay Infrastructure    $48,000 
Increase Revenue: 
 #246-000.695 Fund Balance Appropriation                                                            $48,000 
 
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:   Upon approval, Engineering Services will issue a purchase order 
for this work to Mannik & Smith Group under their existing Master Services Agreement. 
 
DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION:   Approval 
 
FINANCE AND BUDGET DIRECTOR’S RECOMMENDATION:  Approval 
 
SUPERVISOR'S RECOMMENDATION:  Approval 
 
MODEL RESOLUTION:    1) Further, I move to approve a budget amendment to fund the 
design and construction engineering expenses as follows: 
 
Increase Expense: 
#246-441.970_0050 Community Improvement – Capital Outlay Infrastructure    $48,000 
 
Increase Revenue:

      AGENDA ITEM # G-4  
ITEM:  Consider Approval of Two (2) Purchase Orders to Develop the Tyler ERP-to Cityworks 
              Integration 
PRESENTER:   Jade Smith, Municipal Services Director/Wendy Trumbull, Finance Director 
INDIVIDUALS IN ATTENDANCE:   None anticipated 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:     Canton Public Works is requesting permission to update the 
Cityworks software application functionality as part of the Cityworks Strategic Implementation Plan. 
The upgraded functionality will increase the functionality and productivity for the Township staff in 
various departments.  Public Works is requesting approval of the two purchase orders to move 
forward with the Tyler ERP-to-Cityworks Integration project, at a cost not-to-exceed $52,243 for 
implementation services.  
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Canton Public Works processes are not fully paperless 
which allows for errors and inefficiencies.  The Public Works staff cannot complete all their 
work in the field with the current technology.  The manual processes are impacting Canton 
Public Works, the Water Billing Department, and the citizens of the Township.  Currently the 
staff have a manual component within the process structure.  To streamline this process and 
provide for a more productive and efficient environment, the two applications, Cityworks and 
Tyler, must have the ability to communicate back and forth.   An upgrade is needed for both 
applications to create the current environment to allow this communication.  This upgrade to the 
software is in line with current technology.  The software will be hosted in a cloud base 
environment which will allow for more efficient, secure, and timely processes.   
The Township currently has licenses for Tyler and Cityworks. Three (3) possible vendors were 
analyzed for cost and value to perform the upgrades to the software and applications. In the end 
the MSD Director along with the Finance and Budget Director and IT Applications Delivery 
Manager agreed that the lowest cost option would be to stay with the current vendors and procure 
the assistance of Power Engineering.  The purchase requested will allow the Township to 
upgrade its licensing to allow for a two-way communication between the two software 
applications while hosting the applications in a cloud environment.  
STRATEGIC PLAN/GOALS:  The implementation of the Tyler ERP integration will result in 
productivity gains by eliminating redundant data entry between the Tyler ERP and Cityworks 
applications by auto-generating Work Orders in the Cityworks system from request for service 
entered by Water Billing, and facilitate better communication between the Water Billing and 
Customer Service departments.   
ACTION REQUESTED:  Consider authorizing a purchase order for implementation services for 
the Service Request Management Project to Power Engineers in the amount of $33,507. 
Additionally authorizing a separate Purchase order to Tyler Technologies in the amount of $18,736 
for the Application Program Interface (API) purchase. 
BUDGET IMPLICATIONS & ACCOUNT NUMBER: 
Funds are available from the following accounts listed below: 
Capital Outlay Computers & Equipment (592-536.970_0010) 
 
 
          $26,121.50 
Capital Outlay Computers & Equipment (592-537.970_0010) 
 
 
         $26,121.50 
 
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:  Upon Approval, Public Works will enter a Purchase order in the 
amount of $33,507 to Power Engineers for implementation services and a Separate Purchase order in 
the amount of $18,736 to Tyler Technologies to purchase needed API.  Public Works will coordinate 
with IT to complete the implementation.   
 
  
DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION:   Approval 
 
FINANCE AND BUDGET DIRECTOR’S RECOMMENDATION:   Approval 
 
SUPERVISOR'S RECOMMENDATION:  Approval 
 
MODEL RESOLUTION:     
 
1. I move to approve a Purchase Order and Award professional services to Power Engineers, 
Inc, for the implementation services in the amount of $33,507.  I also move to approve a 
Second Purchase order for the Purchase of Applications Program Interface API from 
Tyler Technologies in the amount of $18,736.

ITEM:  Consider Approving the Annual Payment of Western Wayne County Mutual Aid 
              Association Dues 
 
 
PRESENTER:  Christopher Stoecklein, Deputy Director of Fire 
 
INDIVIDUALS IN ATTENDANCE:    None anticipated    
 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:   The Canton Fire Department is a member of the Western Wayne 
County Fire Department Mutual Aid Association, a consortium of approximately 20 departments 
throughout Western-Wayne, Washtenaw and Oakland counties.  This association is run under the 
Inter-Local Agreement in conjunction with the Urban Cooperation Act of 1976, and allows 
departments to provide reciprocal services to each other when requested.  Canton’s 2020 dues are 
$17,427.68, and include: 
 
• $  3,000.00 – Association Dues Base Annual Amount 
• $14,427.68 – Western Wayne Association Dues per capita, based on 2010 census 
 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:   HEMS (Health Emergency Medical Services, Inc.) is a 
contractor for the State of Michigan and represents the Department of Health in Western Wayne 
County.  HEMS acts as a medical control for all ambulance services in Western Wayne County.  
HEMS establishes medical protocol and coordinates communications between the transporting 
agencies and hospitals.  In 2000, the Mutual Aid Association became financially active with 
HEMS securing one seat on the Board of Directors.  This has proven to be a beneficial 
relationship for both HEMS and community fire departments in the association.   
 
HIRT (Hazardous Incident Response Team) responds to major hazardous material incidents.   
USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) responds to “technical” rescues such as trench cave-ins or 
high angle rescues.  Because it is not economically feasible for individual department’s to

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:   The Police and Fire Department’s current 800 MHz mobile and 
portable radio warranty expires in June.  The department is requesting to purchase a one-year 
Motorola extended warranty for 226 police and fire department radios in the amount of 
$18,851.50, from ComSource, Inc., the local authorized Motorola service vendor in Michigan. 
 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  In 2012, the Public Safety Department purchased a 
comprehensive new 800 MHz radio system.  The original investment in 800 MHz mobile and 
portable radios was just over $1 million, and included a five-year warranty which has since 
expired.  Motorola continues to offer a one-year extended warranty through their local authorized 
repair vendor, ComSource, Inc..  The warranty includes on-site service, pick-up and delivery.  
Based on the replacement cost of these radios, service coverage is recommended. 
 
Motorola is a sole-source provider of their product, utilizing ComSource Inc., as their contracted 
local service vendor.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:    The Police Department is requesting to waive the bidding 
process due to sole-source manufacturer and purchase personal protection equipment for officers 
to be used during munitions training.  This request includes 100 helmets from the sole-source 
manufacturer Ultimate Training Munitions, in the amount of $13,728.  This request also includes 
the purchase of 100 groin protectors and 100 protective gloves from the lowest quoted vendor, 
Ultimate Training Munitions, in the amount of $8,200.       
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the police department’s 
staff identified considerable flaws regarding the use of personal protective equipment by officers 
participating in munitions training.  The current equipment is shared by all sworn officers and 
ample time to sanitize properly between uses does not exist.  Shared equipment includes face 
masks, neck protectors, gloves and groin protectors.  This equipment is often exposed to sweat, 
breath, saliva and sometimes blood.  The types of training this equipment is used for is critical to 
the on-going development of our officers and therefore, we are proposing the purchase of 
individual pieces of equipment for each officer.   
 
The department has tested various models of munition PPE including those made by Simunition 
and Ultimate Training Munitions (UTM), and is recommending the UTM P/N 69-Helmet.  This 
sole-source helmet provides 180° visibility, ventilation ports to aid in anti-fogging, a sweatband 
and neck wrap, the ability to be worn with prescription eyewear, clear facial recognition and a 
flip-up option for debriefing.   The UTM P/N 69-Helmet is $171.60, but if ordered by July 17, 
2020, a 20% discount is offered bringing the total to $137.28 per helmet. 
 
Per the Township’s Purchasing Policy, the department also received three informal quotes for 
standard groin protectors and gloves, with UTM quoting the lowest price for these items:
