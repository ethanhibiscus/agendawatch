2. RIC Report (Steve Tait) 
Tait’s report is online. The COVID-19 response continues to consume almost everybody’s day. 
Tait commended the Central Region for holding weekly calls with the PSAPs to discuss 
operational issues and report back any technical issues to the state EOC. A lot of discussion on 
the Rapid Deploy project and the effectiveness of Executive Order 20-34, which is the order to 
provide information on COVID-positive addresses to our PSAPs. There will be some additional 
communication coming out from Director Wahlberg on where we are at with 20-34 and some of 
the frustrations we are experiencing in getting collaboration and cooperation from the MN 
Department of Health. We have a lot of activity on grants occurring this week with the Grants 
Workgroup call yesterday. The MN Land Mobile Radio Conventional Interop Plan, MnDOT 
will be doing some site work on all those VHF tower sites. Central Region is scheduled to have 
their work done between June 29 and July 10th. Jim Stromberg will be communicating with the 
region on what that means as far as training and operations for the PSAPs. There is a planning 
meeting next week for the PSAP COOP exercise that Cathy Anderson is bringing in on 
September 17th. The planning meeting is at 8:30 on the 13th.

Reports: (Continued) 
SRB/ARMER Update; MnDPS/MnDOT: (Continued) 
3. SECB: (Micah Myers) 
CentraCare participation plan, which was approved in the Central at the O&O, was approved. 
Hennepin County request to Asset Management was approved. Motorola inter-zone patching 
concern was discussed. Lahr added that inter-zone patching was approved by LMR Committee 
and approved to submit to Motorola to include in the next available system software release, that 
was approved at SECB as well. Myers stated Mayo Clinic Ambulance dispatch console addition 
was approved. The establishment of the SECB and it looks like it will be also the SHSP Grant 
hierarchy was approved by the board.  
 
4. Land Mobile Radio Committee: (Kristen Lahr) 
Motorola inter-zone patching, the solution provided by Motorola was approved at LMR and 
moved to SECB and approved there as well. Hopefully, we will be seeing that option available 
to us in a coming system release. CentraCare also had a statewide site access roaming talkgroup 
in their participation plan that LMR wanted to discuss separately, that was also approved. APX 
Next radio was approved for use on the ARMER system. Mayo had an addition of two 7500e 
consoles to add to their participation plan, that was approved.   
 
5. Interop: (Micah Myers) 
Meeting was March 17th. Standing reports were given. Wisniewski noted there was no quorum. 
 
6. Finance Committee: (Micah Myers) 
Meeting next week. We did meet before the SECB for approval the grants hierarchy. We went 
over CPE grant and had discussions on GIS grant. There are updates to the Grants page on 
ECN’s website. Central Region got their award for our CPE project. The last two remaining are 
Washington County and Scott County. That will complete all of the first round of applications. 
The Finance workgroup had met and provided review of the hierarchy to the Finance 
Committee. Judy Inderlie from the Southeast is chairing that group. We will be meeting next 
week. We will be going over the upcoming SUA renewal with Motorola.  
 
7. Legislative Committee: (Micah Myers) 
Did not meet.  
 
8. Steering Committee: (Kristen Lahr) 
Did not meet.  
 
9. Wireless Broadband and Applications Committee (Brandon Larson) 
Last meeting was March 17th. Most of our announcements with the conference were cancelled. 
We had a review of Televate’s work. Status of the Wireless Broadband survey that many in the 
state have participated in. Review of the strategic plan from Televate and we discussed 
prioritization of carrier tower needs per region. Similar to how ARMER buildout was done with 
prioritization coming from the locals through the regional governance and up. Our next meeting 
coming up this month.  
 
10. Interop – STR Workgroup (Mike Henrion) 
Met on April 7th. One of our standing items is the standards. We agreed to continue to look at 
those, combine and get rid of some of the old language. We have an ongoing thing with the 
tower preventative maintenance checklist. That is something Butch had been working on. Now 
there is talk of Metro group picking that up and continuing that. One item they wanted to bring 
back to the RAC was the formation of STR teams. Mostly for the tower if the tower needed to 
be deployed. In Douglas County, Egan and Henrion have pushed it around when needed.

Reports: (Continued) 
SRB/ARMER Update; MnDPS/MnDOT: (Continued) 
10. Interop – STR Workgroup (Mike Henrion) 
Maybe Wisniewski from Todd County, Egan, and Henrion are the only ones that went through 
the original training. Some other people are well-versed on it, but is that something we want to 
bring up at a future RAC for discussion about forming a group of people that set it up more 
often; where we have a team that we can deploy with the tower if it needs to go somewhere else? 
Myers asked the group if anyone wanted to participate in that group. Larson would. Henrion 
noted Al Fjerstad used to be pretty well versed in it and he has moved on. We can always 
continue to schedule it when everything goes back. Maybe have an annual set-up like we have in 
the past at the O&O/Users where we can get more people involved. Our STR tower is not like 
the other ones where you need to have a crew, but if we did take it to someplace it would be nice 
that someone was there that was familiar with the operation. The talk at the meeting was if it 
needs to go to another county especially out of our region, the last thing they might be able to do 
is take some of their staff to come bring it. The team might be just to get it to where they need to 
get it and the original set-up. That is kind of what we are doing now in the Central Region. 
Myers responded we will try and do our best and we will get it on one of those O&Os.  
 
Regional Leadership Group – (Next Meeting July 27, 2020) 
At the MnDOT facility in St. Cloud 
 
NG-911 Committee (Jason Karlgaard) 
We had our meeting on April 9th. At that meeting the Vice Chair position was vacant with the departure 
of Jason Wendt. Sarah Booker from Todd County was elected the Vice Chair. She also volunteered to 
be the regional StatusBoard representative for our region. We also had a lot of talk on COVID issues. 
We set-up to do a weekly PSAP roundtable to discuss COVID stuff and sharing ideas between PSAPs of 
the region. We are doing that every Thursday at 10 a.m. using the conference bridge.  
 
EMAC Committee: (Stephanie Johnson) 
EMAC met on April 22nd. We talked about some COVID updates within our region. We also received 
updates and reports from fiscal agent and regional contractor. We found out that SHSP we somehow 
missed the documentation from the state on that grant, and they reached out to us asking where our grant 
application was. We were able to submit the grant application to the state. We will be talking about it at 
the next ESB meeting to get official approval on that. We did submit that same grant application as last 
year for $89,250.00. We did have an emergency session on Friday, April 24th for EMAC approval.  
 
Owners & Operators Committee: (Kristen Lahr) 
Did not meet in March/April. We do have a meeting planned for the 21st to discuss on the O&O side 
some Motorola security update service options that came from John Anderson. Also maybe discuss, in 
conjunction, additional discussion beyond NG911, the Rapid Deploy project ECN is socializing 
throughout the state. We do have a meeting conflict with the COOP tabletop exercise planned in 
September. Jointly with the User Committee we will discuss what we should do with that date since a 
lot of the people that would be going to that tabletop exercise are involved in the two committees.  
 
User Committee: 
1. CM ESB 2020 Training RFP 
Myers reported the 2020 Training RFP has been approved. Rey Freeman reached out to Myers looking 
at how we are going to go about scheduling with COVID. Have we got any consideration in doing 
remote style learning for any of those curriculum? Lahr thinks it is something we should put on our next 
agenda for O&O/Users to discuss. Look at the training courses that we have approved for this year and 
take some hard decisions on how we will provide that. Or, if we try to push the dates of all the training 
out toward the second half of the year.

Executive Committee: 
Meeting next week.  
 
Emergency Services Board: (Next meeting June 10, 2020) 
a. CMNESB 2021 Draft Budget  
Myers explained that is the primary reason we are meeting today, their next meeting is June 10th. We 
will present a draft budget to them. Myers took last year’s budget, but as we go through it, there are 
some things in it. It actually worked out for us this year because we had a line item in there for the 
analyzer, so we were able to do that. We did not have to go back to the membership for that. Myers 
asked how many years did we buy on that? Larson reported just one year. Myers asked do you want to 
leave it as an ongoing? Will they make that available to us next year? Larson stated he was sure they 
will, they were willing to do a multiyear purchase, but we just did a one-year. Myers showed the 
current contributions. For the Logger, the one that changed, we have Washington County addition. 
When they go on we will make the adjustment to the Logger contribution. That will be the only thing 
that really changes on that. Looking at the items, you will see there is the analyzer, there is $6,000 in 
there. One of things Myers does not have, but that will come out of the Miscellaneous, is we are going 
to be doing the ADA compliance to the website. We are going to be pulling from there. We are 
looking to get reimbursement back from the other regions. We wanted to give them time to add it into 
their budget. We sent out information on that. There is our annual maintenance contributions for the 
website. That is what we have right now slated in the budget. Is there any questions or concerns? Do 
we want to remove or reduce? This is a draft we will present to the board at their next meeting and 
they will make the determination if they want to make any revisions they will send that back to us. 
And we will get back to them for July 29th will be the meeting that they finalize the budget. We will 
have two meetings from the RAC after we present the draft budget to the ESB. Lahr asked did you say 
there was a line item indicated in the 2021 budget for the ADA compliance? Myers replied that will 
come out of the Miscellaneous. We can wait to get all the other regions on board, but per the board, 
they want to move it forward so we do not have that liability sitting out there. One way, or the other, 
we will pick up the tab, but then moving forward we are looking to get the contribution back from the 
other participating members. The other website line you see in there that is our annual maintenance 
that includes us getting down the road. We are pre-paying for the refresh, or the revise it up, the 
website when our contract comes due. We just replaced the batteries in the STR. Is there anything 
else, because we are getting down. The battery took us down. We have a balance of about $5,000 in 
there. One of the things we talked about is as those radios age, is there thought to how do we replace 
those and any additional items we want to put in the STR to get that on the radar to start planning? We 
have a good two years with what we have in the balance to cover general maintenance, but at some 
point we have to look at what we do with that STR going forward. Analyzer too, Larson had presented 
a replacement for it when we did not think we were able to get maintenance. But, as long as we can 
keep maintenance on the one is the group comfortable with leaving the line item in for analyzer to 
cover the maintenance until we make a determination we need to replace it? Lahr would stay Stearns 
County is comfortable holding the status quo. Myers asked is there any other discussion and called a 
role call vote to move the draft budget presented here today forward to the ESB board for approval. 
Roll call vote: City of St. Cloud–Approved; Benton–Approved; Big Stone–Approved; Douglas–
Approved; Grant–Approved; Meeker–Approved, Morrison–Approved; Otter Tail–Approved; Pope–
Approved; Stearns–Approved; Stevens–Approved; Todd–Approved; Traverse–Approved; Wadena–
Approved; Wilkin– Approved.  
 
Updates from Partners on Current Projects:

General Discussion and New Business: 
NG911 Grant 
1. GIS – Process  
Myers reported right now we have two grants out there. One is the GIS grant. That has been 
approved. We sent out addendums to the membership. The other thing we are asking. Shari 
reached out to find out the approval process for receiving funds. We are asking your boards, we 
are starting to see those come in. We know we have some scheduled out for the next board 
meetings. The grant paperwork is loaded. Once we have finalized those we will actually put it 
into the hopper, so that you can start doing the work, because we will get the agreement signed.  
 
2. CPE –  Equipment 
Myers reported that has been awarded. We have had several meetings now with the Motorola 
team. Larson met with their engineering, because we are questioning some stuff on the firewall 
side. Myers has met with their admin team a couple weeks ago. We went through what was 
approved and what each of the agencies are doing, so they will be reaching out to you to get 
those moving. We are trying to identify a timeline. There are some constraints. Otter Tail 
County was able to continue to move forward, because there is a component of this hosted CPE 
that requires CenturyLink lines to be installed into each of the participating members. And that 
goes through ECN and they have been having some issues with CenturyLink so that process is 
kind of slowing down. That is going to be the biggest hold-up on this project until we get that 
moving forward. Otter Tail was given the authority to go through. Kandiyohi was scheduled for 
the end of this month, and that is kind of on hold, but that might get moved forward. Myers has 
to reach out to the Swift County Sheriff because there are some questions on their proposal, but 
other than Douglas, Kandiyohi, and Otter Tail, all of the dollar amounts that were put in that 
were authorized expenditures have been approved. For our grant application, there is not a 
match. Myers stated Douglas County = $15,211; Grant County = $26,082; Kandiyohi = 
$13,432; Otter Tail = $13,963; Pope = $26,082; Stevens = $26,082; Swift = $26,082; Todd = 
$7,500; Wadena = $16,267; Wilkin = $26,082. Total award for the region was $196,784.52. 
Larson is working through with Northland Business on the technical components as to getting 
the firewall. There was discussion does there need to be a firewall at each of the agencies. It is 
not our belief, but there are some technical things they are working on where it would just be a 
firewall connection at the two host sites.  
 
Myers reported yesterday the Grants Workgroup went through, established priorities and 
identified what each region’s potential grant applications would fall and whether, or not, they 
were on the SECB or the SHSP grants. We are trying to get a turnaround within 60 days to have 
the applications presented to the board for approval so the funding can start coming to those. We 
are anticipating around that July timeframe the monies will start being available on those. We 
will continue to meet monthly with that Grants Workgroup to work through the current SECB 
and SHSP grant. The bigger thing on the SHSP is what we talked about as part of the hierarchy 
not dictating our applications, but our needs dictating what we put into the hierarchy. The next 
task for that group we will put out the hierarchy for 2021. We are hoping to get that done in the 
fall. That will come from anything that is not funded from the projects. Like BDAs are not going 
to be eligible under the SECB grant. They are going to be going to the SHSP grant. We are 
going to need to make sure we get those out there, because the SHSP grant for the last few years 
has been solely training. That was because information was not getting to HSEM for our needs. 
What the Grants Workgroup is working on is to establish to the state and to the Feds as to what 
our needs are, so if there is eligible funding made available we will get that.  
 
Other 
None.

Upcoming Meetings:  
June 12, 2020 – Alexandria Fire Hall 
 
Myers stated no one knows, or has a magic 8 ball on it, but the meeting is slated for June 12th. We will 
have to either give Douglas County notification if we are going to cancel, so they can free that up. Right 
now, it will be in person, otherwise we will do another crack at the Teams meeting.  
 
Myers added there is one item he got late this week. The Standards workgroup put out some changes to 
Standard 8.10 which deals with the representation at the SECB from each of the regions and how that 
rotation schedule is. There is some clean-up items. We will be presenting that at the next meeting for 
approval.  
 
Larson announced normally when the meetings are in-person we roll the Logger meeting immediately 
after, but the Logger will meet at 11:30 as the appointment is on the agenda. Sheriff Riley noted we 
have a 3rd District Sheriff’s call at 11:30 a.m., so those sheriffs that are on the Logger will not be there. 
Myers asked would you be adverse to starting it early? We have everyone that would be on that call. 
Myers asked could we start the meeting at 11 a.m.? Otter Tail County seconded that request. Larson said 
take a 10 minute break and then jump into the other one. It is a different room for the meeting. 
 
Adjournment:  
Pope County made a motion to adjourn the meeting. Todd County seconded. Myers stated if no 
discussions, and asked for approval, and the motion was carried unanimously to adjourn at 10:51 a.m. 
 
Minutes recorded by Shari Gieseke. 
 
 
Due to the Governor's Stay At Home Order during the Coronavirus pandemic, Central Region meetings may be

As you are aware, Tusa Consulting was hired by ECN to assist the state with ARMER System Upgrade Agreement

review local ARMER‐related service contracts for duplications of billing and opportunities for efficiencies.  Tusa would 
like to wrap this task and asks, if you would like them to review your contract, that you forward it to them by June 
15.  You may send them directly to Dennis Ward (dennis.ward@tusaconsulting.com) or route them through your me

TO:             All RAC Chairs 
FROM:       Cathy Anderson, Standards & Training Coordinator 
RE:              Standard for consideration 
The Standards workgroup has reviewed the following standard and recommended that each region review it 
and provide their feedback before it goes to the Steering Committee.   
PLEASE INCLUDE IT IN YOUR NEXT REGIONAL MEETING (RAC, O/O, Users, etc.) AND LET ME KNOW THE 
OUTCOME, INCLUDING ANY FEEDBACK, FROM YOUR REGION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  TARGET DATE IS MAY 
31, BUT LET ME KNOW IF YOUR REGION WILL NOT BE MEETING IN MAY (or if they already met).   
8.1.0 – Greater Minnesota Regional ESB / ECB Statewide Emergency Communications Board Member 
Selection 
This standard explains how selection occurs for regional representatives and defines their rotation of 
appointments to serve as a member and alternate of the SECB.  
The workgroup’s changes include:  
 
Purpose / Objective: 
• Removed the word radio, as regional boards are no longer exclusively for radio and have a broader 
spectrum of SECB standards.  
 
Operational Context: 
• Removed the “Represents” column so as not to have to make changes every time a region adds or 
loses an entity.  Additionally, if listing, it should be consistent with the signatories on each region’s JPA 
and would have to list them all. 
• Workgroup felt it is not necessary to know how many are represented and that this particular historical 
information is not needed.   
• The Workgroup felt it was important to call out that this standard goes to regions prior to going to the 
SECB.  
 
Recommended Procedure: 
• Service Year table was updated based on scheduled rotation through 2037.

Statewide Radio Board Member Selection

The Central Minnesota Regional ESB was the first Regional Radio Board formed.  They 
appointed a member and alternate to serve on the SECB in June 2007. After all regions 
constituted boards, regional leadership from Greater Minnesota began discussions to create a 
process for the rotation of representation to ensure that all regions of the state had equal and 
appropriate opportunity to serve on the SECB representing the interests of Greater Minnesota. 
This standard has been approved by the Regional Advisory Committees (RACs) and Regional 
ESB/ECBs representing all regions in Greater Minnesota. 
 
4.  Recommended Protocol/ Standard 
 
The Regional ESB/ECBs in Greater Minnesota will have the responsibility to select both 
alternate and primary SECB representatives in rotation, based on seniority by date of their 
Board’s formation.  
 
• In year one, the senior Board shall select a member to serve as a member of the SECB. 
The next senior Board shall select a member to serve as alternate.  
• In year two, the alternate from the previous year would serve as an SECB member 
representing Greater Minnesota ESB/ECBs, and the next senior board would select a 
member to serve as an alternate. 
  
If an alternate is not available to serve for any reason (i.e., Regional ESB/ECB term expiration, 
resignation, etc.) the appointing Regional ESB/ECB is responsible for appointing a member 
to serve. An ESB/ECB may select, by majority vote, to waive their right to serve.  
 
If a Regional ESB/ECB representing a Greater Minnesota region determines not to appoint 
an alternate for their appointment period, the next Board in rotation shall make the 
appointment. The Board waiving their right to serve shall again be considered for service on 
the next full rotation of the seniority list. The rotation will continue until all Boards selecting 
to serve have had the opportunity. When the least senior Board has completed the selection 
process, the next selection shall start again at the top of the list. 
 
Since the Central Minnesota Regional ECB has appointed a member to serve since its 
formation, this process will start with the next senior Regional ESB/ECB for the first rotation.  
 
5.  Recommended Procedure
