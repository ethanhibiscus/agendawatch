specifications for the improvement, was performed within the right of way for which 
damages have been determined and paid for the construction and future maintenance of the 
system, and was performed by the contractor in a timely and workmanlike manner by the 
contractor.  
 
7. 
The engineer has concluded that all amounts under the contract, including change orders 
and penalties, if any, have been duly paid to the contractor and that any retainage should 
be released to the contractor as provided in the contract.

8. 
Upon receipt of the engineer’s report, the auditor set a time and location for a hearing on 
the report, gave notice of the hearing by mail to affected landowners and by posting at the 
meeting place at least ten days before the hearing, and included an invitation in the notice 
that a party objecting to the acceptance of the contract may appear and be heard. 
 
9. 
The hearing was opened for public comment.  
 
10. 
The contract has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications.  
 
Order: 
 
Based on the foregoing Findings and the entire record of proceedings before the Board, the Blue

hereby orders as follows: 
 
1. The contract herein is accepted as complete.

exercise of the aforesaid rights.  Nothing in this paragraph shall limit BEC, its tenants, or

the time of commencement of construction and (ii) replace any fences removed or damaged 
which may immediately and directly result from the exercise of the rights herein granted.

or for any damage(s) resulting to the property of BEC except where expressly provided for 
in the Easement as amended by this Agreement. MPL will use commercially reasonable 
efforts to complete restoration of BEC’s Land within ninety (90) days from completion of 
the Project. 
 
12. Notice for Excavation Activities.  Except in the case of emergencies, MPL will provide 
BEC a minimum of 72 hours’ advance notice for any excavation related maintenance

done in reasonably prudent manner to minimize damage to the BEC Land.

two (2) consecutive years, excepting any period of non-use caused by reason of force 
majeure, including but not limited to strikes, labor troubles, governmental regulations, Acts 
of God and other causes beyond MPL’s reasonable control, then MPL’s rights hereunder

reasonable time period following receipt of such notice, either (a) remove the MPL 
Facilities or (b) purge MPL’s pipeline of product, fill the line with an inert substance and 
abandon the MPL Facilities in place.

Main Motion – Introduces new business.  A main motion is the lowest ranking motion, and a member may make only when no 
other business is pending.  
Subsidiary Motion – Assist in handling the main motion.  Always apply to another motion that is pending.  Is in order from the 
time the chair states the main motion until the motion is voted on.  
Privileged Motion – Do not relate to the pending motion, but deal with special matters of immediate and overriding importance.   
 
RANKING MOTIONS 
1. Main Motion – Introduces a Substantive question as a new subject.  
2. Postpone Indefinitely – reject main motion without a direct vote.  
3. Amend – alter or modify the wording of a main motion.  A primary amendment modifies the main motion; a secondary 
amendment modifies the primary amendment.   
Can amend a motion in 3 ways:  
• 
Insert or add words – insert words at the beginning, middle or end of motion.  
• 
Strike out words or paragraph – Remove words or a paragraph.  
• 
Strike out and insert words or substitute a paragraph – Remove certain words or paragraphs and replace them 
with others.   
4. Commit or refer – to refer a motion to a smaller group or committee.  
5. Postpone to a certain time – delay consideration of a main motion until later in the same meeting or until the next 
scheduled meeting.  
6. Limit or extend limits of debate – a motion that limits or changes the number of times a member make speak or the time 
consumed by a speech, or total time for debate.  A motion to limit the debate applies to all motions previously made and 
that may subsequently be made, but a motion to extend limits of debate only affects motions that are still pending.  
7. Previous question – a motion to close the debate, or call for the question, so the pending motion will come to an 
immediate vote.  
8. Lay on the table – a motion to set aside the main motion temporarily to take up a more pressing issue. 
9. Call for the order of the day – a request made to follow the adopted agenda.  
10. Raise a question of privilege – interrupt the discussion of business to bring up an urgent subject. Ex: Noise or 
temperature of the room, to received handout materials, or see a presentation.  
11. Recess – to take a short intermission in the meeting 
12. Adjourn – to close the meeting 
13. Fix the time to which to adjourn – to set a time, date, and place to continue the present meeting anytime before the next 
regularly scheduled meeting.  
 
** A resolution must have at least 3 yes votes to pass whether there are 3, 4, or 5 Commissioners present.
