RESOLUTION NO. 20-  
(June 9, 2020) 
By Mr. Berwanger, Chairman of the Agriculture Committee: 
DAIRY MONTH PROCLAIMED 
WHEREAS, The month of June as Dairy Month started out as National Milk Month in 
1937 as a way to promote drinking milk.  It was initially created to stabilize the dairy demand 
when production was at a surplus, but has now developed into an annual tradition that celebrates 
the contributions the dairy industry has made to the world; and   
WHEREAS, Dairy Month is a great way to start the summer with nutrient-rich dairy 
foods.  From calcium to potassium, dairy products like milk contain nine essential nutrients 
which may help to better manage your weight, reduce your risk for high blood pressure, 
osteoporosis and certain cancers; and  
WHEREAS, Whether it is protein to help build and repair muscle tissue of active bodies 
or Vitamin A to help maintain healthy skin, dairy products are a natural nutrient powerhouse; 
and  
WHEREAS, Wyoming County is the leading milk producing county in New York State 
in terms of total milk production and cow numbers; and
WHEREAS, The average dairy farm in New York State is family owned and consists of 
135 cows.  Wyoming County farms produce an average of 23,936 pounds (or 2,783 gallons) of 
milk per cow per year, with a total Wyoming County milk production of 1.1 billion pounds (or 
131.3 million gallons) with 47,200 milk cows; and  
WHEREAS, The top three leading dairy counties in New York State are Wyoming, 
Cayuga and St. Lawrence; now therefore  
BE IT RESOLVED, That the Wyoming County Board of Supervisors does hereby 
proclaim June 2020 to be: 
DAIRY MONTH IN WYOMING COUNTY   
to honor our dairy farmers and the safe, wholesome products that they produce and encourage all 
our citizens to drink milk and enjoy other dairy foods to help strengthen our economy.
