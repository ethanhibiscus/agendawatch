Chair’s Report - Small Business Revolving Loan (SBRL) Fund 
The Chair directed attention the the enclosed press release from Tom Knipe, Deputy Director 
of Economic Development, City of Ithaca.  The program received 157 applications and 97 were 
funded.  The program targeted microenterprises of fewer than 5 employees (including the 
owner/s).  Businesses of this size had difficulty accessing other federal programs. 
 
Mendizabal said that she had read one of the businesses, Shortstop Deli was partnering with 
area nonprofits to provide meals for those in need and asked if Members knew how that was 
going.  Farrell said that news of the program was posted on the Washington Park 
neighborhood listserv and that many neighbors had contributed.  
 
 
VI.
HUD Entitlement Grant Program 2020 
A.
Status of IURA-Recommended Projects 
Farrell asked were Project Growing Hope was in documenting whether or not over 50% of 
participants are LMI.  Mendizabal stated that documentation is still in progress as they are still 
registering gardeners and collecting data.  She will reach out again. 
Mendizabal reported that HETP was still planning on conducting its program in a classroom 
environment, if possible.  HETP has found that the group training allows participants to support 
each other and network, which is a valuable component.  Mendizabal noted that currently HETP is 
supporting its participants remotely, sharing the example of one participant who was placed in a 
front-line job just before the pandemic.  HETP has been in touch with that participant by phone, 
giving him support and helping him with some needs that have arisen and have been hard to meet 
during the pandemic.  HETP has stated it will try to remain nimble, and adjust if needed, so could 
potentially go to a different program model if social distancing measures stay in effect during the 
2020/21 program year. 
 
HETP and ReUse both expressed thanks for being recommended projects, and were understanding 
of the scaling that occurred.  Other applicants Mendizabal has been in touch with were likewise 
appreciative of being recommended, even if scaled. 
 
B.
Next Steps/Look Ahead 
Mendizabal reported that the 2020 HUD Entitlement Action Plan is proceeding as it normally does. 
Though HUD has issued waiver for the expedited public engagement process, since this funding 
does not arrive until Fall, we probably will not need the expedited process.  The next Public Hearing 
will occur at the May 13 Planning and Economic Development Committee (PEDC) of Common 
Council. 
 
VII.
Overview:  HUD Mega-waiver 
Mendizabal explained that HUD has issued a large number of waivers for its various programs, 
explained in a wide-reaching memo.  Collectively, this is being called the “Mega-waiver.” 
Waivers of particular import to the HUD Entitlement Program is the expedited public 
engagement process whereby grantees notify HUD of intention to use the expedited process 
two days in advance of the five-day public engagement process for CDBG-CV (among other 
programs) proposals.  The expedited five-day public engagement process must include 
provisions for written comment and a live-streamed virtual hearing with provisions allowing 
the public to comment in real time.  Notice about the expedited public process need not 
appear in the newspaper, but must be posted on various public platforms.  So far Mendizabal 
has posted notice on the Human Services Listserv, the Tompkins County Mutual Aid Facebook 
Page (devoted to COVID news), in emails to Alderpeople, in emails to funded partners, and 
more.   The first two of this type of hearings were held at Common Council on May 6 for the 
Third Amendment to the Citizen Participation Plan and the proposed CDBG-CV Emergency 
Rental Assistance program. 
 
Another important waiver waives the 15% cap on Public Services funding for CDBG-CV and the 
2020 Action Plan.  Action Plans from 2019 may also reprogram funds toward Public Services 
and exceed the usual 15% cap.  Substantial amendments must be filed. 
 
The resolution for the Third Amendment (disaster-related changes) to the CP Plan was adopted 
on May 6.  The proposal for Emergency Rental Assistance will go to PEDC on May 6. 
 
VIII.
New/Other Business 
A.
CARES ACT CDBG - CV Funding to the City of Ithaca 
1.
Amount, framework 
2 
 
Entitlement Communities receive (an additional) 60% of this year’s regular annual award 
allocation in CDBG-CV.  The City of Ithaca will receive approximately $400K in CDBG-CV funding, 
of which $320K will be available for projects. 
 
2.
Approaches to select activities for funding from CDBG-CV funds 
HUD has not provided extensive guidance about how to allocate this funding, except to say to 
get it into the community “quickly and compliantly.”  Further guidance is expected with the 
award arrives.  In keeping with the instruction to distribute it “quickly and compliantly,” Staff 
recommended a process that involves parallel pathways:  solicited projects and an expedited 
RFP process.  Stakeholder input indicates that emergency rental assistance, COVID prevention 
and relief for people experiencing homelessness, and relief for nonprofits, especially anchor 
institutions, are needed.  Proposals for these needs will likely be solicited, and, in fact, in the 
case of rental assistance already have been.  Staff is developing a modified RFP which will be 
released hopefully next week, by which applicants with ideas and solutions for emerging needs 
can propose projects. 
 
3.
Priority needs/gaps to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic  
Emergency rental assistance, disease prevention and recovery for people experiencing 
homelessness, and assistance to nonprofits, particularly anchor institutions.  Mendizabal noted 
that LawNY contacted her with ideas related to eviction prevention and she will be in contact 
with them for the RFP.  Mendizabal has also joined a local funders’ collaborative headed up by 
Park and Community Foundations on COVID Response. 
 
Mendizabal explained Emergency Rental Assistance is a CDBG-compliant activity and cannot be 
used for more than three consecutive months.  It is part of an “emergency grant” category, it is 
not the same as HOME Program Tenant-Based Rental Assistance.  Tompkins County 
reprogrammed about $600K in CDBG funding that was to be used by INHS for homeowner 
rehab; it will not be used for emergency rental assistance.  In order to join with the County, and 
INHS, which has some additional funding streams that it will direct to rental assistance, and to 
create the most seamless process possible, IURA also identified INHS as the proposed sponsor 
of this project.  In this way, anyone applying to this program within the county can go through 
the same agency.  INHS has experience with administering a variety of federal funding streams 
and the capacity to do so for this type of project.  INHS is currently developing the framework 
for its program.  There was a conversation convened by HSC’s Hoousing Tompkins program to 
explore the possibility of a coordinated entry approach (similar to what is now used by the 
Continuum of Care for homeless housing), in order to incorporate more wrap-around services. 
It remains to be seen whether this will be the approach taken.  There has been some public 
comment that INHS does not have experience administering rental assistance.  There has also 
been public comment indicating potential conflict of interest since INHS is both a landlord and 
would be administering the program.  IURA Staff has reached out to HUD for further guidance. 
Similarly, were a relative of INHS Board, IURA Staff, etc. to apply to the program, this could 
represent a conflict of interest.  
 
Halpert asked about the negotiating with landlords about the amount of rental assistance paid, 
which could thereby extend the reach of the pool of funds.  Mendizabal acknowledged that this 
was idea considered, yet, because of the need to review applications, the time and staff hours 
involved, and more reasons, the approach that was instead landed on was provision of three 
full months of rent per household accepted.  However, Mendizabal pointed out that if further 
3 
 
funding comes to the City, lessons learned in this round of rental assistance could be applied to 
future programming, and modifications made, if needed. 
 
Halpert also wondered about delivery of food and needed goods to residents via school buses. 
This has been an effort sponsored by Ithaca City School District.  Chair Graham noted that the 
Child Development Council was involved in the provision of diapers. 
 
4.
Identification of further priority needs 
The RFP process and the funders’ collaborative for COVID Response will be an important way of 
garnering more information. 
 
5.
Draft schedule to develop CDBG-CV Action Plan 
Mendizabal has drafted a schedule which is available on the IURA Website.  RFP to be released 
next week and applications reviewed at the next IURA meeting (May 23).
