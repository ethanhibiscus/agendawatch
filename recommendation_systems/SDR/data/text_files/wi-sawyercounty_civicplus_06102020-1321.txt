June, 2020 Highway Commissioner’s Report 
 
A small crew has been pulling in shoulders on state highways.  After completing state highways, they will 
start to work on some county highways. 
 
The crew finished crack sealing our Pbm (Performance Based Maintenance) project on STH 77, from 
Peters Road to Ross Road.   
 
Crack sealing has also been performed on County Road F, from Sissabagama Road to STH 27/70. 
 
Pipe installation has started on this summer’s highway projects.  A few pipes have been installed on CTH 
H.  Work will continue on the other pipe installations on this year’s projects as time permits.   
 
There are currently no employees out on worker’s compensation. 
 
Progress continues in the design stages for the Couderay River Bridge on CTH E.  The sales study has 
been completed and right-of-way negotiations may begin soon.  It is doubtful that this bridge will be 
replaced in 2020.  As late as it is getting in the bid letting cycle, that may not be a bad thing as the bids 
are typically higher in the late summer/fall.  
 
The crew continues to work under the COVID-19 guidelines established by the Sawyer County Public 
Health Officer.  Aside from the minor inconvenience of wearing masks when in buildings, the guidelines 
have not had any impact on our ability to complete our jobs. 
 
One skilled and one seasonal flagger started work on May 18, 2020.  Another skilled worker and one 
additional seasonal flagger started on June 1, 2020.

The Sawyer County/Lac Courte Oreilles Economic Development Trail Committee and Sawyer County 
Snowmobile & ATV Alliance have been working with local residents to connect businesses on Hwy B & 
Hwy CC to an ATV route on Hwy CC by Big Musky Resort. 
We are now requesting Hwy CC open for ATV travel from Hwy B to Hwy CC near Big Musky Resort which 
has been an ATV route for several years.  This would connect businesses to the Hwy CC ATV route. 
The Town of Hunter approved Hwy CC from Hwy B to Big Musky Resort at their May town meeting 
contingent on county approval.   
 
Presented by: 
Don Mrotek, Sawyer County Snowmobile and ATV Alliance 
Chris Ruckdaschel, Sawyer County/Lac Courte Oreilles Economic Development Corporation and Hayward

Maintenance Report 
June 2020 
 
Along with routine maintenance, the following maintenance projects were 
started or completed in May: 
    
I. Courthouse: 
 Renovations in the Child Support Office are approximately seventy-
five percent complete.   
 We are still in the process of obtaining transaction window estimates.  
 We purchased a Kaivac machine to ensure that public restrooms and 
other high use areas are being disinfected as thoroughly as possible.  
All Maintenance and Custodial personnel have received the 
necessary training for correctly operating the new equipment. 
 A suspended ceiling and new light fixtures have been installed in 
Surveying, so renovations in that area have been completed.  
 
II. Highway: 
 A glass transaction window has been ordered for the main reception 
area and should be installed within two weeks. 
 
III. Ambulance: 
 The parking lot and drive way in Ojibwa have been paved.  
Shouldering work is scheduled to be completed within the next two 
weeks. 
 Don Thompson and Sons took care of installing topsoil and seeding 
the west and south areas of the building site that were originally going 
to be covered with asphalt.

Code Review – Fire Separation
• Discussed project with State Code Official, Erik Hansen (WI Dept. 
of Safety & Professional Services). 
• Remodeling work in Existing Courthouse will not require fire 
sprinkler (less than 50% of Courthouse size).
• Connection between Existing Courthouse and new Courts Addition 
may require a fire separation (similar to HHS and Child Support 
Additions).          Fire Rating TBD.
• Will Review with Erik Hansen During Final Design Phase.
