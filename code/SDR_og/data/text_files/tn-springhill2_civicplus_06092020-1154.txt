All- 
 
In an effort to better communicate, I have created an expanded project list for the TN Special Grant to include additional 
projects (highlighted in red In the spreadsheet), costs and department.  We still need cost estimates for the WTP 
potential projects as well as to confirm if Tom Lunn Road qualifies.   
 
Victor- can you please include this document once completed in our special called meeting packet?   
 
Lastly, per our discussion last night on the WWTP Land acquisition, drainage, oxidation  projects where we will look to 
move a total of $4.5Million originally slated for WWTP expansion - we will need to determine the specific projects and 
phasing to know what the budget amendment/allocation needs to be over the next 3-4 years. 
 
Thanks! 
 
Amy

identify a funding source based upon the conversation on June 2nd.
