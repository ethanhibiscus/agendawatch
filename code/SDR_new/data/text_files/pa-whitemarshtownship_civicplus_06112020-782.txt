ANNOUNCEMENTS 
 
 
Tom Blomstrom, Director of Parks and Recreation  
 
Mr. Blomstrom stated he hopes that Township families are remaining safe & healthy during these 
extraordinary times. As has been announced in the media, many summer programs, activities, and special 
events are being cancelled throughout the County, Region, and State due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Understandably, the Township has been receiving questions regarding how COVID-19 will affect our Parks 
and Recreation summer camps this year.  As a result and to best serve and communicate with the public, 
the Parks and Recreation Department has developed a landing page on the Township Website under Parks 
and 
Recreation 
titled 
“Summer 
Camp 
COVID 
19 
Updates”. 
 
The 
direct 
link 
is 
https://www.whitemarshtwp.org/Summer-Camp-COVID-19-Updates  This web page will provide answers 
to some of the most common camp-related questions that we have received. It will also include the most 
up-to-date summer camp information made available by our department. This information will be updated 
as developments occur, so participants are encouraged to check back periodically.  The landing page will be 
live at 4:00pm on Thursday, May 14th. At this time, all Whitemarsh Township summer camps are currently 
running as scheduled. The Parks and Recreation Team are diligently working to develop new processes & 
protocols aimed to maintain a safe and healthy camp environment, which is always our top priority. This 
continues to be an extremely fluid situation, and our department will continue to monitor and abide by all 
guidance provided by the Governor, County, CDC, and DOH, as well as professional recommendations by 
NRPA & PRPS, as are possible. Please note that, as these guidelines and recommendations become clearer 
in forthcoming weeks, the Township will be determining the best course for participant and employee 
safety.  This may lead to cancellation of camps and trips, delaying the beginning start dates of camps, 
reducing the participant attendance at camps, altering hours and camp structures, implementing new 
inclement weather policies, and requiring a variety of new safety protocols. In the event that there are any 
relevant updates or changes to our 2020 summer camp plans moving forward, we will be sure to 
communicate them to the Website “Summer Camp COVID 19 Updates” landing page as soon as possible.

On a motion by Supervisor McCusker, seconded by Supervisor Drossner (Vote 5-0) the Board of 
Supervisors approved the April 9, 2020 meeting minutes. 
 
BOARD PUBLIC DISCUSSION ITEMS 
 
ORDINANCES 
 
1. 
3-way Stop Sign at West Valley Green Road and Hunt Lane and 3-way Stop Sign at West Valley 
Green Road and Creek Lane 
 
 
Mr. Mellor began by explaining Montgomery County is getting ready to open the West Valley 
Green Bridge.  The stop signs proposed will slow traffic down heading to the bridge.  Supervisor Manuele 
stated installing the stop signs is a life-safety situation.  There was a discussion about the reconstruction of 
the bridge.   Mr. Mellor explained there will be stop signs and they will light up to alert people to stop.  He 
explained the County will be installing them.  He explained this is a life safety issue.  He also explained there 
is a pedestrian crossing near the bridge and this will be another safety precaution. Mr. Mellor stated the 
Township met with County officials and provided Township input.  He explained the signage has been 
collaboration with the County, but it is the Township who enforces the law.  There was a discussion about 
whether or not the signs will be permanent.

May 14, 2020 
Joan Biddle (Henry Lane) asked why speed bumps weren’t considered instead of stop signs.   Mr. 
Mellor explained the County looked at an array of possibilities, he stated because of the bends in the road, 
etc. the road does not warrant speed humps.   
 
On a motion by Supervisor Drossner, seconded by Supervisor Toll (Vote 5-0) the Board of 
Supervisors adopted Ordinance #999 amending Chapter 111, “Vehicles and Traffic”, Article II, “Traffic 
Regulations”, of the Code of the Township of Whitemarsh to establish 3-way stop intersections at West 
Valley Green Road and Hunt Lane and West Valley Green Road and Creek Lane. 
 
2. 
Brake Retarder Restriction on Joshua and Flourtown Roads 
 
Mr. Mellor explained the Township has received several complaints over the past few years with 
regards to large trucks utilizing brake retarders commonly referred to as Jake or J-brakes. They are engaged 
by trucks when downshifting or in the motion of braking. As a result, they are very loud and considered a 
nuisance by those residents who have complained.  He stated the Police Department researched and found 
several surrounding municipalities have ordinances for specific roadways that restrict their use. In order 
place this restriction to occur along a State roadway, it required PENNDOT to perform a study to determine 
if this restriction is permitted.  The Township requested the study last year and PENNDOT authorized the 
Township could allow the brake retarder restriction along the following two sections of State roads:  
Flourtown Road 
  between Butler Pike and Joshua Road and Joshua Road  between Stenton Avenue and 
Flourtown Road 
 
On a motion by Supervisor Manuel, seconded by Supervisor Toll (Vote 5-0) the Board of Supervisors 
adopted Ordinance #1000 amending the Vehicle and Traffic provisions of the Code of the Township of 
Whitemarsh to prohibit the use of Engine Brake Retarders AKA “Jake Brakes” on Flourtown Road from 
Joshua Road to Butler Pike and on Joshua Road from Flourtown Road to Stenton Avenue pursuant to a 
study performed PENNDOT. 
 
RESOLUTIONS  
 
None 
 
MOTIONS  
 
1. 
Non-uniformed Pension Plan 
 
Mr. Mellor explained Nate Crittendon, Director of Finance and I have been evaluating the non-
uniformed pension plans with Michael Courtney from RBC who was appointed plan fiduciary.  He stated the 
Township’s non-uniformed defined contribution and deferred compensation plans are currently with ICMA 
RC. Since a new financial plan manager took over our account a few years ago we have struggled to receive 
consistent and responsive service to our employees. We also have not examined the pricing in the years 
that I have been with the organization. The plan costs are paid for by the Township. These two contributing 
factors are the reason it was prudent to look at other options.  According to Mike Courtney, ICMA RC 
pricing of 15 basis points was high compared to the others in the pension market. We requested ICMA RC 
to provide us better pricing which they came back with 6.5 basis points. When evaluating other options 
Nationwide provided the most competitive pricing at 3 basis points.  Mr. Crittendon and I met with 
4 
 
 
 
 
May 14, 2020 
Nationwide and were very impressed with their funds offered (Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, etc.) which are 
common in retirement plans as well as cost efficient. Also, the customer service plan that Nationwide 
would provide includes meeting with the employees to discuss topics and trends several times per year and 
conducting individual meetings with the employees to review plan performance and make 
recommendations. This is no different than what is provided for the police pension plan but ICMA RC has 
not provided to non-uniformed employees.  He explained Mr. Courtney and Nationwide will have an 
orientation process in order to familiarize employees with the Nationwide funds and web based tools. The 
timeline for implantation is for late summer.  He stated the agreements were reviewed by the Solicitor’s 
office and are acceptable for consideration. 
 
On a motion by Supervisor Drossner, seconded by Supervisor McCusker (Vote 5-0) the Board of 
Supervisors approved the non-uniformed Pension Plan engagement with Nationwide for the Township’s 
Defined Contribution and Deferred Compensation Plans. 
 
2. 
Certificates of Appropriateness 
 
Mr. Guttenplan explained there are two Certificates of Appropriateness for a six-foot shadowbox 
fence to be installed along the rear property lines at 2 and 12 Catherine Lane in the Maple Hill 
Development.  He stated HARB reviewed these two applications at its March 11, 2020 meeting. Noting that 
it was an extension of the same fence that they recommended approval for the prior month, they passed a 
unanimous motion recommending approval of both of the Certificates of Appropriateness. 
 
On a motion by Supervisor McCusker, seconded by Supervisor Toll (Vote 5-0) the Board of 
Supervisors approved the Certificate of Appropriateness for the installation of a fence at 2 Catherine Lane. 
 
On a motion by Supervisor McCusker, seconded by Supervisor Toll (Vote 5-0) the Board of 
Supervisors approved the Certificate of Appropriateness for the installation of a fence at 12 Catherine Lane. 
 
Mr. Guttenplan explained there is a Certificate of Appropriateness for a paver patio and sitting wall 
at 15 Catherine Lane in the Maple Hill Development. This will be constructed in the rear of the home and 
will not be seen from the street. It is proposed to be constructed of E P Henry pavers in various shades of 
gray.  He stated HARB reviewed this proposal at its March 11, 2020 meeting, and noted that it was similar 
to other patios reviewed recently in this development.. They passed a unanimous motion recommending 
approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness for the patio and sitting wall as proposed. 
 
On a motion by Supervisor McCusker, seconded by Supervisor Drossner (Vote 5-0) the Board of 
Supervisors approved the Certificate of Appropriateness for the installation patio and wall at 15 Catherine 
Lane. 
 
3. 
April 2020 Expenditures and Payroll and Pension Plan Paid Costs 
 
On a motion by Supervisor McCusker, seconded by Supervisor Toll (Vote 5-0) the Board of 
Supervisors approved expenditures totaling $1,152,661.86; and payroll totaling $631,169.90 and pension 
paid costs totaling $7,577.52 for April 2020.

Mr. Guttenplan explained there is an additional Certificate of Appropriateness to consider; this one  
is for a paver patio at 4 Catherine Lane in the Maple Hill Development. This will be constructed in the rear 
of the home and will not be seen from the street. It is proposed to be constructed of pavers in gray tones 
(pewter).   HARB reviewed this proposal at its May 13, 2020 meeting, held using 'Zoom' technology. They 
passed a unanimous motion recommending approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness for the patio as 
proposed. 
 
 
 
On a motion by Supervisor Toll, seconded by Supervisor McCusker (Vote 5-0) the Board of

FROM: 
Nathan L. Crittendon, Director of Finance 
SUBJECT:   Revenue Update – Tax Collections 
DATE: 
May 29, 2020 
 
As a proactive response to the economic effects of the COVID pandemic,  the 
Township began monitoring the tax revenues, being the primary revenue stream, 
in a similar fashion as is done during the budgeting process. Provided below is an 
explanatory summary of the findings, as well as a copy of the Township’s financial 
standing for both the end of April and current year to date standing. 
Overall the Township realizes substantial tax collection revenues:   
1. Real Estate Tax 
In the interest of maximizing the fluidity of cashflow, the Finance department 
remained open during pandemic closure, with the approval of the Township 
Manager.  This discussion resulted in the Township achieving 84% of it’s budgeted 
goal by the end of April and 90% of it’s budgeted goal year to date.  To date, over 
3.5 million dollars in collections have been processed, exceeding the prior year’s 
collections by 6%.   
 
2. Act 511 Taxes 
With the Federal Reserve lowering rates, home buying and refinancing interest 
have spiked, benefiting the Township in two significant areas.  The first is seen in 
the higher delinquent collections, as homeowners need to be current on their 
taxes in order to refinance or sell.  The second number is the interim tax, which 
generates as a result of new home purchases.  This number ties into the real 
estate transfer tax.  All three areas are experiencing continued windfalls 
throughout the pandemic period. (Current months transfer tax amounts are not 
received until the following month.  However, home sales have sustained in the 
Township as confirmed by the Recorder of Deeds office.) 
Earned income tax is still on par with prior years collections in local service tax, 
and both earned income tax revenue lines, while business taxes (BPT) 
experienced significant losses in May.  BPT collection shortfalls represent 84%, or 
$1.45 million, of the Act 511 shortfall.  However, with the state changing our 
status to yellow business privilege collections are expected to fall in line by 
quarters end.

Richard L. Mellor, Jr., Township Manager 
 
FROM: 
Nathan L. Crittendon, Director of Finance 
SUBJECT:   401(a) – Cares Act Loan Modification 
DATE: 
May 31, 2020 
 
At the direction of the Township, the Finance Department began the process of 
assessing our retirement plan structure for its ability to comply with the 
intentions of the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act, (CARES Act) 
passed on March 27, 2020.  After reviewing the plan documents with our ICMA 
plan manager, it is determined our plan does not support the intentions of the 
CARES Act, as it is a Money Purchase Plan (MPP), which, in turn, is structured as a 
pension plan.  In order to support the intentions of the CARES Act, the Township 
would have to introduce, by way of the Board of Supervisors, a temporary 
modification to allow employees to take a loan against retirement funds.  It is the 
recommendation of this office, the documents presented to the Board of 
Supervisors this evening be ratified to allow employees experiencing financial 
difficulties due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to attain some assistance 
by way of their retirement savings through December 31, 2020.

Bid Specification # 2019-05 
Whitemarsh Township, Montgomery County, PA 
Project Number 2020-01109 
 
Dear Mr. Mellor: 
 
As requested, we have reviewed the bids submitted to the Township and publicly opened on May 14, 2020 for the 
above referenced project with the following results: 
 
Bid Bond 
Bidder’s Name 
Bid Amount 
10% 
Premier Concrete, Inc. 
$128,900.50 
10% 
Road-Con, Inc. 
$129,534.10 
10% 
Marino Corporation 
$135,413.90 
10% 
Ocean Construction 
$141,624.32 
10% 
Wyoming Electric and Signal 
$211,226.95 
 
Based on the attached bid evaluation that is summarized above, Premier Concrete, Inc. is the lowest responsive bidder 
for the Total Bid for this project.  It is therefore recommended that the Board of Supervisors authorize the Township 
Engineer’s office to issue a Notice of Intent to Award to Premier Concrete, Inc. for the Total Bid cost of $128,900.50. 
 
Final awarding of the contract is contingent upon a successful outcome to the required Responsible Contractor 
Determination that will be performed by our office.  
 
This project, together with a separate signal improvements project at Colonial & Flourtown Roads, will be partially 
funded by a Multimodal Transportation Fund (MTF) grant in the amount of $250,000.00 which will help offset the cost 
of construction. 
 
Should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at this office.  
 
 
 
 
Very truly yours,

Ordinance Amendment to Protect Pavement Surfaces 
 
 
 
 
 
PROJECT NUMBER: 
 
2020-01015 
 
 
As requested, we have prepared suggested language to be considered for incorporation into Chapter 103 
“Streets and Sidewalks” of the Whitmarsh Township Code.  The ordinance amendment would codify a five-year 
moratorium for any new pavement cuts on any roads recently paved or restored in Whitemarsh Township.   
 
Pavement cuts alter and degrade pavement surfaces adjacent to the cut.  Pavement cuts should be limited, in 
order to help preserve pavement integrity, rideability and appearance of new street surfaces.  In the event of 
an emergency, it will occasionally be necessary to cut into a street that has been paved within the past five 
years.  This ordinance amendment will establish the basis and process for determining the level of repair and 
replacement for utility cuts on recently paved streets. 
 
We request that the suggested Ordinance language, attached, be reviewed by the Township Solicitor.  If 
acceptable, the proposed ordinance amendment could be considered by the Board of Supervisors for 
incorporation into the Whitemarsh Township Code. 
 
Should you have any questions or need further information regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to 
contact me at this office.

Add the following to Chapter 103: Streets and Sidewalks: 
 
 
To Section § 103-43: “Definitions”, Add the following Definition: 
MORATORIUM STREET – any street that has been reconstructed or resurfaced in the preceding five (5) year 
period. 
 
 
To Section § 103-49: “Construction in rights-of-way”, Add Section § 103-49(M): 
 
§ 103-49(M) Moratorium on pavement cuts; permits. 
(1)  After any street has been constructed, reconstructed, or paved by Township forces, under Township 
contract, or under permit, a five-year moratorium for any new pavement cuts for those designated 
Moratorium Streets will be in effect. In the event of an emergency, any roadway cuts will require that 
the entity mill and overlay the entire lane of travel in the vicinity of the road cut, thirty-foot minimum in 
each direction from the work area. If such cuts involve both lanes of travel, the milling and overlay will 
extend the entire cartway width in the vicinity of the road cut, 30 feet minimum in each direction from 
the work area. 
 
(2) The Township Engineer may grant exemptions to this prohibition in order to facilitate development on 
adjacent properties, provide for emergency repairs to subsurface facilities, provide for underground 
service connections to adjacent properties or allow the upgrading of underground utility facilities.  
When granting exceptions to this regulation, the Township Engineer may impose conditions determined 
appropriate to insure the rapid and complete restoration of the street and the surface paving.  Repaving 
may include base and sub-base repairs, or other related work as needed, and may include up to full-
width surface paving of the roadway. 
 
(3)  All permits for road cuts are issued at the discretion of the Township.
