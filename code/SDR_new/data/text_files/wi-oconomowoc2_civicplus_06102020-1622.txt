Plan Commission Meeting Minutes 
May 13, 2020 
 
Chairman Magnus called the meeting to order at 6:30 pm and welcomed new members Ald. Lou Kowieski and 
Chad Vande Zande. 
 
Members Present: Commissioners Dean Frederick, Lou Kowieski, Chad Vande Zande, John Gross, Ken 
Brotheridge, Chairman Robert Magnus and Commissioner Steve Ritt 
Others Present: 
Sarah Kitsembel, Jason Gallo, Mark Frye, Atty. Stan Riffle and Chris Dehnert 
 
2. Approve Minutes of March 11, 2020 and April 8, 2020:  Motion by Ritt to approve the March 11, 2020 and 
April 8, 2020 minutes; second by Brotheridge. Motion carried 7-0. 
 
3. Consider/act on the Major Design Review Plans for the Pabst Farms Apartments located on Valley 
Road, east of Old Schoolhouse Road:  Gallo explained this development will consist of 302 apartment units, a 
clubhouse, and detached garages located on a 34 acre parcel. The main access will be off Valley Road with a 
secondary access road to Old Schoolhouse Road. The design, colors and materials were approved at the 
Architectural Commission meeting earlier this evening. There will be (2) 5 unit townhouses, (8) 14-unit and (10) 
18-unit apartment buildings. There will also be a mail kiosk in the center of the development and a trail on the 
north end of the property will connect to the Lake Country Trail. The Pabst Farms Joint Stormwater District 
approved the stormwater plans earlier tonight and all stormwater will drain north to retention ponds which will be 
located in outlots. The ponds will be laid out so they will be expandable and will become regional ponds serving 
the area to the west. The property is zoned Residential Multi-Unit High and the proposed development is in 
compliance with all setbacks, height and zoning requirements.  Gallo explained the zoning code requires 613 
parking stalls, and their plans show parking for 600 in garages and 108 stalls including parking aprons for visitors, 
which he questioned. Landscaping exceeds requirements and the Architectural Commission recommended this 
evening that they add evergreens behind the detached garages on the west elevation to help break up the long 
building elevation.  The wetlands located in the northeast corner will remain in an undisturbed state. The utilities 
are sufficient and there is enough capacity for this development. Lighting plans have been submitted which 
included decorative Pabst Farms bell fixtures, wall mounted lighting and bollards. Staff is comfortable with the 
layout and location of access points.  There is sidewalk within the development but no other sidewalk leading from 
it nor any on Valley Road. Gallo recommends approval as he believes the proposed development is a good use of 
the site.  Items that still need to be addressed however are parking, lighting levels, sidewalk along Valley Road, 
landscaping, construction traffic, retaining walls/fencing details, need more information on onsite recycling center 
and can tenants control their own front entrance lights. Members questioned the status of the sidewalk, noting that 
sidewalk on Valley Road would be in the ROW which requires Waukesha County approval. Ian Martin of the 
Mandel Group offered to pursue being allowed to have sidewalk in the ROW on Valley Road and either dedicate 
the sidewalk to the City or grant public access to it. After discussion with the City Attorney the applicant agreed 
they will maintain the sidewalk. Cialdini explained there will be parking for 600 but they feel they can find space for 
13 additional stalls. She said there are 6 apron parking spots on the (8) 14-unit and (10) 18-unit buildings. The 
smallest parking spot is 16’ in length, and there are some situations where the sidewalk crosses the apron. 
Cialdini said the sidewalk in these locations will be moved slightly to allow for a full parking space. Martin said the 
easiest place to add the 13 stalls would be on the north side of the event lawn behind the clubhouse. Members 
suggested that the additional parking requirement should be included in the development agreement; concern 
with maintaining their own recycling center and asked for City staff to follow up to make sure it is looked at. 
Cialdini will be requesting a variance from the lighting standard because they feel it will be too bright overall and 
are also willing to look at brighter lighting in certain areas. She added each resident will have control over its own 
private entry light. Cialdini said they will include more landscaping on the backside of the detached garages on the

west property line; will be phasing in the construction from south to north; will put down pads to keep the dust 
down; and most access for equipment will go down the new access road. Martin explained the clubhouse will be 
done first and gave the construction timeline and said people will move in as soon as a building gets done. They 
plan to use Valley Road for construction traffic as minimally as possible for the initial phase of construction of the 
clubhouse. Cialdini explained recycling will be done in the trash compactor area. Retaining walls will be located 
along the edges of the site due to the stormwater management system and will consist of some type of block to 
match the stone material on the building. They will try to eliminate as many retaining wall areas, minimize them 
when possible and only include handrails as necessary. Gallo clarified approval should be subject to the technical 
corrections included in the May 1, 2020 letter and that applicant is to submit additional plans to address these 
concerns and any concerns that the Plan Commission has in a digital format. He added concerns that need to be 
addressed are parking; lighting; sidewalk; landscaping upgrades; retaining wall changes; and recycling details.  
Motion by Ritt to approve the Major Design Review Plans for Pabst Farms Apartments on Valley Road subject to 
the applicant addressing all technical items in the May 1, 2020 letter referenced by the City Planner as well as the 
items discussed tonight prior to the release of building permits; second by Frederick.  Motion carried 7-0. 
 
4. Planning Department Correspondence – April 2020:  Gallo reported in the month of April there was 1
