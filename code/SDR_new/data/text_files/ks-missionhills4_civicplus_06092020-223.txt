David & Diane Zimmer 
5924 High Drive 
The Zimmers are returning to the ARB with changes to their previously approved project. 
The new front door portion of this project was continued at the March 26th meeting so a new 
front elevation could be provided that illustrates the proposed front door in context with the 
rest of the front façade. 
Summary of Property: 
• 
Character Area: 
Neighborhood Estates 
• 
Location of Common Green Space: Front 
• 
Any Special Frontages: 
None 
Summary of Project: 
The Zimmers are proposing minor alterations to the shape of their existing circle driveway.  Multiple 
portions of the driveway will be modified to reduce the overall footprint of the driveway.  A new 
band of pavers will be added to the drive surface on axis with the front entry.  
At the south side of the house, they are proposing to relocate an existing wing wall 17 feet back 
from the front corner of the house.  The new wall is 6 feet tall and sided with stucco.  The wall will 
include a new iron gate.  A similar wall and gate will be added to the north side of the house, 
replacing an existing fence. 
A new wood enclosure is proposed around the A/C units at the north side of the house.  The fence 
style will match the home’s existing wood fences. 
The existing front double doors will be replaced with a new single door with sidelights.   
Ordinance Compliance: 
There are no conflicts between the proposed project and the City of Mission Hills Code of 
Ordinances. 
Design Guideline Review: 
Additions to the Design Guidelines, adopted on March 9, 2020, recommend that LS-3 properties 
have a minimum of 65% greenspace.  As proposed, 55.72% greenspace has been provided.  This 
recommendation has not been met.  Please note, this project was approved prior to this Design 
Guideline going into effect.  The proposed changes in this submittal are increasing the total 
greenspace by 229 square feet.

Hadley Burcham 
2710 Verona Terrace 
Ms. Burcham recently appeared before the ARB to propose multiple additions to her 
existing home including a side-entry porch, an enclosed rear porch and a detached 
screened porch.  During the discussion, it was determined that the detached screened 
porch was considered a substantial construction project.  Substantial Construction notice 
letters have been mailed regarding the detached partially-screened porch.  The remainder 
of the project was approved by the ARB at its April 28, 2020 meeting. 
Summary of Property: 
• Character Area: 
 
Neighborhood Estates 
• Location of Common Green Space: 
Front 
• Any Special Frontages: 
 
None 
Summary of Project: 
The detached partially-screened porch is located at the east side of the main house.  It is 
designed in a Tudor style to match the main house.  It also features a fireplace that is 
detailed to match the main house.  The structure is connected back to the main house with 
an open breezeway that matches the breezeway at the detached garage. 
Ordinance Compliance: 
There are no conflicts between the proposed project and the City of Mission Hills Code of 
Ordinances.

Kirk & Stesha Black 
3012 West 67th Terrace 
The Blacks are proposing an interior remodel and a second floor addition.  
Summary of Property: 
• Character Area: 
 
Suburban 
• Location of Common Green Space: 
Front 
• Any Special Frontages: 
 
None 
Summary of Project: 
At the front of the house, all of the windows are being replaced with new units of similar 
size and slightly different style.  The front door will remain.  The new second floor will be 
visible in the form of a large gable that is centered over the front door. 
At the right (east) side of the house, an existing gable will be rebuilt to be centered over an 
existing bay window.  All of the windows will be replaced with new windows to match the 
front. 
At the rear of the house, a new boxed bay window is being added.  The bulk of the floor 
addition is visible in the form of a new shed dormer with a new gable.  The existing 
chimney will be modified to accommodate the additional height.  All existing windows are 
again being replaced in a slightly different configuration.  All of the windows will match the 
remainder of the house, with the exception of a series of large clear-view windows and 
doors at the center of the elevation.   A new egress window well is proposed near the 
center of the house. 
At the left (west) side of the house, windows and doors are being replaced to match. 
Ordinance Compliance: 
There are no conflicts between the proposed project and the City of Mission Hills Code of 
Ordinances. 
Design Guideline Review: 
Section 2.5 on pages 72 through 75 of the Design Guidelines provides specific 
recommendations for the Suburban character area.  Subsection C suggests that side 
wings, located in the conditional building area, be limited to 1 ½ stories and 24 feet in 
height.  A small portion of the new second floor extends into this area, and meets all the 
recommendations.

Katherine & Bob Coughlin 
2223 West 63rd Street 
The Coughlins are returning to the ARB with changes to their previously approved project. 
Summary of Property: 
• Character Area: 
 
Neighborhood Estates 
• Location of Common Green Space: 
Front 
• Any Special Frontages: 
 
None 
Summary of Project: 
In lieu of traditional drawings, the Coughlins have provided photographs of the house as it 
stands today. 
They recently failed their final inspection.  Most of the issues were related to errors on the 
original drawings that indicated windows being replaced that were not in the project scope. 
At the west side of the new addition, two windows were omitted from the project scope. 
Similarly the pedestrian door to the garage was not replaced. 
At the rear of the house, a double-hung window was installed in lieu of a casement window 
and two pairs of clear-view picture windows were installed in lieu of double-hung windows.  
The siding at a small bay windows was not installed, instead wood trim covers the bay. 
At the right side of the house, several windows, that were not replaced, were 
misrepresented on the architectural drawings. The triple double-hung window that was 
installed, matches the approved drawings. 
Ordinance Compliance: 
There are no conflicts between the proposed project and the City of Mission Hills Code of 
Ordinances.

Chris & Molly Tarpey 
2700 West 63rd Street 
The Tarpeys are proposing a new lap pool in their rear yard. 
The proposed project is a substantial construction matter and was noticed as such. 
Summary of Property: 
• 
Character Area: 
Neighborhood Estates 
• 
Location of Common Green Space: Front 
• 
Any Special Frontages: 
None 
Summary of Project: 
The proposed pool is limited to 214 square feet and is located in the northwest corner of the 
property.  There is no proposal for a deck around the pool.  It is connected to an existing patio via a 
stepping stone walkway.  The pool is level to the ground and no grading is proposed. 
A large walkway and a two small patios are to be removed as part of the project.  After the 
Tarpeys discovered that their project did not meet the greenspace recommendation, they 
decided to remove a portion of their driveway as part of the project which will add 136 sq. ft. 
of greenspace.  This changed their proposed greenspace to 56.5%. 
Impervious Surface Calculations: 
Total Lot Area: 
23,052 SF 
Existing House Footprint: 
4,665 SF 
Existing Driveway: 
5,011 SF 
Proposed pool & walkway: 
355 SF 
Remaining Greenspace: 
13,021 SF 
Ordinance Compliance: 
There are no conflicts between the proposed project and the City’s Code of Ordinances. 
Design Guideline Review: 
The design guideline supplement adopted on March 9, 2020 recommends that LS-3 lot maintain a 
minimum greenspace area no less than 65% of the total lot area. For this lot, an area of 14,984 SF 
should be maintained.  As proposed, only 12,940 SF are provided.  This recommendation has 
not been met.  Please note, the removed patios, walkway, and driveway add 636 SF of 
greenspace back to the project.  After the pool addition, there will still be a net addition of 281 SF 
of greenspace over the existing conditions.

Paul Reicherter & Jessica Jellison 
6716 Cherokee Lane 
The Reicherter-Jellisons are proposing a new 2-story home with a 5,091 sq. ft. footprint.  The 
footprint consists of 2,875 sq. ft. of first floor space, a 1,200 sq. ft. 4-car garage, and 1,016 sq. ft. of 
covered porches. An additional 2,875 sq. ft. are proposed on the second floor. The project includes 
a circle driveway and full tennis court. 
The proposed project is a substantial construction matter and was noticed as such.  The project 
was continued at the May 12th meeting so that revised drawings could be reviewed by the 
Professional Review Panel.  Those drawings have not been submitted. 
Summary of Property: 
• 
Character Area: 
Neighborhood Estates 
• 
Location of Common Green Space: Front 
• 
Any Special Frontages: 
None 
Summary of Project: 
The main mass of the house is two-stories using a horizontal massing style. The main mass is 
flanked on the left by a single-story wing.  The garage is part of the main house as it is under the 
same primary roof structure; however, a breezeway separates the garage from the house.  The 
house is sided primarily with lap siding.  Field stone is being indicated for inset areas and exposed 
foundations. Due to the slope of the property, a large amount of the rear foundation is exposed. 
The new first floor elevation is approximately the same as the previous house.  The main floor sits 
approximately 2 feet lower than the home to the right and approximately 6 inches higher than the 
home to the left.  The main ridge is approximately 2 feet higher than the home to the right and 
approximately 2 feet higher than the home to the left.  Both adjacent homes are also 2-story with 
comparable eave lines. 
Windows are a combination of fixed and casements, all with minimal muntin bars.  At the front of 
the house, windows stack from the first to second floor.  The window arrangement remains fairly 
formal at the sides and rear.  All of the windows have extensive trim including cast stone sills at 
windows in walls clad with stone. 
The roof is standing seam with most having a 9/12 pitch. An eyebrow roof is proposed at the 
second floor line. These roofs will have a 4/12 pitch. 
A concrete driveway is proposed at 12 feet wide at the entrance and does not significantly widen 
near the house.  The internal green spaces is 80 feet wide and 40 feet deep. 
At the rear of the house, a large sport court is proposed.  A stone clad retaining wall will encircle 
the entire court to create a level playing area.  Please note, the sport court encroaches into the 
floodplain so KDHE and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be required to review the project. 
The AC Units and generator are proposed at the right (north) side of the house.  No enclosure, 
other than topography, is proposed. 
 
June 9, 2020 
Ordinance Compliance: 
There are no conflicts between the proposed project and the City of Mission Hills Code of 
Ordinances. 
Design Guideline Review: 
Section 2.3 on pages 64 through 67 of the Design Guidelines provides specific recommendations 
for the Neighborhood Estates character area. 
Subsection A suggests that the main mass of the house should be between 40% and 50% of the 
lot width.  At 95’-10” feet wide (64%), the main mass is wider than recommended, however this is 
not uncommon with horizontal massing styles because the side wings are incorporated into the 
main mass, the ARB might find this acceptable.  This section goes on to suggest that the depth of 
the main mass should be 25% of the lot width.  This recommendation has been met. 
Subsection B suggests that front wings have a width clearly less than the main mass with the total 
of all wings being less than 50% of the main mass width.  This recommendation has been met. 
Subsection G recommends that circle driveways have a minimum of 80 feet between curb cuts and 
the interior green should be no less than 40 feet deep.  This recommendation has been met. 
Section 2.6.4 on page 89 of the Design Guidelines provides recommendations for lot coverage.  
The section suggests that lot coverage be limited and should not exceed an increase of 50% over 
the average percentage maximum lot coverage that is being used by the neighboring properties.  
This recommendation has been met.   
Section 2.7.2 A on page 101 recommends garages be set behind the façade of the main house 
mass.  This recommendation has not been met. 
Additions to the Design Guidelines, adopted on March 9, 2020, recommend that LS-5 properties 
have a minimum of 65% greenspace.  As proposed, only 57% greenspace has been provided.  
This recommendation has not been met. 
PRP Recommendation: 
The Professional Review Panel has not yet completed their review.
