 to Contract
#CO004282,
 Agreement between Anoka
 County and
 First

 for
Operation of Anoka

 Tliis
amendment
 wit/  extend  the  contract
 through
 Aprif  30, 2021  and  will  be
retroactive
 to February  1, 2020.
BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS  ACTION
TAKEN
Anoka  County  entered
 into  agreement
 with  First  Transit  in 2015  to operate
Transit Link Service.
 The
 program is
 funded through an
 agreement with the
Metropolitan
 Council  and  was  originally
 set  to end  July  31, 2020.
The
 Metropolitan  Council
 approached First Transit to take
 in
 a
 failed
contract
 unrelated
 to Anoka  County.  
This added  contract
 pays  the drivers
more  than  the  current
 Anoka  County  contmct
 so the  Amendment
 will  bring
the
 minimum pay to the same
 level.
 
This
 will prevent drivers from
transitioning  away from Anoka County
 Travefer routes to the more lucrative
routes.  
Both  contracts
 will  now  terminate
 April  30'h and  will  be procured
together
 by the  Metropolitan
 Council  to start  May  1,  2021.
The
 increased wages
 will be
 covered with Metropolitan  Council
 funds.

Background  / Analysis
The City  of Coon Rapids  has proposed
 a
 pedestrian
 bridge  over  Coon Rapids  Boulevard.  
Last year  the  City  requested
the  County  financially
 participate
 as
 it was along  a
 portion  of  the  Coon  Creek  Regional  Trail. 
Opting  not  to financially
participate,
 the  County  did agree  to amend  the  Coon Creek  Regional  Trail  Master  Plan to include  the city  proposed
pedestrian
 bridge  but  reaffirmed
 the  County  would  not  participate
 financially.
Parks  staff  have drafted  an
 amendment
 to master  plan that  includes  the  proposed  pedestrian
 bridge  and received  a
Resolution
 of  Support  from  the  City  on the  amendment.
 
To complete
 the  approval  process,  the  County  is
 required
 to
submit  a
 
Resolution
 
of Support  for  the amendment.
 
Once the 
Resolution
 
is
 approved,
 the  Amendment
 will 
be
forwarded
 on to  the  Met  Council  for  their  review  and approval.

guidance.
