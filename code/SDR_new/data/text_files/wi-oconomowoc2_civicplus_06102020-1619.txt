2. Approve the March 11, 2020 Minutes:  Motion by Flint to approve the March 11, 2020 minutes; second by 
Krogstad.  Motion carried 4-0. 
 
3. Pabst Farms Apartments – Consider/approve Building Plans to be located on the north side of Valley 
Road directly across from Gold Medal Drive:  Weber explained the applicant originally had their initial building 
plans reviewed by the Architectural Commission in October 2019. The parcel consists of 34 acres and the 
development will consist of 302 apartments in a mix of 14 and 18 unit buildings and townhomes. She showed 
pictures of the previous submittal from the initial concept plan and said there are a couple of issues with the new 
plans.  The new 18 unit buildings reflect a long expansive 166’ roofline. The applicant, Emily Cialdini of the 
Mandel Group provided 3 options for the roofline and handed out updated copies of the proposed rooflines and 
clubhouse.  Weber also noted the townhomes are shown with 2 different side elevations and preferred the side 
with the door to face Valley Road if possible.  The plans also show a set of 4 single loaded detached garages 
along the west elevation, and Weber would prefer that some landscaping be added along the back side to help 
break up the expansive wall.  She suggested the use of evergreens. Weber then showed the updated plan for the 
clubhouse, noting the roof now consists of dimensional shingles, the entry feature has been reduced and the 
windows have been changed. The HVAC units will be on the ground near each building, and Weber requested 
that any rooftop venting either be screened or minimized and colored to match surrounding materials. She 
recommended approval with conditions as listed in the background. Cialdini explained the door shown on the 
townhomes is the entrance for water service deliveries, however a faux door could be added if the members 
prefer. They will also add evergreens along the rear elevation of the detached single-loaded garages. Clubhouse 
changes include dimensional roof shingles; removal of one window on the front elevation; and eliminating the 
transoms and lowering the ceilings because there is mechanical equipment in that section now.  Cialdini provided 
color samples and materials for the members to review and distributed proposed branding for the complex which 
ties it to Pabst Farms. She said they went away with the black and white color combinations and larger stone 
sections on the buildings and instead they will be mostly white with the stone relocated along the base. Cialdini 
said they plan to use the same amount of stone but now it will be throughout the development.  Members 
questioned roof color; are concerned with the roofline of the detached garages; stone is minimized and the gray is 
missing from the previous submittal; colors are almost simplistic – concerned it will not look good in the future; and 
the stone base helps with splash up onto the white board and baton siding. They suggested using carriage style 
doors with black hardware and side lights for the garage doors; adding a gable on the detached garages and 
putting two dormers on one side of the long roof elevation and then alternate with two dormers on the other side. 
Ian Martin of the Mandel Group explained the “white” color will actually be a dirty white and they have 
maintenance teams who take care of their properties. He said adding hardware to the garage doors is a great 
solution and they will have to review dormers on the detached garages to make sure it makes sense. Cialdini 
added they had been considered a wood tone for the garage doors and will do research on the proposed carriage 
style doors. Members said the buildings have a very clean look; felt the design overall is well done; it’s a nice 
looking building; and would like them to also consider the proposed carriage style garage doors for the town 
homes. Motion by Schultz to approve the building plans for the Pabst Farms Apartments with the following: 
change the long expansive roofline on the (18) unit building to Option A; add evergreens along the back side of 
the detached garages on the west elevation along with the addition of dormers alternating placement on the front 
S:Clerk\Committees-Commissions\Architectural\2020\ACMin 5-13-20 
and rear elevations; approve the clubhouse as submitted; and change the garage doors to a carriage style design; 
with all changes to be reviewed and approved by Planning Staff; second by Krogstad.  Motion carried 4-0. 
 
4. Reports and comments from the City Planner:  None. 
 
5. Reports and comments from the Architectural Commissioners:  None. 
 
6. Adjourn:  Motion by Schultz to adjourn at 6:10 pm; second by Flint.  Motion carried 4-0.

Item #3 – Valvoline; Master Sign Plan Update 
The applicant is requesting approval to update the Master Sign Plan located at 1111 Summit 
Avenue.  This Valvoline building is under the Master Sign Plan for Whitman Park that was reviewed 
and approved by the Architectural Commission on January 9th 2019.   
 
The applicant would like to update the Master Sign Plan to allow the business to replace the existing 
wall signage and add a ground sign with an Electronic Messaging Center (EMC). 
 
Wall Signs 
Replace (3) existing wall signs with new sign faces.  The size will stay the same and will not increase.  
Planning Staff supports the face replacement of the wall signs. 
 
Sign Design / Electronic Messaging Center (EMC)  
The applicant is requesting a digital reader board.  Per Section §17.609(1)(a) of the City Code, the 
EMC “shall not exceed 25% of the total sign area…” The application is requesting approval of an EMC 
that is (28.5” x 57”/144 = 11.28 SF). The sign design has lots of ins and outs and the measurements 
is subjective.  Planning Staff came to an understanding that the total sign area is 129” x 60”/144 = 
53.75 SF, so the EMC is 20.9% of the overall sign.  The total sign area is 3.75 SF larger than the 
Code allows. Staff supports the size and proportion of the overall design and EMC.  Commissioners 
to determine if the sign is sized proportionately.   
 
Sign Delta  
The applicant shows the sign at the maximum height of (8’) to meet City Ordinance.  Following the 
process established by the Architectural Commission for a property adjacent to the recently raised 
WIS 67 (maximum height of 8’ above the grade of WIS 67 at curb) the Applicant may decide to 
investigate the road elevation of the WIS 67 at the curb.  If they prove there is a height difference 
and want to increase the height, Planning Staff requests administrative approval from the 
Commissioners to increase the ground sign height. 
 
Recommendation:   
Approve the Master Sign Plan Update for Valvoline, located at 1111 Summit Avenue, with the 
following considerations: 
• 
Sign Design / EMC: Commissioners to determine if the sign is sized accordingly. 
 
Additional Logistics: 
• 
If any changes occur to the Master Sign Plan: The applicant must provide an updated copy of the 
approved MSP, prior to Zoning Approval on the sign permit. 
• 
Sign Permit Required: Pending approval of the Master Sign Plan, the applicant can apply for (4) 
sign permits from the Building Inspection Department located on the second floor of City Hall. 
• 
A Call Diggers Hotline is Required: Dial 811.

Item #4 – 20 S. Main Street; Master Sign Plan  
The applicant is requesting approval for a Master Sign Plan located at 20 S. Main Street.  Per Section 
§17.609(3)(a) of the City’s Municipal Code, multi-tenant buildings are required to submit a 
coordinated master sign plan to the Architectural Commission for approval.   This building has (1) 
commercial tenant (Gordy’s) on the first floor with offices on the second.  20 S. Main Street had 
received building approval at the September 11th 2019 Architectural Commission.   
 
Projecting Signs §17.607(3) 
The application shows (2) two projecting signs along S. Main Street.  One (1) for the first floor tenant 
(Gordy’s) and (1) one for the second floor tenant that has the lease space along S. Main Street.  The other 
remaining tenants will not have exterior signage but may have signage inside the tenant entranceway.  
Planning Staff supports this approach.   
 
Sidewalk Clearance §17.607(3) 
Per Code, “The bottom edge of the projecting sign shall be mounted to provide a minimum clearance 
zone of 8’ between the sign and the ground elevation. “   The sidewalk under the projecting signs is 
sloped.  The Applicant provided a visual of the 8’ clearance height.  Planning Staff supports the 
projecting signs location and clearance height.   
 
Cobalt Boats / Everglades Signs  
The Cobalt Boats / Everglades signs considered product signage.  Planning Staff discourages 
specific brand names / products on the building.  Alternatively, Downtown businesses tend to place 
them as window signage, as window signage is unregulated.  The applicant is a special exception 
for these signs as they are a part of their branding for their business. This would be an additional 18 
SF (9 SF each) of signage on the S. Main and Campus Parking Lot elevations. Commissioners to 
determine if the special exception is warranted.   
 
Note Pending approval of the Master Sign Plan, the applicant can apply for a sign permit from 
Building Inspection (262-569-2195) located on the second floor of City Hall. Each sign permit is $50. 
 
Recommendation:   
Approve the Master Sign Plan for 20 S. Main Street, with the following considerations: 
• 
Cobalt Boats / Everglades Signs: Commissioners to determine if the special exception is 
warranted.  
 
Additional Logistics: 
• 
If any changes occur to the Master Sign Plan: The applicant must provide an updated copy of the 
approved MSP, prior to Zoning Approval on the sign permit. 
• 
Sign Permit Required: Pending approval of the Master Sign Plan, the applicant can apply for sign 
permits from the Building Inspection Department located on the second floor of City Hall.

Item #5 – The Marketplace; Façade Update  
The applicant is requesting approval for a façade update located at 130, 132 & 134 E. Wisconsin 
Avenue (the former May’s Garden Center).     Initially it was a multi-tenant building, then was May’s 
Garden Center (single tenant), and the new Property Owner is bringing it back to multi-tenant and 
branding the building “The Marketplace.”   
 
The building will be re-tuckpointed, painted a soft gray with black trim, and some new windows, 
entry doors and a garage door will be installed.   
 
Building Colors 
The application states Sherwin Williams paint colors Gypsum (SW9543) for accent locations, Guild 
Grey (SW9561) for the main building color, Rock Bottom (SW7062) for the trim.  Planning Staff spoke 
with the Applicant about painting the building and the regular maintenance involved once you 
paint brick.  The Applicant acknowledges the change and wants to bring a fresh appearance to a 
long-time Downtown building.  Planning Staff supports the new building colors.  Applicant to bring 
color samples to the meeting. 
 
Windows 
The Applicant will be replacing a few of the Wisconsin Avenue façade windows with the same 
design and mullion system just with tempered glass.  The Applicant is also opening up the boarded 
up windows along the fun walkway.  Planning Staff feels this will be a great opportunity for the 
tenants to display their merchandise as well as an enhancing the pedestrian experience along the 
walkway. 
 
Awning/Canopy 
The previous roll up/out awning canvas will be updated to black and white to compliment the white 
façade.  Planning Staffing supports this update. 
 
The Marketplace Sign 
The Wisconsin Avenue façade has an inset of 15’ long, 3’ in height and 8” deep.  This was the location 
May’s Garden Center sign.  The Applicant is proposing a new sign in this location to brand the 
building “The Marketplace.”  The sign would also be lit.  The applicant wants a simple white light 
(no colors) and mentioned he was researching several options.  Applicant to provide additional 
information to the meeting.   
 
Building Lighting 
The applicant is also updating the building lighting along Wisconsin Avenue and on the Fowler Lake 
façade.  The applicant is proposing gooseneck along Wisconsin Avenue and coach style on the 
Fowler Lake façade.   
 
Fowler Lake Façade 
The Fowler Lake elevation, historically, was utilized as a back of a building and a loading zone.  The 
proposed façade update will reactivate this elevation by installing new tenant doors, windows and 
a new clear-glass garage door.  The storage shed will also be removed allowing for greater visibility 
from the parking lot and Boardwalk.  At this time the consolidated dumpster will remain, until an 
alternative location is identified.  Planning Staff supports the façade enhancements and is excited 
about activating this elevation to become more welcoming to the Downtown patrons.  
 
Architectural Commission Meeting Background 
June 10th, 2020 – Page 4 
 
Note Per Section §17.609(3)(a) of the City’s Municipal Code, multi-tenant buildings are required to 
submit a coordinated master sign plan to the Architectural Commission for approval.  At this time,

Item #6 – City of Oconomowoc Police Department; Signage Special Exception  
The applicant is requesting approval for a special exception for signage future police station / public 
safety facility located at 630 E. Wisconsin Avenue.  The Architectural Commission approved the building 
update at the July 10th 2019 Architectural Commission meeting.   At that time, wall signage was shown 
but no signage review and approval was requested.  Now the applicant has sign specifications and is 
requesting review and approval of the wall sign. 
 
Overall Size §17.607(1) & §17.608(2)(c)(2)

legible from the road.  Due to the use of the building as a police station / public safety building, people 
should be able to identify the building quickly and efficiently as possible.  Planning Staff supports the 
justification for the special exception.  Commissioner to determine if the special exception is warranted.
