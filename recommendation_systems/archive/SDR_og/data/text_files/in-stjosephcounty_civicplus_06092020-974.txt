Petitioner: 
 
TIM MARTSOLF 
Location: 
 
NW Corner of Beech and Third 
Jurisdiction: 
 
Town of Osceola 
Public Hearing Date: 3/17/2020 
Requested Action: 
The petitioner is requesting a zone change from C Commercial District to I Industrial 
District 
Land Uses and Zoning: 
On site: 
On site is a vacant lot. 
North: 
Railroad tracks, AEP power lines, and commercial properties zoned C: 
Commercial District. 
East: 
Commercial use property zoned C: Commercial District; single family 
home zoned C: Commercial District; and a single family homes zoned R1: 
Single Family District. 
South: 
Industrial use property zoned I: Industrial District; commercial use 
property zoned C: Commercial District; and single family home zoned C: 
Commercial District. 
West: 
Self-storage facility zoned I: Industrial District. 
District Uses and Development Standards: 
The I Industrial District is established to provide for development of 
office/warehouse/distribution, wholesale, assembly and manufacturing or processing 
facilities which transform previously manufactured or blended materials or substances 
into new products or into a useable form. Permitted uses in this district tend to generate 
heavy traffic, require extensive community facilities, require outdoor storage and 
generate varying amounts of hazardous or objectionable elements such as noise, odor, 
dust, smoke or glare. 
Site Plan Description: 
The site plan shows the construction of a manufacturing building of 36,000 square feet, a 
future building expansion of 2,400 square feet, proposed pavement of 63,000 square feet 
for 90 total parking spaces, a bike rack for 18 bicycles, foundation landscaping, parking 
screening hedge, shade trees at 100 feet spacing, etc. 
Zoning and Land Use History and Trends: 
Site is zoned I: Industrial District on the west and C: Commercial District on the east. 
Traffic and Transportation Considerations: 
Beech and Third Street are each two lanes. 
Utilities: 
The site will be served by well and septic. 
Agency Comments: 
Engineering: Per Section 8.05 (D) of the Town of Osceola Zoning Ordinance, “All such 
off-street parking areas shall include at least one (1) required interior landscape island for 
every ten (10) parking spaces (or fraction thereof)”. On the south side of the building, the 
Staff Report 
 
3/12/20 
APC# 2922-20 
 
Page 2 of 3 
interior parking spaces have two landscape islands on either end of the row of 29 parking 
spaces. Interior landscape islands shall be added at the correct 
spacing in this row per the ordinance described above. 
Health Department: New commercial septic system and new commercial water supply 
well are needed. Applications have not yet been received. The proposed well location 
does not meet setbacks required under State and/or County Code. The septic location may 
need to be altered depending on sizing requirements issued by Indiana State Department 
of Health. Approval recommended for rezoning ONLY. Site plan will need to be altered 
for final septic and well locations. 
Surveyor: Recommends approval. 
Commitments: 
The petitioner is not proposing any written commitments. 
Criteria to be considered in reviewing rezoning requests, per IC 36-7-4-603: 
1. Comprehensive Plan: 
Policy Plan: 
Town of Osceola Comprehensive Plan (1992), Part IV Comprehensive Plan, "B. 
Summary of Development Opportunities and Constraints" notes the community's intent 
that "new light industrial parks should be planned for." 
Land Use Plan: 
The Town of Osceola Land Use Plan map of the Comprehensive Plan (1992) does not 
make any determination what the subject property should be used for in the future. 
However, the text in the Land Use Plan states that industrial use is desired "on the south 
side of Osceola near the Conrail line, east of Beach Road." This is were the subject 
property is. 
Plan Implementation/Other Plans: 
No other plans have been approved for this area. 
2. Current Conditions and Character: 
Current condition and character of current structures and uses in the I Industrial District 
match the proposed use. 
3. Most Desirable Use: 
The most desirable use of this property is to continue the light industrial park use along 
Third Street and one that limits the impact on surrounding residential properties. 
4. Conservation of Property Values: 
With proper landscaping screening, surrounding property values should not be adversely 
affected. 
5. Responsible Development and Growth: 
It is responsible development and growth to keep light industrial use adjacent to other 
light industrial use along Third Street. 
Combined Public Hearing 
The petitioner is seeking the following variance(s): 
1) from the maximum height for a fence between the front lot line and the front building 
line of 4’ to 8’ 
2) to allow a barbed wire fence between the front lot line and the building line 
Staff Report

APC# 2922-20 
 
Page 3 of 3 
3) from the required hard surface to gravel for parking areas 
State statutes and the Zoning Ordinance require that certain standards must be met before 
a variance can be approved. The standards and their justifications are as follows: 
(1) The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals and 
general welfare of the community; 
The approval of the variances will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals and 
general welfare of the community, because the proposed fencing and gravel do not pose 
serious concerns for the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the 
community. 
(2) The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance 
will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner; 
The use and value of adjacent property will not be adversely affected by the approval of 
the variances, because the gravel parking area is of suitable distance to allow amble 
settling of dust before it could reach residential uses and the fencing matches the 
character of the area. 
(3) The strict application of the terms of this Chapter would result in practical 
difficulties in the use of the property 
The strict application of this ordinance would cause practical difficulties in utilizing this 
site, because of the needs for the industrial use require additional fencing beyond normal 
for security considerations and the size of this property allows enough distance for gravel 
dust to settle before getting to residential uses. 
Staff Comments: 
The staff has no additional comments at this time. 
Recommendation: 
Based on the information available prior to the public hearing, the staff recommends 
sending this rezoning to the County Council with a favorable recommendation. The staff 
recommends approval of the variances. 
Analysis: 
Industrial use of the subject property is consistent with the text of the 1992 
Comprehensive Plan's future land use section.

THOMAS E LAWSON 
Location: 
 
501 W MICHIGAN ST 
Jurisdiction: 
 
Town of New Carlisle 
Public Hearing Date: 3/17/2020 
Requested Action: 
The petitioner is requesting a zone change from R1 Single Family District to LB Local 
Business District 
Land Uses and Zoning: 
On site: 
Auto repair shop. 
North: 
Homes zoned R1 Single Family District. 
East: 
Homes zoned MF Multifamily District. 
South: 
Homes zoned R1 Single Family District. 
West: 
Businesses zoned LB - Local Business District. 
District Uses and Development Standards: 
The LB - Local Business District is established to provide for small businesses located 
outside of the town center and which provide for the full range of convenience uses 
necessary to meet the daily needs of nearby residential neighborhoods. Permitted uses 
within the LB Districts are regulated in character to assure harmonious development with 
the nearby Residential Districts served and are limited in size and scale to promote 
pedestrian access and neighborhood use. 
Site Plan Description: 
No site plan provided. 
Zoning and Land Use History and Trends: 
Subject property was reportedly missed during the last time the zoning map was updated. 
Requested action set to correct that apparent oversight. 
Traffic and Transportation Considerations: 
US Route 20 Lincoln Highway is two lanes with substantial shoulders. Meridian Street is 
two lanes. 
Utilities: 
Subject property is served by municipal water and sewer service. 
Agency Comments: 
Engineering: No comments/issues regarding the requested change to LB. 
Health Department: Recommends the application be approved. The property was used 
as a car dealership from 1949-1984 and as an auto service center from 1984-Present.  The 
rezoning is needed for sale of property. Site remediation may be required depending on 
future uses. 
Surveyor: Recommends approval. 
Commitments: 
The petitioner is not proposing any written commitments. 
Criteria to be considered in reviewing rezoning requests, per IC 36-7-4-603:

Page 2 of 3 
The proposed commercial use is consistent with the Town of New Carlisle 
Comprehensive Plan (2007) Achieving Quality Growth Goal, Objective 1 - Commercial 
Growth, "New commercial growth should meet a broad variety of the retail and service 
needs of residents in buildings of modest scale, consistent with the small-town scale of 
existing development, and concentrated in commercial clusters shown on the Future Land 
Use Plan." 
Land Use Plan: 
The Town of New Carlisle Comprehensive Plan (2007) shows the subject property as 
local business on the existing land use map; however, the proposed (future) land use map 
shows it as residential - reportedly an unintended oversight. 
Plan Implementation/Other Plans: 
No other land use plans have been approved for this area. 
2. Current Conditions and Character: 
Current condition and character of current structure and use is consistent with the Local 
Business District. 
3. Most Desirable Use: 
Continued use of subject property as a local business is the most desirable use for this 
location along US Route 20. 
4. Conservation of Property Values: 
As this is the continuation of a long standing existing use, property values should remain 
largely unaffected. 
5. Responsible Development and Growth: 
Making use of an existing building designed for business use at the edge of other local 
businesses and along US Route 20 represents responsible development and growth by 
continuing its use. 
Combined Public Hearing 
The petitioner is seeking the following variance(s): 
1) from the minimum required front yard setback of 25’ to 14’ 
2) from the minimum required side yard setback of 10’ to 0’ 
3) from the minimum rear residential bufferyard setback of 20’ to 7’ 
4) from the required hard surface to gravel for parking areas 
State statutes and the Zoning Ordinance require that certain standards must be met before 
a variance can be approved. The standards and their justifications are as follows: 
(1) The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals and 
general welfare of the community; 
The approval of the variances will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals and 
general welfare of the community, because it is a continuation of the existing use. 
(2) The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance 
will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner; 
The use and value of adjacent property will not be adversely affected by the approval of 
the variances, because the use is long standing and no change is being proposed, this will 
keep the character of the area the same.

(3) The strict application of the terms of this Chapter would result in practical 
difficulties in the use of the property 
The strict application of this ordinance would cause practical difficulties in utilizing this 
site, because this is already an existing building which does not meet current 
development standards. Strict application would require the demolition of a section of 
building which could otherwise continue to be used. 
Staff Comments: 
The staff has no additional comments at this time. 
Recommendation: 
Based on the information available prior to the public hearing, the staff recommends 
sending this rezoning to the County Council with a favorable recommendation. The staff 
recommends approval of the variances. 
Analysis: 
Existing use as a local business in this location is consistent with Comprehensive Plan 
(2007) Achieving Quality Growth Goal, Commercial Growth Objective 1. It takes 
advantage of the existing building use and investment.

    3). From the requirement of foundation landscaping for the proposed maintenance building to no landscaping. 
    4). From the requirement of a minmium of 200 ft. linear spacing for a Outdoor Advertising sign from a 
          residential district to a minimum of 90 feet and from the required minimum 100 ft. radial spacing for a 
         Outdoor Advertising sign from a residential district to a minimum of 90 ft.           
    5). From the requirement of providing a minimum of one (1) loading dock for Parcel "A'  to no loading dock.  
           
 
2) A statement on how each of the following standards for the granting of variances is met: 
 
(a) The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the 
community:   The request for not having a Type 2 Landscape along the north and east property lines is 
due to the fact that the adjacent property is proposed to have future development have will require a 
commercial zoning classification. The development is being done with PHM School corp. which is also a 
petitioner for this project. Residential development is not going to happen on the PHM property. There is 
not a need for the intense screening requirement. The request for no off-street parking area screening 
along the east line of the parking bay which is adjacent to the PHM property is for the same reasoning as 
the first variance request, since the adjacent property will be developed for a commercial use and is 
owned by one of the petitioners for this request. There will be landscaping placed along the front of the 
parking bay as shown. The request for no foundation landscaping for the future Maintenance building is 
due to the proposed use and location of the structure. The building is utilitarian in nature and not used by 
the public. It is also located behind the fire station facility and not in direct view from the street. There is 
a landscape screen in front of the parking area which will provide a buffer between the building and the 
the street.  The request for no loading dock is because the proposed use is a Fire Station which does not 
have deliveries that require a loading dock. The variances for the Outdoor Advertising sign are just to 
move an existing sign to the east of its present location to remove any conflict with the fire station 
building.  
 
 
 
(b) The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a 
substantially adverse manner; and:  This area has a mix of uses from residential to industrial in nature. 
The proposed fire station facility will be a benefit to the area and will allow for protection of the 
surrounding industrial, commercial and residential uses. This proposed use should not have a detrimental 
affect on surrounding properties. 
 
(c) The strict application of the terms of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties in the use of the 
property:  The ordinance would require additonal screening where none is needed due to the existing 
land uses adjacent to the site and proposed uses for this area. The intent of the ordinance was to create a 
buffer from higher intense uses and residential uses. The petitioner has complete control over the 
adjacent vacant land that is zoned residential, and no homes will be built on the property. 
 
 
 
 
 
IF A SPECIAL USE IS BEING REQUESTED, (if not, please skip to next section):   
1)  The Special Use(s) being requested :  N/A 
     
 
2)  A statement on how each of the following standards for the granting of a Special Use is met: 
 
(a)  The proposed use will not be injurious to the public health, safety, comfort, community moral standards, 
convenience or general welfare:      
 
(b)  The proposed use will not injure or adversely affect the use of the adjacent area or property values 
therein:        
 
(c) The proposed use will be consistent with the character of the district in which it is located and the land 
uses authorized therein; and:    
 
(d) The proposed use is compatible with the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan.
