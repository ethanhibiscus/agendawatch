EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:   The rezoning of the planned development district to MFR-14 is needed 
to establish district regulations for this proposed apartment complex. A prior city council created 
several PD zones in the city to identify areas deemed appropriate for flexible standards. No 
district regulations were established at that time so each of the PD tracts must be rezoned to 
provide such. In making a determination regarding a requested zoning change, the planning and 
zoning commission and the city council shall consider the following factors: Whether the uses 
permitted by the proposed change will be appropriate in the immediate area concerned, and 
their relationship to the general area and to the city as a whole. Whether the proposed change 
is in accord with any existing or proposed plans for providing public schools, streets, water supply, 
sanitary sewers, and other utilities to the area. The amount of vacant land currently classified for 
similar development in the vicinity and elsewhere in the city, and any special circumstances which 
may make a substantial part of such vacant land unavailable for development. The recent rate at 
which land is being developed in the same zoning classification as the request, particularly in the 
vicinity of the proposed change. How other areas designated for similar development will be, or 
are likely to be, affected if the proposed amendment is approved. Any other factors that will 
substantially affect the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. 
The Planning and Zoning Commission recommended approval on June 4, 2020.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:    
Purpose 
The purpose of the PID is to assist the developer with public infrastructure costs.  Through the 
PID, the developer will recover certain costs through an assessment on each lot.  This 
arrangement is similar to a municipal utility district (MUD) and the MUD tax used for the same 
purpose.   
 
Assessment Rate 
The PID assessment is expected to be approximately $987 per lot per year, or the equivalent of 
a 34-cent tax rate on a $290,000 home.  Included in the annual payment are financing and 
interest costs allowing for a level annual payment over the proposed thirty (30) year term of the 
PID.  For planning purposes, the principal amount for each lot equals $17,597.46 and the interest 
rate on financed assessments is 3.75%.  The principal amount of the assessment will be payable 
2 
 
at any time by the homeowners which would terminate the assessment, and an amortization 
schedule will be kept for each property covered by the assessment to track annual payments and 
the outstanding principal balance.      
 
Disclosure 
Proper disclosure notices detailing the assessment will be presented to potential homebuyers by 
the builders, and for acknowledgement at closing in the same manner as disclosure notices used 
in MUDs and other special districts with an ad valorem tax rate. 
 
Future Actions 
If created, the PID would still need City Council approval of the Service and Assessment Plan and 
all Assessment Rolls (i.e. no assessments can be implemented without City Council approval). The 
District Administrator will write the Service and Assessment Plans and formulate the Assessment 
Rolls for consideration by City Council. The District Administrator will work with the City and the 
Brazoria County Tax Assessor to have the assessments placed on the County tax bills.  The PID 
assessments will be collected on an annual basis in the same manner as property taxes and 
transferred to a City-established PID revenue fund.

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF 
ANGLETON, TEXAS, APPROVING ISSUANCE UP TO A MAXIMUM 
AMOUNT OF $15,000,000 BRAZOSPORT WATER AUTHORITY SPECIAL 
PROJECT REVENUE BONDS (HARRIS RESERVOIR EXPANSION 
PROJECT), TAXABLE SERIES 2020 AND ANY ADDITIONAL SERIES; 
AND CONTAINING OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT 
 
WHEREAS, the Brazosport Water Authority (the “Authority”) was created by 1985 Tex. Laws, 
Reg. Sess., Ch. 449 at 3063, as amended, under the authority of Article XIV, Section 59 of the 
Texas Constitution, and the boundaries of the Authority have not been in any way changed or 
altered since the enactment of Chapter 449, Acts of the 69th Legislature of Texas, Regular Session, 
1985. The Authority has entered into a take-or-pay water supply contract (the “Contract”), dated 
February 20, 1987, with seven member cities of the Authority, including the City of Angleton (the 
“City”), under the terms of which the cities are collectively obligated to make payments to the 
Authority sufficient to pay the principal and interest requirements on outstanding bonds relating to 
the System (as defined in the Contract), and such Contracts remain in full force and effect; 
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Authority desires to proceed with the 
planning of an expansion of the Harris Reservoir on land adjacent thereto and construction of 
certain other facilities including an intake and pump station to divert existing surface water from 
the Brazos River (the “Special Project”), which improvements constitute Special Project Facilities 
as described in Section 8.4 of the Contract, through the issuance of the Authority’s Special Project 
Revenue Bonds (Harris Reservoir Expansion Project), in one or more series (the “Bonds”), 
beginning with Taxable Series 2020 in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $15,000,000 
under a bond resolution in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (the “Bond 
Resolution”), and has authorized the Authority’s attorneys and financial advisors to take any action 
reasonably necessary to proceed with preparation for the issuance of Bonds for the Special Project; 
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Contract, the City Council finds that the City is not in 
default under the Contract; 
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 8.4 of the Contract, the City Council of the City of Angleton (the 
“City Council”) acknowledges that neither its consent nor its finding that the Special Project is 
necessary and feasible are required because the Special Project consists of Special Project Facilities 
other than improvements to the System for benefit of Participating Customers under the Contract 
(each capitalized term as defined in the Contract); 
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 8.4 of the Contract, the Board of the Authority (i) finds that the 
Special Project is necessary and feasible to serve certain third parties contracting with the 
Authority to purchase treated surface water from the Authority and (ii) agrees that the Special 
Project will be completed with proceeds of the Bonds; 
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.4 of the Contract, the City Council and the Authority agree that 
it is mutually beneficial, but not required, for the City to formally consent to the Special Project 
and issuance of the Bonds;

of its successors and assigns whether or not so expressed.

•
Dow has insufficient stored water to assure the reliable operation of our facilities 
and/or the reliable delivery of stored water to BWA and other local industrial users 
through a serious drought.
•
Dow, BWA and Local Industrial User using Dow Surface Water Supply currently have 
~2 months of reliable local storage; both Dow and the State of Texas have determined 
we need 6 months of local storage.
•
This stored water gap is being managed today with short-term BRA contracts that are 
potentially “at risk” storage supply and will be unavailable in the very near future.

Ask – Enable Dow/BWA Partnering To Access State Funding
•
Dow is requesting that BWA (and member cities) support development of a partnership 
agreement(s) to enable access to financially advantaged TWDB funds to build the reservoir
–
Access to financially advantaged TWDB SWIFT funds is critical to move forward
–
Specifically requesting support for a BWA Board Resolution to enable BWA to….
•
Submit a TWDB SWIFT Fund Application for  a $15 MM Planning Phase Loan  (April 28 Board)
•
Authorize BWA to Negotiate a Design/Construction Partnership Agreement with Dow
•
Anticipated TWDB Funding Plan - Two Step Approach
–
Phase 1 (2020): Up to $15 MM Deferred Planning Phase Loan
–
Phase 2 (2022-2026): Est. $335 MM Subsidized Interest Design/Construction Phase Loan (Targeted 2021 approval)
•
Repayment of Loans 
–
Phase 1 - TWDB Loan Repayment -100% Dow
•
Dow Potable Water Contract will be Amended to Recover Loan Repayment through the Dow Potable Water Price

Why – What’s in this for BWA and Member Cities
•
No rate increase due to this project
•
Enables BWA to increase stored water reserves for the existing 15.7 MGD  surface water 
plant from  60 days to 180 Days 
–
Anticipate that partnering and use of financial advantage funding will provide a $20 MM capital equivalent 
advantage to BWA for securing stored water in the Expand Harris Project 
–
State required 180 days of local BWA storage is expected to be provided at no cost to BWA or BWA member Cities 
(Assume BWA Secures Rosenberg BRA Contract Water)
•
Project protects local industries capability to produce; Supports retention of and/or creation of 
local jobs
•
Zero BWA and Member City risk for supporting planning phase loan;  Dow is committing to 
100% repayment plus costs
•
Design/construction partnering must be developed to be a very clear Win-Win for BWA and 
member cities, as well as for DOW

Memorandum 
To: 
City of Angleton and Concourse Development 
From: 
Stephen Wilcox, P.E., CFM 
Date: 
June 3, 2020 
 
RE: 
City of Angleton and Windrose Green Regional Detention Pond Modifications 
 
 
 
This memorandum is to describe the changes to the regional pond as previously presented in the Drainage Impact 
Analysis dated March 9, 2020 and submitted to the City of Angleton and the Angleton Drainage District (ADD). 
 
Per the discussion in the May 12, 2020 City Council meeting, the city will provide a regional pond within Freedom 
Park that produces a maximum of 98 acre-feet of detention volume in the current 100-year storm event, not the 
Atlas 14 100-yr storm event. A preliminary run of the hydraulic models indicates the 98 acre-feet will mitigate 
the proposed improvements to Henderson Road, the remaining development within Windrose Green, and 
maintain peak water surface elevations along Rancho ditch within the high banks with an average of 1 foot of 
freeboard. The regional pond design assumptions previously discussed with the city (4:1 side slope and a 10-
foot safety shelf) were utilized in this analysis. The surface area of the pond cannot be finalized until the shape 
of the pond is finalized. Once an agreed upon regional pond shape is determined between Concourse 
Development and City Council, the drainage analysis will be updated to reflect the final pond layout and 
resubmitted to the City and ADD.

City of Angleton Council Relations Policy 
 
The City Council for the City of Angleton is dedicated to ethical, efficient and orderly government wherein 
opportunities must be created to allow citizens to have a say in their representative government.  This policy 
addresses both the responsibilities the Council and the responsibilities of the public participating in city 
council meetings, public hearings, committee meetings, and commission meetings. The City of Angleton 
Council Relations Policy is designed to make public meetings and the process of governance run more 
smoothly to benefit all, and to supplement and summarize the Angleton Code of Ordinances Article II City 
Council. 
The integrity of the City of Angleton is built on the interaction between elected officials, City employees, 
and the citizens. The Council Relations Policy is intended to maintain a high level of integrity by providing 
a protocol for how Council members interact with each other, City staff, constituents, and others they 
encounter in representing the City of Angleton. The Council Relations Policy reflects the intentions of the 
Angleton City Council in defining the behaviors, manners, and courtesies that are suitable for various 
occasions. 
The constant and consistent theme through all the conduct guidelines is "respect." Council members 
experience huge workloads and tremendous stress in making decisions that could impact thousands of lives. 
Despite these pressures, elected officials are always called upon to exhibit appropriate behavior. 
Demonstrating respect for each individual through words and actions is the compass that can help guide 
Council members to do the right thing in even the most difficult situations.  This policy sets forth guidelines 
useful for elected officials, city employees, commission and committee members whether appointed or 
voluntary and members of the public including residents of the City of Angleton and those doing business 
here or visiting.

I. 
Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Angleton Elected Officials 
 
The specific responsibilities and duties of the Mayor & City Council are set forth in the Angleton City 
Charter Article III and Angleton Code of Ordinances Chapter 2 Administration, Article II City Council.  
Other resources that are helpful in defining the roles and responsibilities of elected officials can be found 
in the Handbook for Mayors and Council members published by the Texas Municipal League.

be treated with equal respect. 
 
All Council members should:

II. 
Policies and Protocol Related to Conduct for Elected Officials & All Members of the 
Public Interacting with the Elected Officials 
 
The Angleton Mayor-City Council Relations are set forth in Angleton Code of Ordinances 
Chapter 2 Administration, Article II City Council, Subdivision B Integrity Guidelines.  The 
following serves as additional guidance. 
 
Reflecting Council Opinions   
Council members should remember they speak only for themselves and not other Council 
members, however, the Mayor will encourage all council members to participate in the 
discussion by giving each member an opportunity to speak before any member can speak again 
on the same subject. 
 
Ceremonial Events 
Requests for a City representative at ceremonial events will be handled by City staff. The 
Mayor will serve as the designated City representative. If the Mayor is unavailable, then either 
the Mayor Pro Tem or the Mayor’s designee will attend. Invitations received at City Hall are 
presumed to be for unofficial, personal consideration. 
 
E-Mail & Texting Guidelines 
E-mail, and text messaging to a limited degree, has become a familiar form of communication 
between the public and its elected officials. It is important to remember that e-mails and text 
messages held by elected officials regarding their position are a form of public record and must 
be maintained and saved as per the Texas Public Information Act. When a Council member 
receives a personalized e-mail, the Council member should acknowledge the receipt of the e-
mail and concern voiced through a reply e-mail. The response should be polite and careful in 
regard to any personal opinions expressed on the issue. If a reply is sent, the City Manager or 
City Secretary should be copied if there is any further action or official response needed in 
regard to the e-mail.  A current or former City officer or employee who maintains public 
information on a privately owned device (such as a cell phone) is required to either: (1) forward 
or transfer the information to a City server to be preserved according to the City’s records 
control schedule, or (2) preserve the information in its original form in a backup or archive and 
on the privately owned device for the time required by the City’s records control schedule. 
Texas Government Code §552.003. 
 
Correspondence Signatures 
Council members do not need to acknowledge the receipt of correspondence, or copies of 
correspondence, during Council meetings. City staff will prepare official letters in response to 
public inquiries and concerns. These letters will carry the signature of the Mayor unless the 
Mayor requests that they be signed by another Council member or City staff. If correspondence 
is addressed only to one Council member, that Council member should check with staff on the 
best way to respond to the sender. 
 
Public Hearing Protocol 
The applicant or appellant shall have the right to speak first. The Chair will determine the length 
of time allowed for this presentation. Speakers representing either pro or con points of view 
will be allowed to follow. The Chair will determine how much time will be allowed for each 
speaker, with 3 minutes the standard time granted. The applicant or appellant may be allowed 
to make closing comments. The Chair has the responsibility to run an efficient public meeting 
and has the discretion to modify the public hearing process in order to make the meeting run 
smoothly. 
 
 
Council members will not express opinions during the public hearing portion of the meeting 
except to ask pertinent questions of the speaker and staff. "I think" and "I feel" comments by 
Council members are not appropriate until after the close of the public hearing. Council 
members shall refrain from rude and derogatory remarks and shall not cross-examine staff 
members, other council members or members of the public and generally always show respect 
for different points of view. 
 
Open Meetings 
Before an agenda item may be debated, a motion and second must be made, otherwise, the 
agenda item may not be discussed. 
 
Main motions may be followed by amendments, followed by substitute motions. Any 
Councilmember can call for a point of order. Only Council members who voted on the prevailing 
side may make motions to reconsider. 
 
Agenda Development Participation 
Any Council member can request an item be placed on the agenda for future discussion. If possible, 
the request should be made to the City Manager generally two weeks before the meeting, otherwise 
as soon as feasible to satisfy posting requirements. The City Manager will discuss the item with the 
Council member and the Mayor to determine the appropriate placement of the item on the agenda. 
During an open meeting, any Council member may request an item be placed on a future agenda.  
Such item shall be placed on the agenda if a second is made.  No discussion shall be allowed. 
The City Manager may place an item on the agenda without the concurrence of any Council 
member. 
 
III.  
Council Relations with One Another 
 
Councils are composed of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds, personalities, values, 
opinions, and goals. Despite this diversity, all have chosen to serve in public office in order to 
preserve and protect the present and the future of the community. In all cases, this common goal 
should be acknowledged even as Council members may "agree to disagree" on contentious issues. 
 
IN PUBLIC MEETINGS 
Practice civility and decorum in discussions and debate 
 
Difficult questions, tough challenges to a particular point of view, and criticism of ideas and 
information are legitimate elements of a free democracy in action. This does not allow, however, 
Council members to make belligerent, personal, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive, or 
disparaging comments. No shouting or physical actions that could be construed as threatening will 
be tolerated. 
 
Honor the role of the Mayor in maintaining order 
 
It is the responsibility of the Mayor to preserve order and decorum and to keep the comments of 
Council members on track during public meetings. Council members should honor efforts by the 
Mayor to focus discussion on current agenda items. If there is disagreement about the agenda or 
the Mayor's actions, those objections should be voiced politely and with reason, following 
procedures outlined in parliamentary procedure. 
 
 
 
Demonstrate effective problem-solving approaches Council members have a public stage to 
show how individuals with disparate points of view can find common ground and seek a 
compromise that benefits the community as a whole. The Mayor is responsible for keeping the 
meeting professional by recognizing each member for discussion, encouraging debate between 
members, and keeping the discussion on the agenda item being discussed. 
 
IN PRIVATE ENCOUNTERS 
Continue respectful behavior in private 
The same level of respect and consideration of differing points of view deemed appropriate for 
public discussions should be maintained in private conversations. 
 
Be aware of the insecurity of written notes, voicemail messages, and e-mail 
Technology allows words written or said without much forethought to be distributed wide and far. 
Council members should take into consideration that anything sent out via fax, voicemail, texts, e-
mails, social media posts or correspondence could be distributed to the media and citizens. Written 
notes, voicemail messages and e-mail should be treated as potentially "public" communication 
subject to the Texas Public Information Act and require retention by the City Secretary. 
 
Even private conversations can have a public presence 
Elected officials are always on display- their actions, mannerisms, and language are monitored by 
people around them that they may not know. Lunch table conversations will be eavesdropped 
upon, parking lot debates will be watched, and casual comments between individuals before and 
after public meetings noted. 
 
IV.  
Council Relations with City Staff 
 
Governance of a City relies on the cooperative efforts of elected officials, who set policy, and City 
staff who implement and administer the Council's policies. No single relationship is as important 
as that of the council and City Manager in effectively governing the city, and therefore the City 
Manager is the sole link between the council and the professional city staff.  Governance of a 
municipality is a team effort. Cooperation and mutual respect are essential from each individual for 
the good of the community. 
 
Treat all staff as professionals 
Clear, honest communication that respects the abilities, experience, and dignity of each individual 
is expected. Poor behavior towards staff is not acceptable. 
 
Limit contact to specific City staff 
Questions of City staff or requests for additional background information should be directed only 
to the City Manager, City Attorney, City Secretary or Department Directors. The City Manager’s 
Office should be copied on any request, except those to the City Attorney. 
 
Requests for follow-up or directions to staff should be made only through the City Manager or the 
City Attorney when appropriate. When in doubt about what staff contact is appropriate, Council 
members should ask the City Manager for assistance. Materials supplied to a Council member in 
response to a request will be made available to all members of the Council so that all have equal 
access to information. 
 
The Council should strive to avoid involvement in or responding to any staff complaints. Any 
discussions of this nature should be referred directly to the City Manager. The Council should never 
 
speak critically to a member of City staff about other City staff, other Council members, Council 
decisions. 
 
Do not disrupt City staff from their jobs 
Council members should not disrupt City staff while they are in meetings, on the phone, or 
engrossed in performing their job functions in order to have their individual needs met. 
 
Never publicly criticize an individual employee 
Council should never express concerns about the performance of a City employee in public, to the 
employee directly, or to the employee's manager. Comments about staff performance should only 
be made to the City Manager through private correspondence or conversation. 
 
Do not get involved in administrative functions 
Council members must not attempt to influence City staff on the making of appointments, awarding 
of contracts, selecting of consultants, or granting of City licenses and permits.  
 
Check with City staff on correspondence before taking action 
Before sending correspondence, Council members should check with City staff to see if an official 
City response has already been sent or is in progress. 
 
Be selective and careful attending meetings with City staff unless requested by staff 
Even if the Council member does not say anything, the Council member's presence implies support, 
shows partiality, intimidates staff, and hampers staff's ability to do their job objectively. This policy 
does not apply to social functions, such as conferences, etc. 
 
Do not solicit political support from staff 
Council members should not solicit any type of political support (financial contributions, display 
of posters or lawn signs, name on support list, etc.) from City staff. City staff may, as private 
citizens with constitutional rights, support political candidates but all such activities must be done 
away from the workplace. 
 
 
V. 
Council Relations with Citizens 
 
IN PUBLIC MEETINGS 
 
The Angleton City Council welcomes requests, suggestions, and viewpoints of residents of the City 
and considers the responsible presentation of these viewpoints as vital to effective municipal 
government. Council members also recognize their responsibility for proper governance and the 
need to conduct its business in an orderly and effective manner. The Council therefore establishes 
the following procedures to receive citizen input during public meetings. 
 
1. Amount of time allocated 
 
The Mayor will be responsible for recognizing any speakers, maintaining proper order, and 
adhering to any time limit set. Ordinarily, each speaker shall be afforded three minutes in which to 
make their presentation to the Council. Groups of citizens who wish to be heard on the same topic 
should designate a spokesperson when requested to do so by the Mayor.   
 
 
 
 
2. Protocol for addressing the City Council 
 
There shall be a time designated for the City Council to hear from the public at the beginning of 
City Council meetings held at City Hall.  All comments shall be written on a comment card and 
forwarded to the City Secretary either prior to a meeting or at the meeting but before the meeting 
commences.  The Mayor has the right to limit the number of speakers, as well as the amount of 
presentation time allocated to each speaker. If there are a large number of speakers wanting to 
address an issue, the Mayor may request or designate a spokesperson for groups wanting to speak 
with the Council.  As permitted by Texas Government Code §551.007 the City is permitted to limit 
the time permitted to speak, limit all comment by members of the public solely to matters on the 
agenda, and may not prohibit public criticism of the governing body, an omission, policy, 
procedure, program, or service.  Members of the public may not target specific city employees or 
staff members, nor may they criticize city employees.  
 
If an item on the Council agenda for that meeting provides for a public hearing, the person wishing 
to make comments on that item shall speak at the time of the public hearing.  
 
Requests to be heard regarding an item(s) on the regular agenda that does not have a public hearing 
should be made to the City Secretary prior to the start of the meeting. A "request to speak" form, 
provided by the City, requesting to be heard regarding a specific agenda item(s) shall contain the 
citizen's  name, address, telephone number, and subject agenda item(s) number, which the speaker 
wishes to address. The form can be picked up at City Hall or in the Council Chambers and must be 
turned in to the City Secretary prior to the item being addressed. 
 
Speakers shall address the Council from the podium where a microphone ensures that the audience 
can hear the speaker and a record of all comments may be made. If a speaker asks a question during 
the time designated for public comment under this policy, it will be not be answered at this time 
but may be answered during the agenda item. Any comment or discussion by any Council member 
about the subject of the inquiry shall only be made at the time the subject is scheduled for 
consideration on the Council agenda (Texas Government Code §551.042). 
 
3. Protocol for dealing with requests made by citizens 
 
Citizens with specific requests should first discuss them with the City Manager. The Council will 
consider requests that remain unresolved after being addressed through proper administration 
channels. Citizens who attempt to resolve situations at lower levels will be directed to the City 
Manager. 
 
4. Protocol regarding complaints against City personnel 
 
Negative comments regarding City personnel by name or title may not be made in open session 
(due to confidentiality provisions contained in the Texas Open Meetings Act and other state and 
federal laws). Specific complaints regarding municipal employees may be taken up with the 
employee's supervisor or City Manager. 
Disruption of meetings by word or actions of any person may result in removal from the meeting 
by law enforcement officials. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IN UNOFFICIAL SETTINGS 
 
Make no promises on behalf of the Council 
Council members will frequently be asked to explain a Council action or give their opinion about 
an issue as they meet and talk with constituents in the community. It is appropriate to give a brief 
overview of City policy and to refer to City staff for further information. It is inappropriate to 
overtly or implicitly promise Council action, or to promise City staff will do something specific 
(fix a pothole, plant new flowers in the median, etc.). 
 
Make no personal comments about other Council members 
It is acceptable to publicly disagree about an issue, but it is unacceptable to make derogatory 
comments about other Council members, their opinions and actions. 
 
 
Remember that Angleton is a small town 
Council members are constantly being observed by the community every day that they serve in 
office. Their behaviors and comments serve as models for proper behavior in the City of Angleton. 
Honesty and respect for the dignity of each individual should be reflected in every word and action 
taken by Council members, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is a serious and continuous 
responsibility. 
 
VI.  
Council Relations with Other Public Agencies 
 
Be clear about representing the City or personal  interests 
If a Council member appears before another governmental agency or organization to give a 
statement on an issue, the Council member must clearly state: 1) if his or her statement reflects 
personal opinion or is the official stance of the City; 2) whether this is the majority or minority 
opinion of the Council. 
 
If the Council member is representing the City, the Council member must support and advocate 
the official City position on an issue, not a personal viewpoint. 
 
If the Council member is representing another organization whose position is different from the 
City, the Council member should withdraw from voting on the issue if it significantly impacts or 
is detrimental to the City's interest. Council members should be clear about which organizations 
they represent and inform the Mayor and Council of their involvement. 
 
Correspondence also should be equally clear about representation 
City letterhead may be used when the Council member is representing the City and the City's 
official position. A copy of official correspondence should be given to the City Secretary to be filed 
as part of the permanent public record. 
 
City letterhead will not be used for correspondence of Council members representing a personal 
point of view, or a dissenting point of view from an official Council position. 
 
VII. 
Council Relations with Boards and Commissions 
 
The City has established several boards and commissions as a means of gathering more community 
input. Citizens who serve on boards and commissions become more involved in government and 
serve as advisors to the City Council. They are a valuable resource to the City's leadership and 
should be treated with appreciation and respect. 
 
 
If attending a board or commission meeting, be careful to only express personal opinions 
Council members may attend any board or commission meeting, which are always open to any 
member of the public. However, they should be sensitive to the way their participation- especially 
if it is on behalf of an individual, business or developer - could be viewed as unfairly affecting the 
process. Any public comments by a Council member at a board or commission meeting should be 
clearly made as individual opinion and not a representation of the feelings of the entire City 
Council. 
 
Limit contact with board and commission members to questions of clarification 
It is inappropriate for a Council member to contact a board or commission member to lobby on 
behalf of an individual, business, or developer. It is acceptable for Council members to contact 
board or commission members in order to clarify a position taken by the board or commission. 
 
Remember that boards and commissions serve the community, not individual Council 
members 
The City Council appoints individuals to serve on boards and commissions, and it is the 
responsibility of boards and commissions to follow policy established by the Council. But board 
and commission members do not report to individual Council members, nor should Council 
members feel they have the power or right to threaten board and commission members with 
removal if they disagree about an issue. Appointment and re-appointment to a board or commission 
should be based on such criteria as expertise, attendance records, ability to work with staff and the 
public, and commitment to fulfilling official duties. A board or commission appointment should 
not be used as a political "reward." 
 
Be respectful of diverse opinions 
A primary role of boards and commissions is to represent many points of view in the community 
and to provide the Council with advice based on a full spectrum of concerns and perspectives. 
Council members may have a closer working relationship with some individuals serving on boards 
and commissions but must be fair and respectful of all citizens serving on boards and commissions. 
 
Keep political support away from public forums 
Board and commission members may offer political support to a Council member, but not in a 
public forum while conducting official duties. Conversely, Council members may support board 
and commission members who are running for office, but not in an official forum in their capacity 
as a Council member. 
 
Inappropriate behavior can lead to removal 
Inappropriate behavior by a board or commission member should be noted to the Mayor, and the 
Mayor should counsel the offending member. If inappropriate behavior continues, the Mayor 
should bring the situation to the attention of the Council and the individual is subject to removal 
from the board or commission. 
 
VIII.  Council Relations with the Media 
 
The media (newspapers, radio, television, etc.) frequently contact Council members for information 
and quotes. 
 
The best advice for dealing with the media is to never go "off the record" 
Most members of the media represent the highest levels of journalistic integrity and ethics and can 
be trusted to keep their word. But one bad experience can be catastrophic. Words that are not said 
 
cannot be quoted. Council members should not feel obligated to speak to the media. ''No comment" 
can be an acceptable response. 
 
The Mayor and City Manager or his/her designee are designated representatives to present and 
speak on the official City position. If the media contacts an individual Council member, the Council 
member should be clear about whether their comments represent the official City position or a 
personal viewpoint. Council members are encouraged to refer media contacts to the City Manager 
or his/her designee such as the Angleton Communications Director. 
 
All City press releases should go through the Mayor or City Manager’s Office for distribution 
The Angleton Communications Director maintains up-to-date contact information for all local 
media outlets that cover Angleton. In order to ensure that all media outlets are treated fairly, news 
releases should be submitted to the Angleton Communications Director, and must be approved by 
the City Manager prior to distribution coordination. Some items may be best handled as a "media 
advisory" or a feature story suggestion. Other items may be best handled as correspondence to a 
particular group.  The City Manager or his or her designee will work in conjunction with the 
Director of Communications regarding all press releases. 
 
Choose words carefully and cautiously 
Comments taken out of context can cause problems. Be especially cautious about humor, sardonic 
asides, sarcasm, or word play. It is never appropriate to use personal slurs or swear words when 
talking with the media. 
 
Remember the media lives by a tight deadline 
Because of the daily demands of the media business, deadlines are one of the most important factors 
for members of the media in determining what stories will be run. Because of these deadlines, it is 
essential for Council members to quickly reply to members of the media when they call for 
information on a story. 
 
IX.  
Sanctions 
 
Public Disruption 
Members of the public who do not follow proper conduct after a warning in a public hearing may 
be barred from further testimony at that meeting or removed from the Council Chambers by law 
enforcement. 
 
Inappropriate Staff Behavior 
Council members should refer to the City Manager any City staff that does not follow proper 
conduct in their dealings with Council members, other City staff, or the public. These employees 
may be disciplined in accordance with standard City procedures for such actions. Please refer to 
the section on Council Relations with City Staff for more details on interaction with City staff. 
 
Council Members Behavior and Conduct 
City Council members who intentionally and repeatedly do not follow proper conduct may be 
reprimanded or formally censured by the Council, lose seniority or committee assignments. Serious 
infractions of the Council Relations Policy or Angleton City Charter Article III or the Angleton 
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2 Administration, Article II City Council provisions may lead to other 
sanctions as deemed appropriate by Council. 
 
When necessary Council members should point out the offending Councilmember infractions of 
the Council Relations Policy. If the offenses continue, then the matter should be referred to the 
 
Mayor, City Manager, or City Attorney in private. It is the responsibility of the City Manager or 
City Attorney to speak with the offending Council member in private about the offenses. 
 
It is the responsibility of the City Manager or City Attorney to inform Council members of the 
repeated infractions and initiate action if a Council member’s behavior may warrant sanction.
