OLD BUSINESS 
 a. 
Discussion/possible action- Landscaping t La Marque Cemetery. 
 
Board Member Hanley suggests from the master garderner to put a type of stamp/ 
 
signature at the La Marque Cemetery that would stand out and represent the City 
 
of La Marque. Board member Brown suggests blue grass with yellow roses that are 
 
self maintaining and the color would represent The City as well. Ms. Hobby did  
 
inform the Board that there could not be any planting along the fence line due to 
 
the City’s landscapers having a hard time mowing in that area without interfering
