MADISON COUNTY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
I. 
SUBJECT: TEMPORARY CORONAVIRUS
(covrD-le) PoLrcY
coNCERt[rNG PAY, LEAVE AND REMOTE WORK
il. 
ISSUED: June 8,2020
HISTORY: In March of 2020, Govemor Cuomo issued anumber of Executive Orders that
modified the working conditions of municipal employees across New York State due to
the Coronavirus (COVID-l9) pandemic. Additional State and Federal laws temporarily
require pay for individuals, that meet certain criteria, who are unable to work. On May 18,
2020, Madison County will begin to repopulate the workplace in a multiphase approach.
This is a temporary policy that will terminate on December 31, 2020.
IV
PURPOSE: COVID-l9 continues to keep many employees away from their regular work
location. The intent of this policy is to provide a framework for: employees that are
permitted to work remotely and employees that are unable to work (at their regular work
location or remotely) due to an approved COVID-19 reason.
V. 
POLICY:
Paid Emergency Sick Leave for COVID-l9 Ouarantine or Isolation
For Employee - Employees may vtilize up to 14 calendar days of paid emergency
leave (based on your number of hours worked per week; pro-rated for part-time
staffl to use for their own mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or
isolation without utilizing their leave accruals or taking a leave without pay
(LV/OP). Utilizing this leave is subject to approval by a supervisor.
o For Family Member of Employee - Employees may utilize up to 14
calendar days of paid emergency leave (based on your number of hours
worked per week; pro-rated for part-time staff) to use for a bona fide need
to care for an individual subject to mandatory or precautionary order of
quarantine or isolation without utilizing their leave accruals or taking a
leave without pay (LV/OP). Utilizing this leave is subject to approval by a
supervisor.
o Leave is limited to caring for:
. An employee's immediate family member;
I I person who regularly resides in the employee's home; or
r { similar person with whom the employee has a relationship that
creates an expectation that the employee would care for this
individual if he or she were quarantined.
O
1
a
Paid emergency sick leave need not be provided in cases where the employee is
deemed asymptomatic or has not yet been diagnosed with any medical condition
and is physically able to work while under a mandatory or precautionary order of
quarantine or isolation whether through remote access or other similar means.
For example,37.5 hour/week employees shall be able to utilize up to a maximum of 75
hours of paid emergency leave, if needed. This is calculated using the number of hours
worked under a regular work schedule.
Approval of Paid Emergency Sick Leave
Supervisors will be responsible for approving the use of paid emergency sick leave.
Supervisors will require that employees send requests in writing explaining why the
emergency leave is being requested and, if illness-related, the name of the health care
professional they have consulted and guidance they have received. Medical documentation
will be required and should be included with the Employee Request for Emergency Paid
Sick Leave form (Attachment A).
Employees and their supervisors will be responsible for tracking to ensure that the use of
paid emergency sick leave doesn't exceed the 14 calendar day maximum.
Employees may not use paid emergency sick leave to accumulate more hours than allowed
in their standard workweek. For example, if a 37.5 hourl week employee works three
l0hour days due to work demands, and then needs to take emergency leave, they will only
use 7.5 hours of emergency leave to round out their 37.5 hour workweek.
Emergency Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Expansion
Employees are eligible for emergency FMLA benefits that provide up to 12 weeks ofjob
protected leave to an employee who is unable to work in-person, or work remotely, to care
for a child, under the age of eighteen, if the child's school or daycare is either closed or
unavailable due to the COVID-l9 virus, or to care for a child of any age incapable of
selfcare. The 12 weeks ofjob protection is NOT in addition to other FMLA needs.
The first ten days of an employee's emergency FMLA leave are unpaid, but an employee
may use accrued leave during this time or request to use Emergency Paid Sick Leave as
discussed above. After the first ten days of an employee's emergency FMLA leave, the
County will pay a full-time employee at two-thirds of the employee's regular rate of pay,
but capped at $200 per day or $10,000 per employee. Part-time employees are eligible for
the paid sick leave based on the number of hours that the employee is normally scheduled
to work over the covered period.
Employees who do not work due to personal decisions, or non-COVID-lg related illness
or injury, may, with approval of their supervisor, utilize their available leave time.
Employees should contact their supervisor or the Personnel Department with questions
about their non-COVID-lg related health conditions and work expectations.

Remotg WoIk Guidelines
Employees are encouraged to work remotely with advance approval from their supervisor
in order to avoid the possible spread of COVID-I9. Communication between supervisors
and staff will determine which titles and individuals are best suited for this work. Working
remotely will not be appropriate for all staff. A supervisor may require an employee that
has been approved for remote work to return to their normal work location on an as needed
basis, or permanently. Continuing a remote work assignment will be at the discretion of
the supervisor.
A supervisor must approve any work that extends beyond an employee's regularly
scheduled workday in advance. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action. A
fully executed COVID-I9 Remote V/ork Agreement (Attachment B) is required in order
to, amongst other things, evaluate work product, schedule supervision meetings and allow
for priorities to be set.

RESOLUTION NO.5
AUTHORIZING SPECIAL DISTRICT GRANTS
AND MODIFYING THE 2O2O ADOPTED COUNTY BUDGET
WHEREAS, New York State negotiated and structured a settlement of various Oneida
lndian Nation of New York ("OlN") related litigation and contested matters, which settlement
has taken the form of a Settlement Agreement among the OlN, the State of New York, the
County of Madison, & the County of Oneida ("Settlement Agreement") as approved by
Resolution No. 157-13 of the Madison County Board of Supervisors on May 30, 2013, and as
approved by the other parties to that Agreement, with Madison County acting pursuant to the
related state legislation implementing the Settlement Agreement (Chapters 174 and 175 of the
Laws of 2013, Executive Law Section 1 1 and lndian Law Section 16).
WHEREAS, Section V(E) of the Settlement Agreement, labeled "Nation Land Not
Taxable," provides in subsection (1), in pertinent part, as follows:
Without regard to whether land has been (or has not been) and is now (or is not
nów) exempt from property taxation or otherwise non-taxable, Nation Land shall
be non-taxable, and the Nation shall not be liable to the State or any municipal
subdivision of the State for any past, present or future property tax payment with
regard to Nation Land, and no bill for such tax shall be issued,...
WHEREAS, the Settlement Agreement and implementing state legislation have effected
a change in the taxable status of Nation Land (as defined in the Settlement Agreement).
WHEREAS, the full scope and effect of the Settlement Agreement remains to be
determined, particularly with regard to charges relating to special districts benefiting properties
directly.
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement Madison County is to receive certain
annual payments from the State of New York, the Settlement Agreement Section lll (B)
providing in part as follows:
The Counties share of all these payments is.,. in full satisfaction of tax revenues
of any kind that the Counties will not receive from the Nation... [emphasrs
addedl.
WHEREAS, nevertheless, given the current uncertainty and the adverse circumstances
to the special districts if their charges remain unpaid, it is the desire of this Board of
Supervisors to provide a share of the County's payments to certain affected special districts for
their 202Q fiscal years, to mitigate the impact on such districts of the potentially exempt status
of certain properties owned by the OlN.
WHEREAS, to that end Madison County intends to make grants, namely a one-time
payment, more specifically as provided in the attached Schedule of Parcels and Payments.
WHEREAS, a one-time payment will be made on or about June 9,2020; and will be
intended to mitigate the above referenced current fiscal year only and ls to be used solely to
support the infrastructure of and the municipal services provided to the taxpayers of such
districts.
WHEREAS, the Board does not commit to payments in future years and it presently
intends to evaluate the prospect of future payments annually.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE lT RESOLVED, that the Madison County Board of Supervisors
hereby authorizes the Madison County Treasurer to disburse as a grant the sums set forth and
described on the attached Schedule of Parcels and Payments to each of the districts set forth
therein totaling $80,1 50.33.
BE lT FURTHER RESOLVED, that lhe 2020 Adopted County Budget be modified as
