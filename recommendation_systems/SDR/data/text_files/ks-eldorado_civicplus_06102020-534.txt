COVID-19 Small Business Emergency Relief Grant
 
The El Dorado Chamber of Commerce would like to thank the
City of El Dorado for recognizing the need to support our local business
community, specifically the small businesses. 
We have found through our Relief program that there are businesses
locally that are not eligible or have not yet received funding through the
CARES ACT.  By allocating dollars to be
used to provide relief, we hope to continue to support businesses through
funding their emergency needs.  
 
Option 1:  We could
promote a campaign to the business community that the City of El Dorado has $150,000
of GRANT funds available to be used in the conjunction with the El Dorado
Chamber of Commerce’s Small Business COVID-19 Emergency Relief Grant.  We’ve included
our existing eligibility guidelines
and application.  
 
Option 2: Promote a campaign to the business community that
the City of El Dorado has $50,000 of GRANT funds available to be used in conjunction
with the El Dorado Chamber of Commerce’s Small Business COVID-19 Emergency
Relief Grant and that additional grant dollars could be made available to match
any contributions made by the private sector of our community.  The remaining $100,000
could be earmarked as
an Emergency Relief Loan Fund to provide support to our local business
community for any future needs.  The
terms of these loans could be decided by a committee or agreed terms between
the City of El Dorado and the El Dorado Chamber of Commerce.  We would like to propose
working with the El
Dorado Community Partners Inc. to receive and award funds.  Their nonprofit status makes
them more
attractive to donors.
