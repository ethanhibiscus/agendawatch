COVID-19 UPDATE.
Dr. Laura Kornegay, Health Director of the Central Shenandoah Health District, 
provided an update on COVID-19 in the Shenandoah Valley.
Dr. Kornegay noted that the Virginia National Guard assisted the Virginia 
Department of Health (VDH) and Rockingham County Fire and Rescue staff to administer 
May 27, 2020 (2)
COVID-19 tests earlier in the day.  She stated that approximately 300 tests were provided 
to citizens in about an hour.  
Dr. Kornegay announced two testing sites will be available in Harrisonburg on May
28, 2020, that will be able to administer 1,000 tests.  Governor Northam’s goal is to 
provide 10,000 tests per day statewide, and Dr. Kornegay noted seven to eight thousand 
tests are currently provided each day in Virginia.  Test kits and labs are currently available 
to test citizens in the community, and the Virginia National Guard will continue to assist 
with testing into June, she said.    
Dr. Kornegay indicated elderly citizens in long-term care facilities have been 
tremendously affected by the pandemic.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
developed guidelines for a Phase 3 reopening of long-term care facilities, which have been 
locked down over the last ten weeks.  Robust testing will be needed in order to open the 
long-term facilities, Dr. Kornegay said.
Dr. Kornegay did not know how many cases were first identified when employees 
entered temperature check stations at manufacturing facilities, but she expected the number
was high.  She noted manufacturing facilities, medical facilities and nursing homes have 
done a good job in screening citizens.  
Dr. Kornegay indicated testing was not available at the beginning of the pandemic, 
but sending employees home and isolating them from others was key to limiting the 
number of people affected.  Dr. Kornegay indicated the Health Department has been in 
communication with poultry plants, which are the largest manufacturing facilities in the 
area, since the last week in March.  She stated those employees are generally the 
vulnerable population because they often do not have much access to healthcare.  
Dr. Kornegay said the Health Department worked with the poultry plants at the 
beginning of the outbreak to review their operation plans, and revisited the plants when 
COVID-19 numbers increased.  In addition to putting additional safeguards in place, the 
companies sent employees home and supported them to quarantine.  Numerous companies 
initiated short-term disability and extra sick leave in addition to providing environmental 
controls to help employees, she said.  
Dr. Kornegay noted the epidemiology curve looks positive and seems to be on the 
downward trend in the area and the state.
Chairman Kyger asked Dr. Kornegay whether the different approach used by 
Shenandoah Valley industries and those on the eastern shore regarding whether to reopen 
during Phase 1 was due to the ability to handle the surge of patients with hospital rooms 
and necessary equipment.  Dr. Kornegay indicated the only hospital on the eastern shore,  
Riverside Shore Memorial Hospital, is a critical access hospital with 23 medical beds and 
six intensive care unit beds.  When that hospital was full, people on the eastern short had to
travel to a hospital in Norfolk or Virginia Beach.  Dr. Kornegay indicated there are more 
than 600 beds available between Sentara RMH and Augusta Health, so there has not been a
capacity issue in the Valley.  
Dr. Kornegay said the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) performed inspections at 
manufacturing facilities (poultry plants) on the eastern shore and found the facilities had 
already initiated most precautions the CDC would have recommended.  
Dr. Kornegay indicated testing was provided by the plants, which agreed to fund 
and perform point-prevalence studies.  A lab was brought in to perform the tests.
In response to a question, Dr. Kornegay said the number of COVID patients who 
have recovered has not been calculated yet.  The VDH hopes to add that data to their 
website soon.  
Dr. Kornegay indicated the State is planning a serology adult-prevalence study 
using antibody tests to determine how many people were infected, especially people who 
were exposed but did not have symptoms.  They will enroll 5,000 people by mid-July and
May 27, 2020 (3)
hope to provide a report in August.  Those participating in the study will be enrolled 
through the regional healthcare system.  
Dr. Kornegay indicated the VDH does not have data on the number of people who 
have tested positive without showing symptoms.  She believes data gained from the study 
will provide that information, which will help the VDH make future decisions.  Dr. 
Kornegay said working with the Criminal Justice System and performing point-prevalence 
surveys should be helpful as all inmates and staff in a facility will be tested on the same 
day.  
In response to a question regarding how trace contract testing is handled, Dr. 
Kornegay explained that all positive cases are tracked and may be considered a positive 
case or a clinical case.  She noted doctors who do not provide testing, but think a patient 
has COVID symptoms or may have been exposed to COVID, refer the patient to the 
Health Department as a clinical case, which is tracked.  The VDH contacts people 
identified as being in close contact with the COVID-patient two days before they became 
symptomatic, to request them to quarantine for 14 days.
Dr. Kornegay noted that most of her staff is dedicated to the pandemic as case 
investigators, contact tracers or assisting in some other role.  The VDH has received 
federal funding to hire contact tracers, and Dr. Kornegay anticipates hiring 30 additional 
contact tracers.  A contact tracing computer application will be available on May 29, 2020, 
to enter information about contacts so the VDH can check on them daily via phone, email 
or text to identify contacts that have become symptomatic.
In the transitional phase, where social distancing is relaxed, testing and contact 
tracing are important to avoid a second surge of the virus.  Dr. Kornegay said citizens can 
loosen up a little, while continuing to social distance, wear masks, wash their hands 
frequently and avoid crowds.  Otherwise, there will be a huge rebound of cases that could 
overwhelm the health system.
Dr. Kornegay indicated the VDH has an estimate of positive cases within various 
industries that have been traced to a source other than the employer.  She said it was not 
difficult to trace the source of the virus when there were fewer cases and people traveling 
from other states or countries were spreading the virus.  The virus is now spreading 
throughout communities, including places of work, making it difficult to determine where 
someone was exposed.  
Dr. Kornegay said the VDH appreciates the support from County staff, especially 
with testing.  Chairman Kyger indicated he has been impressed with the cooperation and 
extreme efficiency of the Virginia National Guard, Virginia Department of Health, and 
County staff.
In response to a question from Supervisor Trumbo, Dr. Kornegay indicated she did 
not know if the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health (VOSH) Program provides 
inspections to ensure safe work practices, but said the VDH does not perform inspections 
or regulate industries.  The VDH does provide recommendations to employers regarding 
infection control.  Dr. Kornegay noted she, along with County staff and others, participated
in a virtual tour of Cargill to view their practices.  
Supervisor Breeden noted he saw a website advertisement for a seminar regarding 
new OSHA standards, which he will share with Supervisor Trumbo.
Supervisor Trumbo said he thought VOSH should offer resources when requested, 
particularly since COVID-19 is a recordable, compensable illness.
oooooOooooo
TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT.
The Board heard Mr. Komara’s report on the activities of the Transportation 
Department, including updates to bridge, road and rural rustic projects.
May 27, 2020 (4)
Additionally, Mr. Komara reported that VDOT started work on the Bicycle/Buggy 
lane extension along John Wayland Highway (Route 42) from Dayton to just before 
Walmart in mid-March and finished the lane extension on April 17th.  He noted a lot of the 
design work was executed in-house.
VDOT is exploring a Safe Routes to School sidewalk project in Broadway, with an 
80/20 match.  Mr. Komara also said the passing lane on Brocks Gap Road (Route 259) 
near Hisers Lane (Route 752) will be eliminated due to the number of accidents that have 
occurred there.
Mr. Komara reported the bridge replacement project on Smithland Road (Route 
720) that was originally planned to have four lanes at a cost of $15 million, has been scaled 
back to two lanes.  The bridge will be constructed so it may be expanded to four lanes, if 
desired later.
Mr. Komara noted that VDOT is designing the dual left turn lanes on Spotswood 
Trail (Route 33) at Spotswood High School and receiving lanes at the school entrance in-
house.  Work is expected to begin next summer.  Since this is a revenue sharing project, 
Mr. Komara will request revenue sharing funds, and may be able to use money remaining 
from other projects.
The Friedens Church Road (Route 682) bridge replacement project will move 
forward this fall.  VDOT has cut trees and built a detour, since the current road will be 
closed for approximately six months.
VDOT continues to work on utility plans and finish obtaining rights-of-way to 
widen South Valley Pike (Route 11) so construction of the four-lane road can begin in the 
spring of 2020-2021.  Typically, a year is required for right-of-way and utility relocation, 
so the timing will be tight, Mr. Komara said. 
In response to a question from Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison, Mr. Komara said there 
was a slight design element change on South Valley Pike.  The median is wider to provide 
room for the R-cuts and U-turns.
Mr. Komara noted that the Board has requested aligning Cecil Wampler Road 
(Route 704) and Oakwood Drive (Route 704), but if a longer bridge is installed, it may 
impact the flood plain and Route 11.  In addition, a reverse curve will be required on Cecil 
Wampler Road to align the road with the current bridge.  Mr. Komara said that VDOT 
believes the best option is to make improvements to the existing intersection configuration.
The two traffic signals on South Valley Pike (Route 11 South) are functioning to 
allow enough time for trucks to depart, but Mr. Komara thinks a right turn is needed from 
Cecil Wampler Road onto Route 11 and from Oakwood Drive (Route 704) onto Route 11. 
Since there is a funding deficit on the South Valley Pike four-lane project, Mr. Komara 
recommended using excess funds from the Route 704 project toward the four-lane project 
to keep it moving forward.  He informed Administrator King that all the work can be 
performed as one project.  Administrator King agreed with continuing with the project, but
suggested that the County continue to work on other options for the Pleasant Valley area.
Maintenance items included completing the first mowing along primary roads, with 
the exception of Spotswood Trail (Route 33 East) from Harrisonburg.  VDOT has not 
started mowing along secondary roads, but Mr. Komara hopes the first mowing will be 
completed in two to three weeks.  VDOT has performed plant-mix patching on many roads
and resurfaced the Mt. Crawford Park & Ride.  Mr. Komara noted a pending application 
for Smart Scale funding would expand the parking to approximately 80 spaces, with a 
charging station and bus stop, at an estimated cost of $2 million.
Mr. Komara informed Supervisor Breeden that a new Verizon pole was installed to 
replace the pole that was split in half.
-----
May 27, 2020 (5)
Mr. Komara reviewed a corridor study for Route 33 East, to be used as a planning 
tool to keep traffic flowing without additional traffic signals.  If VDOT awards the funds 
for a US 33 Arterial Management Plan, its consultant will look at median treatments and 
intersections, develop innovative designs, review accident locations, and provide support 
to request funding to correct issues.  Mr. Komara noted access to commercial businesses 
has to be balanced with safety for citizens.  He said a 2006 study will serve as background.
After reviewing VDOT’s Arterial Management Program, Mr. Komara said he 
thinks it is a good opportunity.  He said the County may decide to move forward with 
some recommendations, and not others.  Ms. Cooper indicated, if the application is 
approved, the consultant would start on the study this summer.  She believes the study 
needs to be completed by mid-year 2021; VDOT wants to posture the study for the next 
round of Smart Scale project applications.
On motion by Supervisor Breeden, seconded by Supervisor Chandler, and carried 
by a roll call vote of 5 to 0, voting recorded as follows: BREEDEN – AYE; CHANDLER 
– AYE; KYGER – AYE; TRUMBO – AYE; WOLFE-GARRISON – AYE; the Board 
adopted the following Resolution Requesting Funding for an Arterial Management Plan for
Route 33 East from Harrisonburg to Elkton, with no cost to the County:
RESOLUTION
REQUESTING FUNDING FOR AN
ARTERIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
WHEREAS, the Board of Supervisors of Rockingham County desires to study and plan 
for the future of the US 33 corridor, which serves as the primary east-west access across 
the County, a corridor of statewide significance, and a critical component of the regional 
network; and 
WHEREAS, US 33 passes through the Stone Spring Urban Development Area, for which 
the Board of Supervisors adopted an Urban Development Area Plan on January 22, 2020; 
and
WHEREAS, US 33 also serves several Urban Growth Areas designated in the 
Rockingham County Comprehensive Plan; and
WHEREAS, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), through its Arterial 
Management Program, seeks to preserve this corridor while also accommodating existing 
and future development by identifying ways to ensure safety and maintaining the capacity 
without wide-scale roadway widenings and traffic lights; and 
WHEREAS, VDOT has funding available, with no contribution by the County, to prepare 
Arterial Management; and
WHEREAS, VDOT and County staff recommend that an application be submitted to 
request funding for an Arterial Management Plan for the segment of US 33 east of the City
of Harrisonburg to the Town of Elkton to guide the County and the development 
community in decision-making processes that will ultimately lead to safer access while 
minimizing congestion; planning and designing the appropriate level of access for future 
development in the corridor; and improving the County’s position when applying for 
Smart Scale, Revenue Sharing, and other transportation project grant funds. 
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Rockingham County supports this 
opportunity to study and plan for this important corridor, while accommodating existing 
and future development, with a US 33 Arterial Management Plan.
Adopted this 27th day of May, 2020

May 27, 2020 (6)
Supervisor Trumbo asked if an asphalt patch along the shoulder of American 
Legion Drive (Route 800) is temporary.  Mr. Komara responded that he would find out.
Supervisor Chandler informed Mr. Komara that the grass is high on the right side 
of Massanetta Springs Road (Route 687) where it intersects with Spotswood Trail (Route 
33).  He also noted the left turn lane heading west on Spotswood Trail near the 7-Eleven 
convenience store, where traffic turns onto Massanetta Springs Road, is narrow and short.  
Supervisor Chandler said it looks like the line for the turn lane was placed in too far, and 
noted through-traffic passes close to vehicles in the turn lane.
Supervisor Chandler asked Mr. Komara to look at Williams Run Road (Route 672) 
to determine if it qualifies as a rural rustic project.
Chairman Kyger requested that a tree on the west side of Greenhouse Road 
between addresses 8187 and 8398 be removed.  He said it is about to fall down, due to 
ground hogs burrowing under the tree.
Chairman Kyger requested that Messrs. Komara and Lindsey meet with him and 
Mr. McNult at Rawley Springs regarding the road extension, from the mailboxes to the 
bridge, which is not being maintained.  Chairman Kyger will contact Mr. McNult.
Chairman Kyger discussed closing Erickson Avenue (Route 726) to through truck 
traffic because truck drivers create noise with their jake brakes in the middle of the night.  
He noted that a few years ago, a nearby industry educated their drivers not to use jake 
brakes at night.  Chairman Kyger asked Mr. Komara if signage could be erected for “No 
Jake Brakes”, and said the trucks could travel through Harrisonburg.  Supervisor Wolfe-
Garrison stated the industry’s employees need another educational meeting, and jake 
brakes and through trucks should not be allowed on Erickson Avenue.
Mr. Komara noted the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) 
prohibits putting up “No Jake Brakes” signs.
Chairman Kyger and Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison suggested requesting that the 
company have another educational meeting with their truck drivers and companies 
supplying them, regarding the use of jake brakes on Erickson Avenue, particularly during 
late night and early morning hours.  If that is not effective, the possibility of making 
Erickson Avenue a “No Thru Trucks” route should be explored, Chairman Kyger said.
Mr. Komara stated Erickson Avenue is a designated truck route, but could possibly 
be widened.  Since Erickson Avenue is scheduled for an overlay this year, he suggested 
widening the pavement to create turn lanes on Erickson Avenue.
Administrator King asked that the Board allow staff a couple weeks to talk with the
industry and investigate the possibility of trucks using another route.
Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison indicated trucks from the nearby industry are not the 
only trucks traveling on Erickson Avenue.  Trucks from the eastern side of the County 
travel on Erickson Avenue to access Route 33 and head to West Virginia, she said.  
Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison indicated this should be identified as a solution, not an 
accusation toward a particular industry.
Chairman Kyger said he believes talking with the industry may resolve a majority 
of the problem.
In closing, Mr. Komara noted traffic volumes are down and speeds are up on 
Interstate 81.
oooooOooooo
May 27, 2020 (7)
DISCUSSION – CITIZEN UPDATES REGARDING COVID-19.
Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison said several citizens have requested that the County be 
proactive in sharing information with the public.  She suggested providing data-driven 
information specific to the County, similar to what Dr. Kornegay provided.  The data could 
be shared by a radio broadcast, TV-3 interview, live video, Facebook, or a posting to the 
County website.  Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison stated updates need to be provided on a 
consistent basis, and the purpose of the presentations are to provide data and information 
about what is occurring in the County.
Chairman Kyger agreed that providing accurate information eliminates future 
problems.  Since staff continues to deal with different aspects of the COVID-19 virus, 
Chairman Kyger said he did not want to add an extra burden to County staff, and suggested
having someone on the perimeter collect the information and provide it to the public.  
Chairman Kyger noted that Joshua Gooden may be willing to coordinate a way to collect 
data and communicate with the public on a routine basis, not just during the pandemic.  He
also suggested requesting input from media outlets in the area about the best way to 
provide the data.  Supervisor Chandler noted that the updated information needs to come 
from the VDH.
Chief Holloway indicated Fire and Rescue prepares a weekly informational packet 
for distribution.  He has access to most data, but he wants to be sure information reported 
is accurate.  Chief Holloway explained that as a precaution, the Fire and Rescue 
Department considers a clear (or non-active) case to be a COVID-19 patient who 
recovered from the virus and has been non-active after 21 days, rather than the 14 days 
used by most organizations.  Chief Holloway said the County could report that and explain
the calculation used. Chief Holloway noted the updates could include information such as 
Governor Northam’s recommendations and what is being accomplished locally.
Chief Holloway said 299 citizens were tested earlier in the day for the COVID-19 
virus.  The citizens were provided a care package and extra masks.  Many of the citizens 
tested were asked how they heard about the testing location.  Most of them indicated they 
saw the notice on Facebook or television, and some learned about it from the newspaper.  
Chief Holloway indicated 500 flyers were distributed around the County over the last few 
days, but very few citizens reported that they learned about the testing from the flyers.
Chairman Kyger stated the metric used needs to be qualified and the science behind
it explained.  People need to understand the calculation is a best-guess estimate, which 
may not be precise.  In response to a question from Chairman Kyger, Administrator King 
said, throughout the pandemic, the County has not had more than 20 citizens hospitalized 
at one time, and that number has declined over the last couple days.  He noted there have 
been five deaths in the County.
Chairman Kyger informed Chief Holloway and Administrator King that if they 
could determine a way to provide citizens with consistently-updated, accurate data, he 
wanted them to design a distribution method.  Chairman Kyger asked Supervisor Wolfe-
Garrison if she would bounce ideas off Administrator King and Chief Holloway to help 
design a way to communicate with the community.  Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison said the 
design may need to evolve.
Supervisor Chandler noted that the source of the data will be the VDH; County 
staff are not creating the data.
Supervisor Trumbo agreed with Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison, and stated utilizing 
Zoom and limiting the number of attendees at Board meetings, makes communication 
more essential.  He said the information provided should be tailored based on questions 
received from the public.  Supervisor Trumbo stated the County needs to hear from the 
public to know what information to provide.
Chairman Kyger agreed that it would be good if the process is community-driven 
and said the County may need to open the lines of communication by providing the initial 
May 27, 2020 (8)
data and informing citizens how they can respond and ask questions of County staff.  He 
wants people to be able to base their decisions on accurate information.
Chairman Kyger said there should be a County contact to receive emails from the 
public and coordinate the process, such as Joshua Gooden or someone in the Fire and 
Rescue Department.

STAFF REPORTS.
Chairman Kyger indicated the staff reports on the agenda are for informational 
purposes, with the exception of specific action items.
oooooOooooo
COUNTY ATTORNEY’S STAFF REPORT.
Mr. Miller said, in working with Treasurer Todd Garber, he and Administrator 
King prepared a resolution based on statutory authority where the Treasurer cannot impose 
a late penalty and interest if the late payment is not the fault of the taxpayer.  The 
Resolution, if adopted, authorizes the Treasurer to provide guidance as to what is not 
presumptively the fault of the taxpayer.  The taxpayer will need to sign a statement 
indicating the situation and stating they are not able to pay their taxes due to COVID-19.
Mr. Miller indicated interest will be charged August 31, 2020 and is retroactive to 
June and July.  A statement will be provided to the taxpayer.
Mr. Miller said Treasurer Garber informed him that tax payments are coming in 
very similar to last year, and he has not received much input from citizens with difficulty 
in paying their taxes.
Mr. Miller reviewed the draft resolution with Board members and staff.
On motion by Supervisor Trumbo, seconded by Supervisor Chandler, and carried 
by a roll call vote of 5 to 0, voting recorded as follows:  BREEDEN – AYE; CHANDLER 
– AYE; KYGER – AYE; TRUMBO – AYE; WOLFE-GARRISON – AYE; the Board 
adopted the following resolution, time-dated to August 31, 2020:
RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, COVID-19 has descended upon the human race, causing unprecedented
governmental actions that have produced significant negative financial consequences for
private businesses and individuals, and
WHEREAS, COVID-19 has in some cases caused medical situations for households and
individuals that also have resulted in significant negative financial consequences for those
households and individuals, and 
WHEREAS, the Code of Virginia in Section 58.1-3916 states that penalty and interest for
failure to pay a tax in a timely manner shall not be imposed if such failure was not the fault
of the taxpayer and, further, that the failure to pay a tax timely because of a medically
determinable physical impairment shall be presumptive proof of lack of fault on the part of
the taxpayer, and
WHEREAS, Section 58.1-3916, also authorizes the Board of Supervisors to grant
reasonable extensions, not to exceed 90 days, for the payment of real estate taxes.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, by the Board of Supervisors of
Rockingham County, Virginia, that proof that medical or financial circumstances brought
about by COVID-19 caused a taxpayer to fail to pay real estate tax due by June 5, 2020,
shall be considered presumptive proof of lack of fault on the part of a taxpayer, and the
May 27, 2020 (9)
usual penalty and interest shall not be imposed, so long as the tax is paid no later than
August 31, 2020.  If the tax is not paid by August 31, 2020, penalty and interest shall be
imposed as usual, that is, as of June 6th and July 1st, respectively.  The Treasurer may
accept as proof a signed, written statement from the taxpayer, satisfactory to the Treasurer,

ASSISTANT COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR'S STAFF REPORT.
The Board received and reviewed Mr. Armstrong’s staff report dated May 27, 
2020.  
Mr. Armstrong informed the Board that Shenandoah Valley Hemp, a business that 
has been operating two years and recently located their main headquarters in Elkton, would 
like to apply for an Agriculture & Forestry Industries Development Fund (AFID) grant.  
The business provides cannabidiol (CBD) extraction, fiber storage and distribution from 
this location.  They also provide seeds, post-processing, packaging, and distribution 
services for the local hemp industry.  Mr. Armstrong indicated Shenandoah Valley Hemp 
is developing a strong network of farmers, vendors and consumers to produce products in 
the Valley. 
Shenandoah Valley Hemp plans to add 24 new positions over the next three years.  
Mr. Armstrong indicated Shenandoah Valley Hemp’s machinery and tools investment will 
amount to approximately $3.794 million dollars over three years.  The local request is for a
$50-75 thousand one-time match.  If the locality provides a match, the State is willing to
provide a match.  
Mr. Armstrong indicated an immediate decision was not required, but he would 
like to inform Shenandoah Valley Hemp by June 10, 2020, whether the Board is willing to 
support and allocate funds to them.
Administrator King indicated this is the first request the County has had from a 
business in a town.  Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison asked if the town can also provide money 
and Mr. King responded that towns cannot apply for AFID grants on behalf of a business.
Mr. Armstrong noted the County is receiving guidance from the Virginia Economic
Development Partnership (VEDP) regarding the Town’s involvement.
Administrator King said the Board needs to look at the projected revenue and what 
that would mean for the Town and the County.  Typically the County recoups their money 
from the company’s real estate taxes and maintenance & tools taxes.
In response to a question from Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison, Mr. Armstrong said he 
believes the business will use the money in the next fiscal year, but he will confirm that, in 
case it needs to be included in the FY21 budget, for approval on June 10, 2020.
By consensus of the Board, this item will be included on the June 10, 2020 agenda 
for Board consideration.
Chairman Kyger brought attention to the tourism report and video clips, which he 
said were very well done.

PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE
Mrs. Davidson indicated seven bids were received and opened on April 24, 2020, 
for contractors to provide sewer jetting services to the Public Works Utilities division.  The
work consists of flushing and vacuuming blockages from sewer mains and laterals, as 
needed.  Bids were evaluated based on hourly rates and fees were compared to specific 
work scenarios.  The contractors will be utilized on a rotation basis and will be contacted 
by Public Works staff to determine their best time and price for the project.  Administrator 
King interjected that another important consideration is how quickly their business can 
respond.
Staff requested the Public Works Committee approve the top three contractors to 
allow flexibility in scheduling and response times if any of the contractors are not 
available.  The Public Works Committee recommended Stillwater Septic Service Sewer & 
Drain Cleaner, Inc., Cox Construction, Inc., and Visu-Sewer East, LLC be approved to

people are still flying and are using SVRA when they have business or leisure trips.
Chairman Kyger reminded the Board that SVRA Executive Director Greg 
Campbell and Airport Commissioner Michael Heatwole previously reported the airport

travel industry rebounds.
Chairman Kyger reported that SVRA is proceeding with the taxi expansion to the 
hangar area, but the new commercial hangar is on hold.  He encouraged people to use 
SVRA because the airport is operating, the planes are clean and they will get you to your

STAFF REPORT:   
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT 
 
BOARD ACTION REQUESTED 
Staff requests Board support for its evaluation and possible revision of fees charged for services in 
Community Development, in two phases.  Phase 1 would focus on plumbing, electrical, and mechanical 
permit fees; staff anticipates presenting the Board with a revised fee schedule around mid-summer for 
these three permit types.  During Phase 2, staff would review the remaining Community Development-
related fees.  GIS and land use fees were last revised in 2010 and 2016, respectively. 
PROJECTS AND REPORTS 
LAKE SHENANDOAH STORMWATER CONTROL AUTHORITY (Lisa Koerner Perry)  
The public hearing which was originally scheduled for March 25 has been set for June 10. 
US 33 ARTERIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (Rhonda Cooper) 
VDOT has recommended, at no cost to the County, that US 33 East be the subject of an Arterial 
Management Plan.  The Board’s Resolution of Support has been forwarded to the VDOT Staunton 
District for inclusion in the application, which is expected to be submitted by around June 12. 
VDOT would work with the County to develop a plan dedicated to preserving this corridor while also 
accommodating existing and future development.  Arterial Management Plans are used to identify ways 
to ensure safety and preserve the capacity of Virginia’s arterial highway network without wide-scale 
roadway widenings and traffic lights.  An Arterial Management Plan would help guide localities and the 
development community in their decision-making processes that will ultimately lead to safer access 
while minimizing congestion; planning and designing the appropriate level of access for future 
development in the corridor; and improving the County’s position when applying for Smart Scale, 
Revenue Sharing, and other transportation project grant funds. 
Staff recommends the Plan encompass US 33 East from the City/County Line to Elkton Plaza at the west 
side of the Town of Elkton and, due to the length of this corridor, specifically emphasize the:  
 
segment between the City/County Line and Lawyer Road, including possible focus areas at the 
Rockingham Park Way / US 33 intersection and Indian Trail Road between Rockingham Park and  US 
33, and 
 
key intersections between Lawyer Road and Elkton Plaza 
o Island Ford Road 
o Resort Drive 
o East Point Road 
o Mt. Hermon Rd. 
o Rockingham Pike at Elkton Plaza. 
With Board involvement, the final focus areas will be determined early in the process.  If the 
development of a US 33 Arterial Management Plan has Board support, in a few weeks VDOT will 
request the Board provide a resolution of support.  Once the VDOT Central Office approves the scope 
and funding, the study could commence in fall 2020 and conclude in late 2021 in advance of the 2022 
round of Smart Scale applications.

Parks & Recreation Coronavirus Adjustments: 
 
Starting Monday, March 30th I will have my folks divided up into several groups to address the work that we 
hope to complete over the next few weeks.  One group (which will be referred to as the Rockingham Park 
Group) will consist of Marco, David, Dontae’, and Rick.  These folks will report to work at Rockingham Park 
each day and utilize the press box located at Albert Long Fields as their office (each person gets their own 
corner).  IT has helped me get computer hookups there that will connect with the network.   
 
The second group (which will be referred to as office/miscellaneous duties group) will consist of Jerry, Denise, 
Regina, Jessi, and Taylor.  This group will be subdivided into two sub-groups in which one will have 3 and the 
other 2.  The group of 2 will be responsible to man the office, answering phones, and dealing with the day to 
day paperwork and administration of the department.  The group of 3 will take care of other tasks outside of 
the office and work with other departments.

RESOLUTION - PRELIMINARY SCHEDULE OF RATES, FEES AND CHARGES.
Assistant County Administrator Armstrong recalled a presentation provided by Director
of Environmental Services, Lisa K. Perry, at the February 12, 2020, Authority meeting. During
that meeting, Mrs. Perry had reviewed methodologies of calculating stormwater fees and
indicated staff’s recommendation to use the “Rooftop Method”. A preliminary rate of $0.10 per
square foot was recommended.
Mr. Armstrong explained that in order to proceed, State Code requires preliminary rates
to be adopted by Resolution. 
Additionally, adopting a preliminary rate would allow staff to send estimated fees to
property owners within the boundaries of the Authority. Mr. Armstrong also pointed out that this
is a preliminary rate, a rate which could be changed pending the public hearing.
On motion by Supervisor Chandler, seconded by Supervisor Wolfe-Garrison, and carried
by a vote of 5 to 0, voting recorded as follows: BREEDEN – AYE; CHANDLER – AYE;

Lake Shenandoah Stormwater Control Authority
General Information and Answers to Frequently Asked Questions
The Problem
A watershed is all of the land area that drains to a set point in the landscape.  Watershed boundaries are defined by the
topography.  The land area that ultimately drains to Lake Shenandoah is within a single watershed boundary.
Over the past 20-plus years, land in the Lake Shenandoah watershed has been developed into residential subdivisions
and other types of developments.  These developments occurred under different stormwater management standards
based on when they were designed.  Over the years, increasing amounts of runoff have shown that some of the older
infrastructure is no longer adequate for carrying runoff away from homes and roadways.  This results in periodic flooding
of a number of homes and roadways in the area, which damages properties and impedes access.
LSSCA Proposal Summary
The Lake Shenandoah Stormwater Control Authority has been formed to facilitate improvements to stormwater 
infrastructure in the Lake Shenandoah watershed, with the goal of reducing the frequency of urban flooding that occurs 
in several neighborhoods.  These improvements may include new detention ponds, improved ditches, and culvert 
upgrades. Proposed fees for each property owner within the Lake Shenandoah Stormwater Control Authority are to be 
calculated based on the square footage of rooftop area of all buildings on each property, at the rate of $0.10/ square 
foot.
Estimated Total Expenses
The anticipated total costs of improving the infrastructure have been estimated below:

Engineering Costs - $150,000

Acquisition of properties and easements - $2,000,000

Construction of mitigation strategies - $800,000 - $2,400,000 (specific strategies not yet chosen)

Ongoing operation & maintenance costs over 10 years - $200,000
Total = $3.15 - $4.75 M
Grant funding to offset costs will be pursued but is not guaranteed. Grant programs exist through various agencies for
funding of stormwater infrastructure improvements. The grants are competitive, and application does not guarantee
funding. The County is currently pursuing multiple grant-funding opportunities for the Lake Shenandoah watershed.
Cost-share funding is also available from the Virginia Department of Transportation for roadway improvements.  Securing
this funding is also competitive.
What fees will be charged?
In order to pay for the mitigation work, the Lake Shenandoah Stormwater Control Authority proposes to fund the
improvements by collecting a fee from property owners within the Lake Shenandoah watershed.  The fee is proposed to
be based on square feet of rooftop area.  Many localities in Virginia have similar fees.  The currently proposed rate of
$0.10/sq. ft. of rooftop area, assessed across all structures in the watershed will result in $440,000 collected per year.
Assessed over a 10-year period, a total of $4.4 million will be collected, which should be adequate to cover the costs
outlined above.  If the total costs turn out to be lower than expected, the annual fee would be reduced accordingly.

Website: rockinghamcountyva.gov
Why is the fee based on rooftop area?
Rooftop area is a good indicator of how much rain will leave a property as stormwater runoff rather than soaking into the
ground.  It is also very straightforward to measure, which helps keep administration costs low.  County GIS maps already
contain data for the total rooftop area of structures.  This data is collected by either using handheld GPS units to map the
outline of each structure at the time it is built or by using aerial photography.  An example is shown below.
Example:
In this image, the yellow shapes are houses.  The blue shapes are accessory buildings such as detached garages or
sheds.  The information box in the lower right hand of the image provides the area of each one of those shapes.  It is
important to note that the rooftop area will not be the same as the square feet of living space of your home.  The rooftop
area is a top-down measurement of the surface of your roof.
That information is then put into a table that links account numbers for each structure, and calculates a fee based on the 
rooftop area at the currently proposed rate of $0.10/square foot.
My property doesn’t flood, why should I be charged for infrastructure upgrades?
Infrastructure improvements are designed to accommodate runoff from all properties in the watershed.  Even if your
property doesn’t experience flooding, the water that flows from your roofs, mowed lawns, and parking areas during rains
will make its way into the ditches and pipes designed to carry away the surface runoff. Runoff from all properties

TELEPHONE (540) 564-3027  ∙   FAX (540) 564-3017
Website: rockinghamcountyva.gov
accumulates in the system, causing flooding in low-lying areas where the existing infrastructure is inadequate to handle
the total amount of water.
What have developers done to mitigate runoff?
Subdivisions within the Lake Shenandoah drainage area were developed over many years under varying standards
pertaining to stormwater management. These developments were designed to meet the regulations at the time they were
constructed. Even under older regulations, many of the subdivisions were required to have stormwater detention ponds.
Newer developments have designed stormwater management systems to the higher standards that are currently in place.
What are some of the specific improvements being considered?
Several options are currently being considered as infrastructure improvements.  One project that looks very cost-effective
is a new detention basin on the south side of Taylor Spring Lane.  Other strategies being considered are channel
improvements in the Highland Park subdivision area and a second detention basin area that would improve conditions
from approximately Shen Lake Drive down to Lake Shenandoah.
Why doesn’t the County just stop approving development within the watershed boundary?
Just as was the case when your home or business was built, the County has an obligation to respond to the public need
and demand.  The County has chosen to focus development in areas with available water and sewer, roadways, and
other infrastructure; in the County’s seven towns; and around the City of Harrisonburg. 
Why not make the developers (past or future) pay for the stormwater improvements?
There is no mechanism to make past developers, builders, or owners contribute toward the needed improvements,
particularly because past developments met then-current standards.  Recent and future developments are being held to
current, higher stormwater standards.  The costs to meet those standards will be reflected in development costs,
purchase prices, and rental prices for homes and businesses in the drainage area. Through the market economics,
additional costs to developers ultimately still come back to homeowners and renters.
Why should those within the Lake Shenandoah watershed boundary bear the costs?  Why not cover the 
expense with countywide tax revenues?
The County’s General Fund revenues may be utilized to fund projects and services that benefit the County as a whole.
Funding to construct the fire and rescue station on Port Republic Road is an example of such a project.  While the station
may primarily benefit those in the area, all County residents have the potential to travel in the area, visit the hospital and
businesses, and benefit from the station.  The station is also part of the provision of emergency services for the entire
County, serving as backup to the areas beyond their immediate service area, as needed.
If all County citizens were assessed a tax, all should see some level of benefit.  The flooding in most areas of the County
does not result from urban stormwater. If it were so, costs would likely be greater per parcel and would extend well
beyond the 10-year borrowing proposed for the Authority and may limit how and when the urban flooding from
stormwater in the Lake Shenandoah watershed could be addressed.

It became further evident in 2018 that the flooding 
posed a real risk to public safety - citizen committee 
formed to study solutions 
 
Formation of Stormwater Control Authority 
recommended, due to problem being larger than any 
one individual subdivision, and due to HOA’s not 
having adequate resources for coordinated response 
 
COUNTY INVOLVEMENT 
 
 
Following public outreach presentations & a 
public hearing, the Lake Shenandoah 
Stormwater Control Authority (LSSCA) formed 
to facilitate infrastructure upgrades needed to 
reduce flooding 
AUTHORITY FORMED 
At present, the LSSCA has taken two major 
steps: 
 
Negotiations for purchase of land in a beneficial 
location  
 
Contracted engineering firm to analyze watershed 
characteristics & stormwater runoff, and to 
evaluate what of improvements will be the most 
cost-effective 
ACTIONS TO DATE 
Purchase of a specific property in the Lake 
Shenandoah watershed would have 3 major 
benefits: 
 
Prevent development of ~30 acres along the main 
drainageway 
 
Provide a prime location for new runoff detention pond 
 
Create opportunity for a public passive recreation area, in 
part of the County that does not have similar parks

TIMMONS REPORT 
Estimates used to calculate project costs: 
Engineering Costs - $150,000 
Acquisition of properties and easements - $2,000,000 
Construction of mitigation strategies - $800,000 - $2,400,000 
(specific strategies not yet chosen) 
Ongoing operation & maintenance costs over 10 years - 
$200,000 
Total = $3.15 - $4.75 M 
 
Does not include County staff time (finance, legal, 
administration, environmental services, Treasurer, 
GIS, IT, etc.)   
 
COST ESTIMATE 
Direct relationship between impervious areas & 
stormwater runoff, rooftop area is proposed as 
the basis for fee calculation 
 
Rate of $0.10/ sq. ft., assessed over a period of 
10 years = $4.5 million  
 
Revenues may ONLY be used for mitigation 
expenses. 
 
Revenues and expenses will be fully accounted 
for and part of County’s annual audit. 
FEE ASSESSMENT 
Lake is drawn down because damage to the emergency spillway from 2018 
is considered a risk for downstream properties (erosion on the back side ) 
  
Lake will be drawn down until repairs to the emergency spillway can occur 
–timeline through 2021 
 
The dam itself also needs work per DCR dam safety, plan to do that 
concurrently 
  
DGIF estimates 20 acres will still be underwater 
 
A culvert will be added this year that will allow large equipment to access 
the dam area for when the work is ready to occur 
 
They’d like to incorporate improvements to fishing & boating access with 
the work
