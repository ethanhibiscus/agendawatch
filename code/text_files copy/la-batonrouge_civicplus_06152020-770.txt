CERTIFICATION OF INABILITY TO OPERATE DUE TO LACK OF QUORUM 
In accordance with Executive Proclamations JBE 2020-30 and 2020-33, issued by Governor John Bel Edwards 
on March 16, 2020 and March 22, 2020, respectively, this notice shall serve as a certification of the Planning 
Commission’s inability to otherwise operate in accordance with the Louisiana Open Meetings Law due to a 
lack of a quorum as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency. 
Pursuant to Section 4 of JBE 2020-30, the Planning Commission for the City of Baton Rouge and Parish of East 
Baton Rouge will provide for attendance at its next meeting, which will only contain business deemed 
essential government business, on Monday, June 15, 2020, via video conference.  A gathering of the entire 
membership of the Planning Commission and necessary staff would violate Governor Edwards’s order 
suspending all public gatherings of 50% of normal capacity while practicing social distancing. The items 
appearing on the agenda have been deemed essential for the continued conduct of business by City of Baton 
Rouge/Parish of East Baton Rouge. 
Considering the foregoing, and in accordance with Proclamation Numbers JBE 2020-30 and JBE 2020-33, the 
Planning Commission meeting on Monday, June 15, 2020, at 5:00 p.m. will be held via video conference and in 
a manner that allows for observation and input by members of the public, as set forth in the Notice posted.
