Resolution No. ________ 
City _____________, State_______________ 
  
Resolution urging the United States Congress to enact the 
Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act 
  
WHEREAS, an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a special report on the 
impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in October 2018 warning that 
global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the 
current rate. 
  
WHEREAS, the United Nations climate science body said in a monumental climate report that 
we have only until 2030 to make massive and unprecedented changes to global energy 
infrastructure to limit global warming to moderate levels; and 
  
WHEREAS, the United States government released its Fourth Annual Climate Assessment in 
November 2018 reporting that the impacts of climate change are already being felt in 
communities across the country, and that more frequent and intense extreme weather and 
climate-related events, as well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to 
continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide essential 
benefits to communities; and 
  
WHEREAS, conservative estimates by the world's climate scientists state that, to achieve 
climate stabilization and avoid cataclysmic climate change, emissions of greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) must be brought to 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050; and 
   
WHEREAS, presently the environmental, health, and social costs of carbon emissions are not 
included in prices paid for fossil fuels, but rather these externalized costs are borne directly and 
indirectly by all Americans and global citizens; and 
  
WHEREAS, to begin to correct this market failure, Congress can enact the Energy Innovation 
and Carbon Dividend Act to assess a national carbon fee on fossil fuels based on the amount of 
CO2 the fuel will emit when burned and allocate the collected proceeds to all U.S. Households in 
equal per-capita shares in the form of a monthly dividend; and 
 
WHEREAS, for efficient administration, the fossil fuels fee can be applied once, as far upstream 
in the economy as practical, or at the port of entry into the United States; and 
  
WHEREAS, as stated in the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, a national, 
revenue-neutral carbon fee starting at a relatively low rate of $15 per ton of CO2 equivalent 
emissions and resulting in equal charges per ton of CO2 equivalent emissions potential in each 
type of fuel or greenhouse gas should be assessed to begin to lower what are now dangerously 
high CO2 emissions. The yearly increase in carbon fees including other greenhouse gases, 
 
 
shall be at least $10 per ton of CO2 equivalent each year, with the provision that the annual 
increase will be $15 per ton of CO2 equivalent if statutory goals are not met; and 
   
WHEREAS, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act specifies that, in order to 
protect low and middle income citizens from the economic impact of rising prices due to the 
carbon fee, equal monthly per-person dividend payments shall be made to all American 
households (½ payment per child under 19 years old) each month from the fossil fuel fees 
collected. The total value of all monthly dividend payments shall represent 100% of the net 
carbon fees collected per month; and 
  
WHEREAS, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act encourages market-driven 
innovation of clean energy technologies and market efficiencies which will reduce harmful 
pollution and leave a healthier, more stable, and more prosperous nation for future generations; 
and 
  
WHEREAS, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act will, after 12 years, lead to a 
decrease in America’s CO2 emissions of 40 percent and preserve national employment; and 
  
WHEREAS, border adjustments - carbon content-based levies on products imported from 
countries without comparable carbon pricing, and refunds to our exporters of carbon fees paid - 
can maintain the competitiveness of U.S. businesses in global markets; and 
  
WHEREAS, a national carbon fee can be implemented quickly and efficiently, and will respond 
to the urgency of the climate crisis because the federal government already has in place 
mechanisms, such as the Internal Revenue Service, needed to implement and enforce the fee, 
and already collects fees from fossil fuel producers and importers; and 
  
WHEREAS, A national revenue-neutral carbon fee would make the United States a leader in 
mitigating climate change and in the clean energy technologies of the 21st century and would 
provide incentive to other countries to enact similar carbon fees, reducing global C02 emissions 
without the need for complex international agreements, and 
  
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT: 
  
RESOLVED, that the Town of Carrboro, North Carolina urges the United States Congress to 
enact without delay the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, and 
  
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the City Manager or City Clerk, no later than 30 days after 
passage of this Resolution, shall transmit copies of this resolution to the President and Vice 
President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to the Majority 
Leader of the Senate, to each U.S. Senator and Representative from the State of North Carolina 
in the Congress of the United States, and to nearby city and county governments urging that 
they pass similar resolutions. 
 
 
 
 PASSED AND ADOPTED as a resolution of the City Council of the Town of Carrboro , State of 
North Carolina at its regularly scheduled meeting held on ________________, 2020.

PURPOSE 
 
The purpose of this item is for advisory board members to consider amendments to the Land Use 
Ordinance that would establish a new Climate Action and Environmental Sustainability 
Commission as an update to the existing Environmental Advisory Board.  The Town Council has 
set a public hearing for June 16, 2020 and has requested advisory board review prior to the 
hearing.   
 
INFORMATION 
 
During the March joint review meeting and again in April/May, staff discussed possible options 
to shift some of the development review duties of the Environmental Advisory Board to the 
Planning Board and Appearance Commission to advance implementation of the Town’s climate 
action plans.  While all of the boards noted the importance of advancing the climate action plans, 
some members of the Planning Board and Appearance Commission expressed reservations with 
the proposal to take on certain aspects of environmental review historically addressed by the 
EAB.   
 
A draft ordinance has been prepared that would establish a new Climate Action and 
Environmental Sustainability Commission (CAESC).  The new name emphasizes the role the 
commission to serve as the advisory board tasked with leading the Town’s efforts toward climate 
action planning, and a new provision under 15-45.2(a) articulates this charge.  The existing duties 
relating to development review would remain with the CAESC.  Planning staff would facilitate 
the discussion of development applications and amendments, when required, to allow the 
Environmental Sustainability Coordinator to focus on climate action 
 
The existing EAB would sunset; interested candidates would apply for appointment to the new 
commission.  The nine-member CAESC would ensure sufficient membership for broad expertise 
in environmental topics relating to climate action and sustainability as well as development 
review.  A requirement for at least two members to have special expertise related to climate 
action implementation such as renewable energy use or energy efficiency in building design 
and/or construction, use or promotion of alternative transportation, and/or community 
engagement/grass-roots organizing related to climate action or similar environmental initiatives, 
is included.   
 
The Appearance Commission would continue to serve as the Town’s Tree Board under the Tree 
City USA standards, with some duties shared at times and as appropriate with staff and other 
advisory boards and commissions.  
 
A public hearing has been set for June 16, 2020.  The Town Council must receive public 
comments before adopting amendments to the Land Use Ordinance.  Orange County and 
Planning Board are also needed.  The Appearance Commission and Environmental Advisory 
Board have also been identified for referral based on their purview. 
 
 
RECOMMENDATION 
 
Staff recommends that advisory boards review the draft ordinance (Attachment B) and consider 
adopting a recommendation for inclusion in the public hearing materials for June 16th.  A 
recommendation template has been provided for the boards to use (Attachment A).
