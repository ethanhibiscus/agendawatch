PLANNING STAFF COMMENTS:  
This site is near the intersection of North Clinton Avenue and Perry Street, directly across the 
street from the municipal court. The first floor commercial was formerly a bail bond office. The 
N. Clinton Redevelopment Area Plan specifically encourages the type of residential over 
commercial development that exists on this site.

1. Applicant shall testify to comments and concerns of Taylor Design Group dated May 11,

Re:

212 North Clinton Avenue 
Block 1603, Lot 27 
City of Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey 
Preliminary and Final Site Plan with bulk variances  
Planning Letter #1 
TDG Project No. 2002-122.203P  
Dear Board Members, 
Our office has received and reviewed the following submission items 
• Application, submitted by Community Asset Preservation Corporation, dated 
December 13, 2019. 
• Preliminary and Final Site Plans, prepared by Brick City Reconstruction, consisting of 
5 sheets, dated November 20, 2019. 
We offer the following comments: 
A. Site, Surrounding Land Uses, and Proposal 
1. The subject property is 0.06 acres (2,500 sq. ft.) in area and is located on North Clinton 
Avenue, mid-block between Grant Avenue to the north and Lincoln Avenue to the south 
in the Mixed-Use North Clinton Avenue Redevelopment Area.  The lot contains an 
existing 3 story structure, where the first floor was used for a retail service office and 
the second and third floors each contain one, 2-bedroom apartment. 
2. The site is adjacent to a residential building to the south.  The Trenton Police 
headquarters and court are located to the west across North Clinton Avenue.  The two 
lots to the north are owned by the City and are maintained as lawn, with newly planted 
trees and perennials in planters.  See image below, aerial courtesy Google.  
3. The applicant proposes to renovate the existing structure as follows:  
a. First Floor- Reduce the commercial space from 1,168 SF to 400 SF and create a 
600 sq. ft. accessible studio apartment. 
b. Second Floor- Reconfigure the space and install new kitchen and bathroom. 
c. Third Floor- The unit will remain as presently configured. 
No changes are proposed to the site.  
 
 
 
 
Page 2 of 3 
 
TDG 
 
B. Variances and Zoning  
1. The lot and the building have the following existing non-conforming conditions that are 
not proposed to change:  
a. Minimum lot area; where 4,000 SF is required, but 2,500 SF exists. 
b. Minimum lot width; where 40’ is required, but 25’ exists.  
c. Minimum side yard setback; where 10’ is required, but 2’ exists.   
d. Minimum rear yard setback; where 35’ is required, but 32’ exists 
2. The project requires the following new bulk variances:   
a. Parking:  Please note that the property is just north and outside of the Ewing-Carroll 
and Train Station Downtown Parking Districts.  Therefore, the requirements at 
§315-187 apply.   
i. The parking requirement for the Existing building is as follows:  
Two- 2 BR apartments @ 1.5 spaces per unit: 
3 spaces 
1,168 SF Retail @ 1 space per 250 SF in excess of 1,000 SF: 
.67 spaces 
Total Parking Requirement Existing Building  
 3.67 or 4 Spaces 
 
ii. The parking requirement for the Proposed building is as follows: 
Two- 2 BR apartments @ 1.5 spaces per unit: 
3 spaces 
One- 1 Studio apartment @ 1 space per unit: 
1 space 
400 SF Retail @ 1 space per 250 SF in excess of 1,000 SF: 
0 spaces 
Total Parking Requirement Proposed Building  
4 Spaces 
Although there is no net increase in the required number of spaces with rounding, due to 
the fractional increase, coupled with the creation of a new residential unit without parking, 
the Board may wish to take the conservative approach and consider this a variance, as 
well as a de minimis exception from the NJ Residential Site Improvement Standards. (RSIS)   
 
 
 
 
Page 3 of 3 
 
TDG 
The Applicant should provide detailed testimony in support of all required bulk or “c” 
variances pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70c.  Testimony should confirm that:  
• the request relates to a specific piece of property, 
• a purpose of Zoning put forth in the Municipal Land Use Law would be advanced by 
a deviation from the requirements of the ordinance, 
• the variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good, 
• the benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment, and 
• the variance will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and 
zoning ordinance. 
C. General Comments 
1. We note for the Board that there are no opportunities to increase the number of off-
street parking spaces without removal of the building.  The benefits of retaining and 
rehabilitating the building are consistent with the goals of the North Clinton Avenue 
Redevelopment Plan. 
2. Testimony should be provided regarding any proposed repair and replacement of the 
existing storefront, windows, doors, sign band, and cornice treatment.   
3. Consideration should be given to improving the left building façade adjacent to the City 
owned lots/parklet.  This could include new siding, or repair and painting of the existing 
siding in a warmer, neutral tone.  Testimony should also be provided whether the 
removal of the vinyl siding would be possible, if the underlying brick masonry is in 
satisfactory condition. 
4. Testimony should be provided regarding any temporary or permanent tenant 
displacement as the result of the reconfiguration and rehabilitation, pursuant to the 
Redevelopment Plan. 
5. We recommend that the flood light be eliminated in favor of a down light, or at a 
minimum it should be angled at 45° or less and be shielded. Further, the LED color 
temperature should be 3000°-3500° Kelvin to reduce lighting glare impacts.   
6. Testimony should be provided whether a street tree can be provided as required in 
front of the site.  If there is not sufficient area, perhaps the tree could be located on 
the City lot adjacent to the site to break up the mass of the black façade.  
If you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to 
contact our office.

PLANNING STAFF COMMENTS:  
This site is near the intersection of North Clinton Avenue and North Olden. It is adjacent to a 
line of new rowhomes on North Clinton. The first-floor commercial was formerly Fishes 
Lounge. The N. Clinton Redevelopment Area Plan specifically encourages the type of residential 
over commercial development that exists on this site. The site plan does not address the garage 
on the back of the property, which appears to be in very poor condition. 
 
CONDITIONS TO CONSIDER: 
 
1. Applicant shall testify to comments and concerns of Taylor Design (Forthcoming). 
2. Applicant shall testify to expected tenant circulation on site to access all apartments.  
Access from the front of the site, and access from the alley. 
3. Applicant shall testify to lighting and safety issues for accessing all apartments from the 
front of the site and from the alley.   
4. Applicant shall testify to potential green infrastructure and stormwater mitigation on the 
site in order to address any problems caused by the building exceeding imperious cover 
limits on the site. 
5. Applicant shall testify to expected garage improvements on the back of the property.  
Applicant site plan says, “not in scope”.  What does the applicant intend to do to make 
the garage, at the minimum, visibly appealing?
