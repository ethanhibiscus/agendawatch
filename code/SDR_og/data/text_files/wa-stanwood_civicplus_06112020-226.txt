Agenda Items: 
1. Blueline Contract, Scope and Fee for 101st Improvements
Staff is looking at grant options to help fund this project. This project may meet the
requirements for the Safe Routes to School grant (SRTS) and Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG). Blueline has a lot of experience with this type of
project and locating grants.
The Committee asked staff to check to see if this project could qualify for funds
through a Trail grant.
Committee Recommendation: Take to full Council on June 11, 2020 with a
recommendation to enter into a contract with Blueline.
Discussion Items: 
 Project Updates: 

SR532 Berm and Pedestrian and Bike Trail
The project was designed and bid to include a chain link fence. The fence will
be highly visible and a main focal point as it will run along SR532. Staff asked
the contractor, Faber Construction for quotes for a different type of handrail that
will fit the City’s vision to “Beautify Stanwood”. The lowest quote (attached) will
increase the project cost by $88,716.00.
The Engineer’s estimate for this project was $882,000 and the bid came in at
$782,733 so the overall budget for the project would absorb the extra cost
without a budget amendment.
Also, the loan the City got for this project has a great rate and can be paid off
over time.
Committee Recommendation: No recommendation at this time, but the
Committee would like staff to bring to full Council for discussion.

 
297 Zone Water Reservoir 
The Reservoir project is moving along, the sand blasting is done and it’s 
currently being pressure washed so it can be coated. The old tank will be 
pressured washed and recoated upon completion of the new reservoir. The 
contractor is working on making the connections to the existing system. The 
City did receive a few noise complaints during the sand blasting, but once the 
crew informed the citizens of the duration of the blasting, they were OK. 
 
 
90th Ave Road Extension 
SRV Construction has rolled in several large pieces of equipment, so lots of 
activity going on. The curbs were poured on June 1st.    
 
Several unforeseen issues have come up creating delays: 
 
 Fiber ducts were in the way of where the sewer line was designed to go. 
 A water main was close to where SRV was digging, a fitting on the main 
was disturbed causing a large leak. The water crew was able to get it fixed. 
 Due to poor soil, SRV is struggling to keep the road in place. 
 There has been 5 days with delays, the cost of each delay is $8,000 per 
day, (total so far $40,000 and more delays are expected) staff and the 
consultants from KPG are working hard to solve these issues as fast as 
possible to keep the construction crew working. KPG is on site everyday 
making sure SRV is doing everything possible to keep the project moving. 
 
276th Overlay 
Reece Construction started work on the 276th Overlay project on June 1st.  
The scope of work includes replacing most of the ADA ramps so they are in 
compliance with the ADA regulations. The committee asked what the cost 
would be to fix all of the ADA ramps in the project area. The average cost to 
fix one ADA ramp is $4K - $5K ($20K per intersection).

We are working to bring back joy to the community.    
 
c. Councilmember Reports and Questions  
 
Councilmember Pearce wanted to apologize for missing the Safety Committee Meeting.  He 
will plan to be at the next one.  
 
Councilmember Shepro asked Chief Cermak to give a report for the North County Regional 
Fire Authority. 
Chief John Cermak noted that the Stillaguamish Indian Tribe donated $300,000 to develop 
the Public Safety Training Center.  In addition, $300,000 was donated to the Stanwood 
Foodbank.   We really have super partners out there!  Thank you! 
 
Councilmember Roberts shared that he was recently in Tennessee visiting family.  That 
state is now open at about 75% and it seems to be going well.  People there are sanitizing, 
wearing masks etc.  Our numbers are doing a lot better in Washington.  Thank you to the 
Mayor and group for really trying to get people back to work.  It is very unfortunate that some 
Stanwood businesses will not be able to recover and won’t be opening when we move 
forward.

DATE:         
     June 11, 2020 
SUBJECT:       
Authorize the Public Works Director to approve the 90th 
Avenue NW/Viking Way Improvement Project change orders 
CONTACT PERSON: 
Kevin Hushagen, Public Works Director 
ATTACHMENTS:      
A – Change Order 1 
B – Change Order 2 
ISSUE 
The issue in front of council is whether or not to authorize the Public Works Director to 
approve two change orders for the 90th Avenue NW/Viking Way improvement project.   
SUMMARY STATEMENT 
Change Order 1 is due to material that was called out in the roadway section, had too 
many fines to allow it to act as intended.  The recommendation is from the city’s 
geotechnical engineer HWA Geosciences Inc. 
Change Order 2 is due to delays caused to the contractor by the fault of others.  
DISCUSSION 
Change Order 1: The existing ground under the new Viking Way/90th Avenue is very 
poor and subject to failure due to vehicles and vibrations.  The plans had called for 
ballast, when it should have been permeable ballast.  This also changes the top course 
(cstc – gravel) to a base course (csbc) which is bigger and better for this construction. 
This area, being in the floodplain, is difficult to build roads and other structures in.  This 
change to the material used will improve and increase the useful life of the roadway.    
Change Order 2: Because the historical use of this area was a private parking lot and 
utilities were constructed throughout this area, including Water, Sewer, Storm, Cable, 
Power, and Gas that need to be re-routed or disconnected are the purpose for this 
change. There is minimal as-built information available and some of these utilities, 
including gas and cable, have been in direct conflict with the plans.  Additionally, parts 
of this water system was constructed when the Stanwood Water Company owned the 
7-1
system, and is difficult to know exactly where it is.  This has created a total of 5 days of 
delay for the contractor. Due to the state and federal grants funding this project, all 
change orders must be approved by WSDOT prior to approval. See Attachment A and 
B for the change order justification description. 
FINANCIAL IMPACT 
 
The total for change order 1 is $65,567 and change order 2 is $40,000.  The total 
project construction bid is 2,407,661.86.  After Change Orders, the revised contract 
amount will be $2,513,228.86. The budgeted amount for construction, based on the 
engineer’s estimate of $2,996,772. The Change Orders do not require a budget 
amendment.  
 
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION 
 
The Public Works Committee was informed of the change orders and that they would be 
coming to full council for approval. 
 
CITY COUNCIL OPTIONS 
 
1.   
Authorize the Public Works Director to approve the 90th Avenue NW/Viking Way 
Improvement Project change orders. 
 
2.  
Do not authorize the Public Works Director to approve the 90th Avenue 
NW/Viking Way Improvement Project change orders and direct staff to areas of 
concern.  
 
 
RECOMMENDED MOTION 
 
I MOVE TO AUTHORIZE THE PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR TO APPOVE THE 90TH

Contract Working Days:

Contract Time Affected by this Change Order: 
Zero (0) days added or reduced 
New Estimated Contract Completion Date: 
10/28/20 
Reason for Contract Change Order: Per Donald Huling of HWA (Geotechnical Engineer) the 
recommended material to be placed in between the layers of geotextile fabric in the roadway section 
was to be a clean crushed rock or permeable ballast.  The plans specified ballast to be used.  Due to the 
number of fines in the ballast, the section will not act as intended to allow ground water to freely flow 
through the section.   
The native material under the roadway section is very poor and subject to failure due to wheel loads 
and vibratory compaction.  It is not practical to stabilize the subgrade by over excavation, placement of 
granular material and compacting, as all downtown Stanwood, including this project, sits on top of silty, 
tidal deposits.  Vibratory compaction of the CSBC and later the HMA to achieve 95% and 91% 
respectively is risky in that the native material will likely “pump”.  The City has experienced subgrade 
failure on two other projects in proximity due to “pumping”.  This Change Order intends to reduce the 
risk by not allowing vibratory compaction 
ATTACHMENT A 
7-3
 
 
Description of Work included in Change Order: This Change Order is being written to change the 
material type used in the roadway section in accordance with Design Change #04. 
 
The compaction requirements of 95% in WSDOT Standard Specification Section 4-04.3(5) for CSBC and 
91% in 5-04.3(10)B1 for HMA are superseded by the following: 
 
Compact with a 10-ton steel drum roller without using vibrator rolling.  The Engineer will take densities 
on CSBC, and later the HMA, and use said densities to observe that the effort is made to achieve the 
best compaction possible without vibratory rolling.  Densities will be taken during the rolling pattern.  
Two criteria will be used by the Engineer to determine that enough compaction effort has been made.  
Compaction will be considered acceptable when 1.) efforts seem to be pushing or pumping the CSBC 
and later the HMA; 2.) densities during the pattern peak out and do not increase with additional static 
rolling.

JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANGE ORDER #01 
 
 
1. Why is this change order being written? 
This Change Order is being written to 
• 
Change the material type used in the roadway section in accordance with Design Change #04. 
• 
Modify the compaction requirements on the Crushed Surfacing Base Course (CSBC) from 95% to 
field accepted by the Engineer with no vibratory compaction allowed. 
• 
Modify the compaction requirements on the ½” PG 64-22 Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) to be maximum 
achievable with 10-ton roller using static rolling only. 
 
2. What did the plans and specifications require? 
• 
Per plan the roadway section was to be built with a layer of geotextile fabric, triaxial grid, 1.33’ of 
ballast, another layer of geotextile fabric, 0.33’ CSBC and 0.33’ of HMA.   
• 
WSDOT Standard Specification 4-04.3(5) requires the CSBC to be compacted to 95%.   
• 
WSDOT Standard Specification 5-04.3(10)B1 requires the HMA compaction to be 91%. 
 
3. Why won’t the current plans work? 
Per Donald Huling of HWA Geotech, the recommended material to be placed in between the geotextile fabric 
layers of the roadway section was to be a clean crushed rock or permeable ballast.  The plans specified 
ballast to be used.  Due to the number of fines in ballast the section will not act as intended to allow ground 
water to freely flow through the section.   
Compaction Efforts: 
The native material under the roadway section is very poor and subject to failure due to wheel loads and 
vibratory compaction.  It is not practical to stabilize the subgrade by over excavation, placement of granular 
material and compacting, as all downtown Stanwood, including this project, sits on top of silty, tidal deposits.  
Vibratory compaction of the CSBC and HMA to achieve 95% and 91% respectively is risky in that the native 
material will likely “pump”.  The City has experienced subgrade failure on two other projects in close proximity 
due to “pumping”.  This Change Order intends to reduce the risk by not allowing vibratory compaction.  
 
4. Which items will be added by this Change Order? 
Permeable Ballast 
Crushed Surfacing Base Course 
 
5. Which items will be affected by this Change Order?  (Include increased or decreased plan quantities) 
BI# A-30 Ballast (4970 Ton) 
BI# A-31 Crushed Surfacing Top Course (990 Ton) 
 
6. What does this change order accomplish? 
This Change Order 
• 
Changes the material to be used in the roadway section using the recommendations made by the 
geotechnical engineer.  
• 
Reduces the risk of subgrade failure by not allowing vibratory rolling. This risk reduction is 
implemented by the Engineer by accepting the CSBC and HMA compaction by observing the efforts 
made with Static Rolling using a 10-ton steel drum compactor. 
 
7. (A)  How does this change order solve the problem? 
By changing to a permeable ballast from ballast, ground water will be able to flow through the road section 
freely.  Not allowing vibratory compaction reduces the risk of pumping the native material under the subgrade. 
 
(B)  What is it you are asking the contractor to do?

Use the new materials in place of planned materials per Section 1 and 2 above.  
Compact with a 10-ton steel drum roller without using vibrator rolling.  The Engineer will take densities on 
CSBC, and later the HMA and use said densities to observe that the effort is made to achieve best 
compaction possible without vibratory rolling.  Densities will be taken during the rolling pattern.  Two criteria 
will be used by the Engineer to determine that enough compaction effort has been made.  Compaction will be 
considered acceptable when 1.) efforts seem to be pushing or pumping the CSBC and later the HMA; 2.) 
densities during the pattern peak out and do not increase with additional rolling. 
 
8. What new materials (if any) will be incorporated into this change order?

Background:  Prior to starting the project SRV made it apparent that they were 
not comfortable with the planned roadway section.  At the request of SRV the 
design was revisited with HWA and Perteet.  It was determined that the specified 
ballast was not sufficient and that a permeable ballast is preferred.   Per 
recommendations by SRV a change to permeable ballast was made as well as 
substituting crushed surfacing base course for crushed surfacing top course 
within the road section.

As previously stated SRV is very concerned with the performance of the foundation as designed. 
We have made recommendations and provided pricing upon request, without any response. To date we 
have not seen a geo tech onsite to give any  which  we have requested. 
  
To reiterate SRV is concerned with line and grade of the newly installed utilities per design. 
  
Please let us know how to proceed.

Dustin – 
  
Shawn has given me the go ahead to proceed with the changes to the ballast as discussed in last week’s meeting as well 
as substituting crushed surfacing base course for the crushed surfacing top course in the road section.  A few things I 
could use from you: 
  
1) Could you provide an update to the typical sections to reflect this change so I can issue a design change?  Yes, 
we’re on it. 
2) With this change we would also like to see an increase in the CSBC section from 4 inches to 6 inches reducing 
the ballast section by 2 inches to compensate.  Will this reduction have any impact on the structural integrity of 
the new road section?  Don’t think so, HWA was good with it, but I’ll run it buy our pavement expert. 
7-17

3) There are concerns about placing the curb and gutter directly on the fabric as shown in the typical sections.  SRV 
has said that their subcontractor intends on placing the curb and gutter using a curb machine.  The boot on the 
machine is designed to cut into 0.1’ of rock during placement of the concrete.  I believe the increase in the rock 
section with a decrease in the ballast should solve this issue, do you agree? Yes. And actually the section weren’t 
quite represented properly. We had 4” HMA over 4” CSTC. So an 8” section. With the gutter being 6” deep that 
would have left 2” of CSTC between the gutter and geotextile. Increasing the CSTC depth to 6” will give us 4” of 
CSTC between the bottom curb/gutter and geotextile. Were you going to check with SRV to see if they wanted 
to switch CSTC to CSBC and if there would be any cost implications? 
  
Please let me know if you need anything else for this.  Thanks.

Thanks for the correction on the unit costs. For now I'll refer to the Permeable Ballast spec. I will assume that 
the fact that the % passing the 3/4" sieve is slightly lower is not an issue and that we can approve that material 
once they have a formal submittal on it.

Subject: Re: 90th - Discussion on Pavement Subgrade 
  
Hi all, 
  
I heard from David that we are moving forward with the change in material. I wanted to make sure we all and 
the contractor are in agreement about what exactly is changing before we update the plans. Here is my 
understanding: 
1. Change the BALLAST in Note 4 on the RS sheets to PERMEABLE BALLAST PER STANDARD 
SPECIFICATION 9-03.9(2). I want to confirm this is the correct spec everyone had in mind. The 
contractor previously sent an example of Railroad Ballast (attached) which has a slightly different 
gradation than Permeable Ballast. The only part of the Railroad Ballast gradation that didn't meet the 
Permeable Ballast spec was that the Permeable Ballast spec requires 40-80% pass the 3/4" sieve. The 
Railroad Ballast sample provided had 34.6% passing the 3/4" sieve. 
2. Change the depth of the CSTC from 4" to 6" and the depth of the Ballast from 16" to 14". With 4" of 
HMA and 6" of CSTC this will provide 4" of CSTC under the curb and gutter. There was some concern 
that construction vehicles or the curb machine would catch on the geotextile and increasing the depth 
of crushed should reduce the risk of this happening. 
3. There was discussion on changing the CSTC to CSBC. David indicated that SRV said there would be a 
cost increase of $6.60 per ton.  
Cost impacts 
1. SRV indicated there would be $55,000-$70,000 increase for using the different ballast material. This 
would have been based on the bid quantity of 4,970 tons. I'm not sure of the exact price that was 
agreed upon but this comes out to an additional $11-$14 per ton. I looked at our estimate backup and 
the new quantity I have for ballast would be 4,290 tons. Note that this does have a healthy contingency 
of 30% so it may come in much lower. If we use an increase of $12.50 per ton, the revised total for 
Ballast would be 4,290 tons x $31.50 = $135,135 or an increase of $40,705 from the bid amount. 
2. The CSTC bid item is used for the pavement section but also under sidewalks, driveways, and parking 
lot restoration behind sidewalk. If we assume the increase to 6" and change from CSTC to CSBC occurs 
only under pavement/curb/gutter we should have revised quantities of 1,560 tons of CSBC and 940 
7-20
3
tons of CSTC. Note that both of these have a 15% contingency. With CSTC at $19/ton and CSBC at 
$25.60/ton this comes out to a total of $17,860 for CSTC and $39,936 for CSBC. Together that is 
$57,796 or an increase from the bid total of $10,296. 
Unit price for CSTC is $25/TN, CSBC would be $31.60/TN.  This would bring the total to $23,500 for CSTC and $49,296 
for CSBC.  A combined total of $72,796 or an increase of $25,296. 
3. Assuming SRV agrees to the unit prices of $31.50 for Permeable Ballast and $25.50 for CSBC AND all of 
the contingencies are used I see a potential cost increase to the project of about $51,001. Of course 
the quantities are all estimates.  
Using the increase of $25,296 for  CSBC this would result in an estimated total of $66,001. 
Questions 
  
Allen/David - Is the attached Railroad Ballast spec what SRV has been basing their price increase on? 
The attached is what SRV is basing their costs on. 
Donald/Sandy - Do you see any issues with using the attached spec vs. permeable ballast spec? 
  
Thanks!

Subject: 90th - Discussion on Pavement Subgrade  
  
Hi all, 
  
I've been made aware of concerns about the proposed pavement subgrade on the project pertaining to the 
ballast material. We need to if a change in the material is warranted and any potential cost implications and so 
so soon. HWA and I have availability tomorrow afternoon noon and Friday after 10am. At a minimum Allen 
and Shawn should also attend. Please let me know your availability. I'm thinking a video call is sufficient. 
  
Thanks,

JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANGE ORDER #02 
 
 
1. Why is this change order being written? 
This Change Order is being written to compensate the Contractor for inefficiencies experienced from 4/20  
through 4/24/20 caused by multiple instances of utility conflicts, as well as for those experienced on 5/4/20 
caused by a major leak in the City’s watermain. Contract time has already been addressed by granting 
nonworking days for these dates. 
 
2. What did the plans and specifications require? 
The Contractor’s Critical Path Baseline Schedule was developed following the criterion below; their schedule 
had 90th Ave NW being constructed ahead of Viking Way: 
 
Construction under traffic and access 1-07.23(1): These sections detail requirements such as lane 
restrictions, pedestrian responsibilities, detours and allowable lane closures.  The Contractor will coordinate 
with the Engineer and adjacent property owners and tenants to communicate and plan access.   
 
Follow lane closure restriction requirements per SP 1-07.23(1): 
a. 271st St NW & 88th Ave NW: 
i. Maintain at least one lane open in each direction at all times except installation of utility crossings 
across roadway. May request in writing to flag traffic down to one lane to install utility crossings 
and connections. 
ii. Contractor may request full closure of 88th Ave NW only for sanitary sewer connection, and this 
may only occur between 9am-3 pm M-F.   
b. 90th Ave NW & Viking Way: 
i. Lane closures may occur on 90th Ave NW or Viking Way but not concurrently. 
ii. Contractor may request limited closures in writing. 
iii. Vehicular business access signs must be provided at all times. 
iv. An ADA accessible route must be maintained to all businesses including but not limited to: 
1. Between Stanwood Foursquare Church and its annex 
2. Between Stanwood Hardware and customer parking south of Viking Way 
3. Between Viking Way north of Viking Village and parking south of Viking Way. 
 
3. Why won’t the current plans work? 
Several utility conflicts on 90th Ave NW caused by erroneous locations and/or lack of locations on the plans or 
in the field vs. actual field conditions caused inefficiencies in the pursuit of Baseline Schedule work.  SRV 
then moved operations and work activities onto Viking Way so that they could keep their crews and 
equipment working on unimpeded activities while the Engineer resolved the conflicts on 90th. 
 
4. Which items will be added by this Change Order? 
For the events and time frame described in Section 1, BI# A-CO02 Utility Conflict Inefficiencies is added by 
this Change Order as a $40K Lump Sum item. 
 
5. Which items will be affected by this Change Order?  (Include increased or decreased plan quantities) 
N/A 
6. What does this change order accomplish? 
See Section 1. 
 
7. (A)  How does this change order solve the problem? 
See Section 1 
 
(B)  What is it you are asking the contractor to do?

ton, force account, etc.)  List item and unit. 
Lump Sum 
 
11. Will working days be affected? 
☐  YES 
☒  NO 
 
Number of days that will be added: The Engineer did not charge working days the week of 4/20/2020 or on 
5/4/2020 as the Contractor was not able to pursue critical path work due to conflicts.   
12. Will we need an updated Progress Schedule from the Contractor to the impact of the 
additional work resulting from the C.O.? 
☒  YES 
☐  NO 
Date Requested from Contractor: See attached email  
13. Approval / Concurrence (Needed prior to beginning work) 
 
      See Change Order signatures 
 
14.  Engineer’s Estimate: 
 
The Contractor was asked to provide a proposal of their cost, and they responded with a request of 
$40,000. See attached independent estimate performed by the Engineer, which validates the 
Contractor’s request of $40,000 as fair and equitable compensation.

Upon reviewing DC # 3 I noticed that the box has been checked that this change  has not affected the critical path. 
We disagree and would like to reserve our right to additional contract days.

RE:  
Initial Written Protest – Utility Conflicts 
90th Avenue NW Extension 
 
Fed Aid No. STPUS-9311(001) 
 
Dear Mr. Verbarendse, 
 
This letter is in response to your email dated April 27, 2020 wherein SRV states that “Pursuant to Section 
1-04.7 ‘Differing Site Conditions’, SRV has notified the Owner of several unforeseen conflicting utilities 
to date requiring design changes that are delaying the progress of the work. SRV reserves the right 
under the contract to request payment and/or additional working days for these delays.”  
Relative to your email, Design Change #03 was issued by the Engineer on April 23, 2020 (a revision to DC 
#01 issued on April 20, 2020) that addresses these conflicts, which I believe are limited to the time 
period between April 20, 21, 22 and 23.  
 
Under the requirements of 1-04.5 Procedure and Protest by the Contractor: 
• 
SRV’s provided notice of protest to the Project Engineer as required by 1-04.5(1) on April 27,

Subject: 90th Initial Written Protest 
 
Hi Steve; 
In Serial Letter SLStan-003, I stated being receptive to looking over components of 1-04.5(2) ahead of the written 
supplement to the protest under 1-04.5 regarding the sewer conflicts.  In that letter, I stated that your written 
supplement to the protest was due no later than May 11, 2020.  Subsequent to the initial protest, last Monday and 
Tuesday, another issue came up regarding a leaking waterline that flooded your work.  Via our discussion(s) I asked you 
to combine the two incidents into a dollar amount that David and I could evaluate and bring forth to the City.   On May 
7th, you offered $40,000 to settle the inefficacies due to the sewer line conflicts in the plans, and the leaking water 
line.  David and I intend to bring your offer forward next week and hope to get back to you shortly thereafter.  For the 
sake of the Contract requirements, I am pushing out the deadline for SRV to supplement the written protest.  if we come 
back to you with non-agreement of the $40,000, I will then start the 14 calendar day requirement over again at that 
time so that you can supply the remaining information of the written protest under 1-04.5(2) for the two incidents, 
sewer and water line conflict. 
Thanks

ISSUE 
The issue before the Council is for consideration and approval of Resolution 2020-07 
(Attachment F) the City of Stanwood Six-year Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP). 
The Council will open a Public Hearing to receive testimony regarding the proposed TIP 
and then consider approval of the resolution.  
SUMMARY STATEMENT 
The City of Stanwood is required by RCW 35.77.010 (ATTACHMENT A) to prepare and 
adopt a transportation improvement plan by July of each year for the ensuing six calendar 
years. The City of Stanwood’s Six Year Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) is required 
to be consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and filed with the Washington 
Department of Transportation as well as the Puget Sound Regional Council.  
DISCUSSION 
Staff reviewed the City’s existing Six Year TIP as well as future transportation 
improvement projects to update Stanwood’s Six Year TIP as required by RCW 35.77.010 
(ATT B & C). Staff discussed the issue with the Public Works Committee at their April 6 
and May 4, 2020 meetings as well as with full Council at their May 14, 2020 meeting.  
8-1
The purpose of the 6-Year TIP is to assure that each city and town shall perpetually have 
available advanced plans looking to the future for not less than six years as a guide in 
carrying out a coordinated transportation program.   
  
The approved plan may at any time be revised by a majority vote of the council, but only 
after a public hearing(s) has been noticed and held. Projects seeking grant or outside 
funding need to be identified on the 6-Year TIP.  
  
Most of the projects listed on the TIP were identified previously. The following table is a 
summary of the changes made to the current TIP.

FINANCIAL IMPACT  
  
There are no budget impacts or costs for development of the City’s TIP. Council 
understands that it is not a requirement to fund all projects that are listed on the TIP. 
However, the TIP provides the City with a project list establishing the necessary 
foundation for the City to apply for State and Federal grant opportunities as well as 
analyzing and developing budget allocations sufficient to plan, engineer, permit, purchase 
right of way, and construct the proposed improvements as funds become available in the 
future (Attachments D and E).  
  
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS  
  
The Six Year Transportation Improvement Plan was reviewed and discussed by the Public 
Works Committee on April 6, 2020 and May 4, 2020 and by full Council on May 14, 2020. 
Therefore, the recommendation is to hold a public hearing and adopt by resolution prior 
to the July deadline.   
  
CITY COUNCIL OPTIONS  
  
1) Hold the public hearing to take comment on the Six Year Transportation 
Improvement Plan 2021-2026 and approve Resolution 2020-07. 
  
2) Do not hold the public hearing, nor approve Resolution 2020-07 and return the 
issue to staff and/or the Public Works Committee for additional information, review, 
and revision before Jule 1, 2020 per RCW 35.77.010. The Six Year TIP must be 
filed with the secretary of transportation not more than thirty days after its adoption. 
The purpose of this RCW is to assure that each city and town shall perpetually 
have available advanced plans looking to the future for not less than six years as 
a guide in carrying out a coordinated transportation program.

ATTACHMENT – A  
 
RCW 35.77.010 
Perpetual advanced six-year plans for 
coordinated transportation program 
expenditures — Non-motorized 
transportation — Railroad right-of-way. 
 
(1) The legislative body of each city and town, pursuant to one or more public hearings thereon, 
shall prepare and adopt a comprehensive transportation program for the ensuing six calendar 
years. If the city or town has adopted a comprehensive plan pursuant to chapter 35.63 or 35A.63 
RCW, the inherent authority of a first-class city derived from its charter, or chapter 36.70A 
RCW, the program shall be consistent with this comprehensive plan. The program shall include 
any new or enhanced bicycle or pedestrian facilities identified pursuant to RCW 36.70A.070(6) 
or 
other 
applicable 
changes 
that 
promote 
non-motorized 
transit. 
 
The program shall be filed with the secretary of transportation not more than thirty days after its 
adoption. Annually thereafter the legislative body of each city and town shall review the work 
accomplished under the program and determine current city transportation needs. Based on these 
findings each such legislative body shall prepare and after public hearings thereon adopt a 
revised and extended comprehensive transportation program before July 1st of each year, and 
each one-year extension and revision shall be filed with the secretary of transportation not more 
than thirty days after its adoption. The purpose of this section is to assure that each city and town 
shall perpetually have available advanced plans looking to the future for not less than six years as 
a guide in carrying out a coordinated transportation program. The program may at any time be 
revised by a majority of the legislative body of a city or town, but only after a public hearing. 
 
The six-year plan for each city or town shall specifically set forth those projects and programs of 
regional significance for inclusion in the transportation improvement program within that region. 
 
(2) Each six-year transportation program forwarded to the secretary in compliance with 
subsection (1) of this section shall contain information as to how a city or town will expend its 
moneys, including funds made available pursuant to chapter 47.30 RCW, for non-motorized 
transportation 
purposes. 
 
(3) Each six-year transportation program forwarded to the secretary in compliance with 
subsection (1) of this section shall contain information as to how a city or town shall act to 
preserve railroad right-of-way in the event the railroad ceases to operate in the city's or town's 
jurisdiction.

SUBJECT:  
Organization Restructure and Updated Staffing Plan 
CONTACT PERSON:

C-Resolution 2020-08-Updating the Stanwood
Non-Represented Salary Schedule
D-FCS Report May 2020
ISSUE: 
The issue before the Council is to revise the overall staffing plan and organizational 
structure for the City of Stanwood organization and to approve or not a resolution 
revising the non-represented salary schedule. 
RECOMMENDATION: 
Staff recommends approval of Resolution 2020-08 
SUMMARY: 
In 2019, the City contracted with FCS Group to conduct an organizational assessment 
and long-term staffing plan that will better position the city organization to achieve 
strategic goals and deliver levels of service that the community desires. The proposed 
long-term staffing plan identifies the full list of positions that may be implemented over 
time and also identifies which positions are active or inactive. The first phased 
implementation of the staffing plan includes activating positions that immediately 
support the city’s ability to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiencies and 
enhance the employee’s experience, focus on talent by developing current employees 
from within and attracting new talent that adds to our goal of performance excellence. 
The FCS study was concurrent with the Community Survey conducted in late 2019 that 
identified key priorities and initiatives that the community desired. Organizational 
structure and staffing are key to delivering on strategic community initiatives. 
8-21
DISCUSSION: 
 
The FCS Workforce Assessment Study (See Attachment D, pages 3 and 4) the provide 
study findings, conclusions and recommendations. Attachments A1 & A2 include the 
revised Stanwood organization structure, A1 is reporting framework based and A2 is 
departmental function framework. The long-term staffing plan (See Attachment B) 
includes the long-term staffing (or position counts) potentially needed over time, current 
active FTEs, and revised FTEs, both active and inactive for the remainder of 2020. The 
new staffing plan framework was created to show transparency on the active vs non-
active FTES but also allows for flexibility for the Administration when a level of service 
need changes and FTEs may be activated or inactivated within the current budgetary 
allocation for salary and benefits.  
 
The following are proposed non-represented staffing changes in 2020: 
 
Human Resource Manager – This position is proposed to be filled immediately. 
Because internal support to our employee experiences and employee retention, along 
with our need to recruit talent to our organization is key to supporting our direct service 
departments to be better able to focus on delivery of services and to provide the Mayor 
and City Administrator with a staffing resource to handle day-to-day aspects of human 
resources and labor relations. 
 
Assistant to the Administrator (Communications Specialist) – This position is 
proposed to be filled by transferring Krista Hintz, currently in the Community 
Development Department Administrative Assistant position. The administrative assistant 
position would then be inactivated or remain unfilled until the department sees a need 
for this position. This Assistant to the Administrator position will serve in another critical 
internal support role to assist in our public engagement enhancements and will fill gaps 
in initiatives that need to be addressed which include strategic plan initiative, emergency 
management, city local magazine, continue website and social media enhancements 
and work on special projects that include grant opportunity assessment and pursuit of 
funding programs for economic development initiatives. 
 
Finance Manager – The position is proposed to be filled by transferring Wendy Corder-
Dowhower, currently in the Finance Department Sr. Accountant position and serving as 
co-interim Finance Director Position. The Sr. Accountant position would then be 
inactivated and or remain unfilled. With the new organization structure separation of the 
Finance Director/City Clerk position was identified as a way to create a better focus on 
the city finances and technology services. The City Clerk position activation may be 
addressed in the 2021-2022 biennial budget development process. The Finance 
Manager will oversee all accounting functions, enhance contract management, enhance 
grant management, develop automated processes and improve financial reporting for 
both internal departments and external customers. The Finance Director position is 
planned to remain inactive until the 2021-2022 biennial budget development. 
 
 
 
8-22
Public Works Superintendent – This position is one of two identified in the long-term 
staffing plan and is planned to be filled by the fourth quarter of 2020. In the past, this 
was a position within the organization structure and the classification is being revised. 
The position will be responsible for planning, organizing and supervising the day-to-day 
maintenance, repair and field operational work of the Public Works Divisions including 
streets, parks, utilities, facilities and fleet assets.  
 
City Engineer/Capital Project Manager – This position is proposed to be filled by 
transferring Shawn Smith, currently in the Public Works Department in the Assistant 
Public Works Director/City Engineer position. With the new organization structure, this 
position establishes a more defined engineering division that shifts to a priority focus on 
capital improvement projects, plan reviews and inspections consolidated for both private 
and public projects that have been processed through the Community Development 
Department. This position will continue to serves as the City’s registered professional 
Civil Engineer and assume the role of Public Works Director in his/her absence making 
critical decisions for the entire department. 
 
Engineering Technician – Field Inspections – This position proposed to be filled by 
the fourth quarter of 2020. The position reclassifies the Construction Inspector role, 
currently vacant but adds in additional responsibilities for both private and public 
projects. Engineering Technicians are positioned under the new division in the Public 
Works Department. 
 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
 
Finance staff has developed preliminary financial forecasts to assess and understand 
the impacts of implementation of the long-term staffing plan and first phase changes, 
coupled with the COIVD 19 pandemic challenges that have only heighted the need for 
realigning staffing resources. Salary and benefit allocations are authorized, along with 
other budgetary allocations, by the City Council through the adoption of a biennial 
budget and any subsequent budget amendments. The fiscal impact of the proposed 
changes do not require a 2020 budget amendment as there are current positions that 
would become inactive or remain vacant until later in the year. The table below shows 
the overall operating fund budgets for 2020 and the salary and benefit portions of those 
budgets compared to the year-end estimated actual salary and benefit expenditures 
planned to be incurred. The year-end estimate includes the changes to non-represented 
positions as a first step:

The new staffing plan “matrix” provides for flexibility to activate or inactivate positions as 
a one strategy for delivering the expected, enhanced levels of service. The staffing plan 
and salary schedule resolution for non-represented employees is the first step to 
incorporating the new organizational structure and modifications of our staffing 
resources.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The City engaged FCS GROUP in June 2019 to evaluate its workforce and its alignment to needs of 
the community. This engagement included:  
 Interviewing City management and staff; 
 Conducting an inter-jurisdictional comparison of job duties for similar position titles;  
 Comparing and contrasting organizational structures to neighboring and other communities 
that have similar contracted public safety services;  
 Identifying cities experiencing or currently undergoing a similar rate of growth; and  
 Evaluating City level of staffing to ensure alignment with current as well as future 
community level of service (LOS) needs.   
Concurrent with our analysis, the City contracted with Washington State University to conduct a 
citizen’s satisfaction survey to determine the quality of services received and to identify gaps and 
opportunities to improve the services residents were receiving.  The results of our work, along with 
the results from the community survey, presents a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the 
needs facing the City. Using this information, City leadership can outline an informed and thoughtful 
pathway to manage and grow the City’s workforce to meet the community’s needs. 
This report provides highlights and key findings from these bodies of work and outlines a strategic 
workforce assessment plan to align the City’s organizational structure, the size and make up of its 
workforce, to meet the needs of the community as identified by the citizen’s survey, City 
Management and staff, and Mayor and City Council’s vision. 
STUDY FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
The following outlines the findings, conclusions and recommendations of this study as well as those 
of the community survey:  
Community survey  
In general, Stanwood residents expressed priorities in the following areas: 
 
Economic development/business retention and recruitment – the community expressed need 
to support and retain existing businesses and attract new businesses, and in particular 
hotel/lodging, full-service restaurants, and outdoor recreation services. 
 
Parks, trails and open space – the community expressed a desire to enhance existing park 
assets and to enhance waterfront park and trails that can be used for multiple activities.  The 
community rated as a lower priority new parks that are dedicated to a single sport. The 
community expressed a strong desire for parks and recreation programs but the scope of these 
programs have yet to be determined. As the vision and scope of these services develop, it will 
need to be supported by full-time City staff and dedicated parks and recreation programs.

 
Transportation and Infrastructure Improvements -  – The community expressed need to focus 
on transportation and street improvements to ensure traffic capacity does not further impact 
the community, create better intersections and enhance the main street corridor.  
 
Communication – the community survey identified a need to enhance the City’s website and 
improve the content.  Specific needs included using multi-faceted ways to better inform 
residents of current City events and projects and to attract new businesses to locate in the 
City. 
City Staff Interviews Feedback 
In general, City staff and management expressed priorities in the following areas: 
Parks and Public Works 
 Additional Parks and Street maintenance staff, with additional staffing needed regardless of 
any new level or change in service. 
 Additional two (2) Public Works Supervisors to provide adequate oversight in the areas of all 
public works maintenance divisions.  
 Reclass City Engineer/Assistant Public Works Director position to provide capital projects 
strategic planning and oversight rather than day to day operations and personnel management. 
 Add Engineering Technicians to support plan review and inspections of both public and 
private development once the projects have completed the plan development process. 
 Add water and wastewater operator in training positions, by modifying the Public Works 
Tech III position to better define a pathway for certification and advancement in these 
technical, skilled positions. 
 Parks and recreation program staff to be determined as needs are identified with community 
input and parks are developed. 
Economic/Business Development 
 Add Economic Development Coordinator position to focus on business retention and 
recruitment efforts, along with coordination for the City’s tourism and marketing initiative: 
Discover Stanwood Camano  
Development and Planning Services 
 
Complete the GIS needs assessment to determine staffing needs for future mapping and GIS 
functions 
 
Add Code Compliance Officer to focus on enhanced responses to non-compliance with city 
code and regulations 
Administrative and Support Services 
 Add Human Resource position to focus on employee retention,  recruitment, and labor 
relations, as well as enhance the  overall employee experience. 
 Reclass Administrative Assistant to an Assistant to the Administrator position to focus on the

multi-faceted public engagement programs, pursuing grant opportunities and special projects 
under the direction of the City Administrator.

II. STAFFING ANALYSIS 
About the City of Stanwood 
The City of Stanwood (City) is the northernmost city in Snohomish County and is the only 
community servicing Camano Island, which is located directly west of the City.  The City operates 
under a mayor-council form of government with a strong mayor.  The Mayor serves as the City’s 
chief executive officer and the Council serves as the municipal legislature.  City services are 
currently provided by 31.0 FTEs and includes the following departments: Community Development, 
Public Works, Finance/City Clerk, and City Administration. Police and Fire services are contracted 
out to Snohomish County and the North County Regional Fire Authority, respectively.  Library 
services are contracted out to the Sno-Isle library system. The City contracts out for City Attorney 
and legal services with Snohomish Law Office. 
The City’s residential population totals 7,070, an increase of 13% since 2010 making it one of the 
fastest growing communities in Snohomish County. This compares to Everett (+9%), Edmonds 
(+6%), Lynnwood (+11%), Marysville (+13%), and Monroe (+13%)1.  A major challenge in the near 
future for the City will be developing and maintaining its parks and park facilities.  There is a strong 
community preference for focusing on transportation improvements, developing trail systems to 
create connectivity from one end of the City to the other as well as a regional connection.  Other 
major City initiatives include designing and constructing a new Civic Campus for Police, City Hall 
and Council Chambers; continuing to improve the City’s business climate and investment in tourism; 
and updating the City’s Comprehensive Plan and Shoreline Master Plan.  
Organizational Structure  
The City employs 31.6 FTEs.  Municipal services are provided under five separate departments each 
of which report to the City Administrator.   
 
Exhibit 1 below presents the City’s current organizational chart and Table 1 summarizes each City 
department budget and services. The current organizational chart only defines functions that the city 
departments provide and does not identify positions or reporting structure within the organization. 
There are missing functions within the current org chart, as well.

Community Survey 
In 2019, the City contracted with Washington State University to conduct a citizen’s satisfaction 
survey.  A detailed questionnaire was sent to a random selection of households in the City of 
Stanwood and the greater Stanwood and Camano Island area utilized an on-line survey feature to 
offer feedback.  This questionnaire asked respondents to rate their satisfaction with the level of city 
services received and their opinions on the local economy and general business climate. The 
following major themes were derived from the survey including suggestions for improvement from 
WSU. 
 
Table 2: WSU Community Survey Major Themes  
and Suggestions for Improvement 
Economic Development 
Major Themes 
Suggestions for Improvement 
 
Majority of respondents would like to see more hotels and lodging 
options for visiting relatives and family friends. 
 
 
Would like to see more full-service restaurants and more 
businesses that cater to outdoor recreation 
 
 
City does not do a good job retaining existing businesses or 
recruiting new businesses 
 
 
City does not have a vibrant downtown with a majority of 
respondents indicating that they complete their shopping outside 
of Stanwood. 
 
 
Utilize online resources to attract and recruit new businesses. 
 
 
Continue efforts to address business recruitment and retention 
including evaluating strategies utilized by other communities to 
recruit and retain businesses. 
 
 
Consider establishing a main street program from WA State that 
is designed to help communities revitalize their economies. 
 
 
Conduct a hotel/lodging feasibility study as planned. This study 
will evaluate strategies for recruiting more of these businesses to 
the City. 
 
 
Communication and Outreach 
Major Themes 
Suggestions for Improvement 
 
The majority of respondents have not visited the City’s websites in 
the past 12 months (discoverstandwoodcamano.com or 
ci.stanwood.wa.us) and may therefore be unaware of current 
events in the City. 
 
 
Of the respondents that did visit the City’s website, the majority 
used the website to primarily learn more about the City and to 
learn about events in the City.   
 
 
Other reasons respondents used the website include finding 
contact information for City officials or finding information on 
public meetings. 
 
 
Majority of respondents had limited knowledge of the City’s 
Transportation Benefit District or the projects funded by the TBD. 
 
 
Use multiple channels to communicate with residents and to 
improve awareness of current city activities, projects and services 
available. 
 
 
Redesign the City of Stanwood and Discover Stanwood Camano 
Websites to enhance user friendliness and visual appeal.     
 
 
Develop a strategy for social media-based communication to drive 
individuals to the City’s website. 
 
 
 
Parks and Recreation 
Major Themes 
Suggestions for Improvement 
 
The City should focus on improving existing parks and amenities 
as they rated the condition of the city’s parks as average. 
 
 
Respondents stated that they would like to see more waterfront 
parks and more hiking and biking trails and improved existing 
water parks and trails 
 
 
Respondents stated that their lowest priority were for developing 
more baseball/softball fields and developing more basketball 
courts. 
 
Develop new waterfront parks and trails and multi-use facilities. 
Once new facilities are developed, it will be important to ensure 
funding for on-going maintenance and upkeep. 
 
 
Enhance existing parks and communicate the amenities available 
to the public. Focus on completing existing parks and trails and 
not add new parks to the system.

completed for the City of Stanwood.  
Inter-jurisdictional Workforce Comparison 
Our workforce assessment included a workforce survey of neighboring communities similar in size 
and scope to Stanwood. The surveyed cities include: North Bend, Port Townsend, and Snohomish. 
We also surveyed the City of Yelm; however, Yelm never responded to our repeated attempts to 
contact them and were therefore excluded from this comparison. These cities were selected in 
conjunction with the City of Stanwood administration as these cities shared characteristics similar to 
Stanwood - ie, fast growing communities of similar population, demands on public services and 
similar park land. Each of these cities contract out its fire services with the exception of the City of 
Port Townsend  
 
Our survey included requesting job descriptions and duties for all positions. We then prepared a 
comparison of the job titles and general job duties.  
 
Themes that emerged from our comparative survey include: 
 
Table 3: Inter-jurisdictional Workforce Comparison 
Major Themes 
 
Stanwood does not have dedicated staffing in the area of Human Resources. For example, the City of Port Townsend employs 
a Human Resources Manager, Human Resources Specialist, and a Payroll/Benefits Administrator.  Having dedicated staff will 
ensure these areas receive the appropriate level of attention. In particular, having a dedicated staffing in the area of human 
resources can help support City staff as well as protect the City from risk and enhance the overall experience of a Stanwood 
employee. 
 
Stanwood does not have dedicated staffing in the area of economic development. For example, the City of North Bend has a 
Special Events and Visitors Information Coordinator and an Economic Development Manager and the City of Snohomish has an 
Economic Development and Communications Manager.  Having dedicated staff will ensure these areas receive the appropriate 
level of attention. In particular, having dedicated staffing in the area of economic development can support business retention and 
recruitment and promote the City and work towards building a more vibrant downtown. 
 
Stanwood does not have dedicated staffing for public engagement and communications. For example, the City of Snohomish 
includes a dedicated Communications Manager who’s responsibility is to Oversees content and updates to city’s external website, 
social media, and community television channel, oversee the production of the City of Snohomish Quarterly magazine, oversees 
external and internal messaging to citizens, community groups, media, external organizations, general public and city employees 
and assists other City departments with communications needs. 
 
Stanwood should consider having a maintenance operations supervisor each in the areas of Streets/Parks and Utilities. 
For example, the City of Port Townsend has a Public Works Operations Manager – Water Resources, Public Works Operations 
Manager – Streets/Sewer/Storm and a Public Works Operations Manager – Wastewater.  While Stanwood has Lead Maintenance 
Workers, these positions do not have supervisory responsibility. Having supervisory positions can help ensure field staff operations 
are coordinated and resources are deployed efficiently. In addition, if there are any workload management issues, these can be 
delegated appropriately to the supervisors for coordination and resolution and thereby reducing the amount of time wasted to a 
minimum.  
 
Stanwood should consider creating an Operator in Training classification for its Water Treatment Plant Operator and 
Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator classifications.  This classification will provide a clearer career path for its Operators and 
systematize the training and expectations of its Operators. 
 
Stanwood should consider revising its Public Works management structure so that there is an ability to apply greater 
management focus on the planning and execution of its CIP program and project management.  As the City of Stanwood 
continues to grow, it will be important that its CIP program is supported with the proper level of management focus and that the 
needs of the CIP does not become foreshadowed with daily operational needs.

Employee Comments 
Our workforce assessment included a survey of the City’s management team and on-site interviews 
with the City’s employees by job classification.  The management team survey was sent in early July 
2019 and the on-site interviews were held over a two-day period during the latter half of July.  For 
the interviews, where there were multiple employees holding the same job classification, those were 
held in a group setting, otherwise all interviews were conducted in a one-on-one setting.   
The following table summarizes our findings, conclusions and recommendations. 
 
Table 5: Employee Comments and Suggestions for Improvement 
Parks, Streets and Utility Maintenance and Operations 
Major Themes 
Suggestions for Improvement 
 
City staffing is not keeping pace with the changes in the 
community.  Specifically, the City’s maintenance staff is not 
sufficiently sized to keep pace with maintaining city parks, streets 
and utility assets.  As a result, maintenance duties are prioritized 
and programs are not properly staffed, placing the city’s assets at 
risk and potentially increasing the cost of maintenance in the long-
term. 
 
 
City staff expressed frustration that they are not able to operate 
as efficiently as they may be able to due to a shortage of vehicles. 
For example, employees must carpool and get dropped off at job 
sites. When work is completed at these sites, employees must call 
and wait for a ride to their next job site or to return to the shop.  
Rides might not come immediately as the driver may be in 
process of completing their work and is not able to immediately 
leave.  This waiting is inefficient and results in wasted time. 
 
 
City staff expressed frustration with using equipment that is old 
and not functioning optimally. This results in machinery 
breakdowns that either must be repaired on site or returned to the 
shop for repairs. This downtime is inefficient and results in wasted 
time. 
 
 
City supervisory staff are not sufficient to provide proper oversight 
of individuals and teams. As a result, existing work teams are not 
operating as optimally as they could be. 
 
 
 
Consider additional Parks and Streets maintenance staff to 
service and maintain these visible city assets. 
 
Assess and purchase additional vehicles needed so that staff can 
travel to job sites relatively efficiently and minimize the amount of 
time waiting.  
 
 
While the City has a vehicle and equipment replacement plan, the 
City should take this as an opportunity to strategically evaluate  
its overall needs and to revise/expand this plan for any additional 
vehicles or equipment that may be needed. 
 
 
Consider adding two new Public Works Supervisors (one for 
Parks & Streets and one for Utilities) to provide oversight of public 
works maintenance daily operations. 
 
 
 
Core Support Duties 
Major Themes 
Suggestions for Improvement 
 
Critical city functions such as Human Resources, Communications 
and Economic Development are not addressed with dedicated 
employees. Rather these functions are being provided by 
employees with other job duties or the City Administrator. As a 
result, these critical functions of the City may not be receiving the 
level of attention that is required. 
 
 
City finance staffing is insufficient. For example, staff time is 
focused on key duties of daily financial operations and the City is 
unable to provide proper support to the accounting and 
management of contracts. With the acceptance of more grants, 
the City should expect greater opportunities for single audits by 
the State Auditor’s Office and the need for staff to collate, 
organize and provide this information as needed to the Auditor.  
 
 
City management and strategic oversight of capital projects 
construction and planning is insufficient.  This insufficiency results 
 
Consider adding a Human Resources manager, a 
Communications Specialist or Assistant to the Administrator, and 
an Economic Development coordinator to provide dedicated 
support to these key functions. 
 
 
Consider adding a Accounting staff to  support the City’s 
monitoring of contracts, accounting of grants, and respond to and 
support audits, improve financial procedures and financial 
reporting.  
 
 
Consider adding a CIP Manager to support the citywide facilities, 
infrastructure, and parks and trails development projects and the 
overall execution of the City’s CIP. New and enhanced efforts to 
seek grants are the responsibility of the grant program manager.

in public works management focusing more time on the day to day 
operations of the Public Works department and less time to focus 
on the long-term, strategic capital construction needs of the City. 
 
 
Workforce - Historical and Forecast 
The following table summarizes the City’s historical 2008-2019 FTEs and how it has changed 
relative to the City’s residential population growth. As shown in the following table, the City’s FTEs 
have decreased over time from 43.2FTEs in 2008 to 31.0FTEs in 2019.  Over this same period, the 
City’s residential population has increased by 19.3% from 5,885 residents to 7,070 residents.  This 
divergence has resulted in a decline in the number of City FTEs per 1,000 population from 7.3FTEs 
to 4.5FTEs in 2019.  According to the City’s 2015 comprehensive plan, the city’s residential 
population is estimated to increase by about 2.6% annually and reach 11,080 residents by the year 
20353.  Assuming this annual rate of growth, with no changes in the number of City FTEs, in the next 
five years the number of City FTEs per 1,000 population will continue to decline to 3.8FTEs by the 
year 2024, as shown in table 7 below.

As the City of Stanwood grows, it will be important that its staffing grows commensurately and, at a 
minimum, does not fall below its 2019 level of service to the community and preferably begin to 
increase this level of service.  The following table outlines the proposed reclassification of existing 
FTEs and new FTEs to address the service level needs discussed above.

With these proposed changes, the City will be able to begin addressing the staffing and service needs 
as identified in the WSU community survey and in the interviews with City management and staff.  If 
the City were to make the proposed changes, within the next five years, the City’s FTE levels per 
1,000 population will return to approximately 2010 levels.

While adding these new positions will increase the City’s number of FTEs per 1,000 population, it 
will likely remain towards the lower end as compared to surveyed communities as the number of 
FTEs and residential population levels will grow over time.

III. SUMMARY 
As the City’s population increases and the demands upon its services becomes more diverse, it 
should take this opportunity to evaluate its current organizational structure and ensure its resources 
are efficiently aligned to meet the needs of the community.  Included in the report appendix are the 
City’s current city-wide organizational chart; organizational charts for the surveyed communities; 
and proposed long-term organizational and functional charts for the City of Stanwood, reflecting the 
suggested service level changes and the additional positions discussed above. 
 
By making these changes, the City would be able to build organizational capacity through a series of 
reclassifications and strategically timed new positions to address the needs as identified in the WSU 
survey and the employee interviews.  The updated organizational structure and staffing plan includes 
all positions and classifications. As the demand for levels of services changes, positions would be 
active or inactive. Funding for salary and benefits would be allocated and controlled by the biennial 
budget approved by the City Council.

Staffing Plan Implementation & Next Steps 
The new staffing plan is designed to be flexible and allow the Mayor and City Administrator the 
ability to utilize approved positions within the adopted budgets for salaries and benefits in a more 
efficient manner. To implement, staff will bring a salary plan resolution to the City Council for 
consideration. Staffing changes are anticipated to position the City for long-term recovery from the 
COVID 19 Pandemic, so that we may invest in our local economy. We have talent and skills in our 
existing staff that will be best utilized in alternative positions, through reclassification, as well as 
desperately need to activate new positions to fill gaps needed to support the organization and 
strategic efforts for service delivery to the community.

COUNCIL AGENDA STAFF REPORT 
ITEM NUMBER:      
8c 
DATE:         
     June 11, 2020 
SUBJECT:       
Authorize the Mayor to sign a task order with The Blueline 
Group, LLC to provide plans, specifications, and estimates 
(PS&E) for the 101st Ave. NW Reconstruction Project.  
CONTACT PERSON: 
Kevin Hushagen, Public Works Director 
ATTACHMENTS:      
A – Task Order 
ISSUE 
The issue in front of council is whether or not to authorize the Mayor to sign a task order 
with The Blueline Group, LLC to provide PS&E for the 101st Ave. NW Reconstruction 
Project. 
SUMMARY STATEMENT 
This project is planned to reconstruct 101st Ave. NW from a narrow, 2-lane road with 
gravel shoulders, intermittent sidewalks and a substandard drainage system, to a 
current standard city road with curb, gutter, sidewalks and drainage system.   
DISCUSSION 
In the wet months of each year, 101st Ave. NW and many adjacent properties have 
significant standing water and other related water issues.  There are only sporadic 
sidewalk sections, so pedestrians need to walk in the roadway, including Stanwood 
Elementary students.  This project will reconstruct the road to provide sidewalks on both 
sides and improve the drainage system for the connecting properties.  101st Ave. NW 
also serves as a potential future connection to Heritage Park from the west side of the 
newly acquired property to expand the park.   
This project also contains a new walkway along 273rd Pl. NW to allow the many children 
that walk from Josephine’s Childcare facility to Stanwood Elementary.   
This project is for PS&E, however, grant funding will be sought throughout this process, 
including CDBG and Safe Routes to School.

FINANCIAL IMPACT 
 
The contract amount is not to exceed $309,980.  There is $250,000 budgeted in the 
drainage fund. The street capital improvement fund includes $250,000 for a project that 
will not be completed this year.  A budget amendment will be required.

Attention: Ken Lauzen, P.E. 
Subject: 
Geotechnical Engineering Scope of Work 
 
101st Avenue NW Reconstruction 
 
Stanwood, Washington  
 
Dear Ken: 
As requested, HWA GeoSciences Inc. (HWA) is pleased to present this proposed scope and 
budget for geotechnical services associated with the 101st Avenue NW Reconstruction project in 
Stanwood, Washington.  This scope of work is based on our understanding of the project and our 
conversations with Blueline. 
PROJECT UNDERSTANDING 
 
It is our understanding that the City of Stanwood plans to complete roadway and utility 
improvements along 101st Avenue from 271st St NW to 102nd Ave NW (following 274th Pl NW 
around at the north) and 273rd Pl NW from 102nd Ave NW to 100th Ave NW.  Based on our 
understanding of the project objectives, HWA proposes the following geotechnical engineering 
services scope of work for the project. 
 
GEOTECHNICAL SERVICES SCOPE 
The proposed work will include the following tasks: 
 
Geotechnical Project Setup: 
• Project Setup:  HWA will initiate the project and set up billing information in support of 
invoicing throughout the project. 
• Collect and Review Available Geotechnical Data:  HWA will review readily available 
geotechnical information along the project corridor.  This review will include online 
geotechnical databases, geologic maps and HWA library. 
 
 
 
8-79
Geotechnical Field Exploration Program: 
• Coordinate and Plan the Geotechnical Exploration Field Work:  HWA will plan and 
coordinate with the City, design team, and subcontractors to conduct one day of 
geotechnical explorations in support of the design and construction of the project. 
• Generate Geotechnical Explorations Work Plan Memo: HWA will prepare a 
Geotechnical Work Plan Memorandum for the proposed exploration work consisting of 
one day of geotechnical drilling.  HWA anticipates drilling five to six borings to a depth 
of 10 to 15 feet below ground surface during one day of drilling.  The work plan will be 
submitted to the design team and the City for review and approval.  The work plan will 
detail the type, location, and extent of proposed field explorations along with logistics 
necessary to perform the work such as traffic control plans and staging areas.  The work 
plan will also be used for utility locating clearances and for permitting that may be 
necessary to access the exploration locations.  We assume the City and/or Blueline in 
support of this project, will acquire and provide any required permits or right of entries at 
no cost to HWA. 
• Conduct Utility Locates: Once prior to finalizing exploration plans and once prior to 
conducting our field exploration program, HWA will mark the proposed exploration 
locations and arrange for utility locates using the Utility Notification Center.  HWA may 
be required to make an additional site visit to mark and verify the proposed drilling 
locations if the initial utility locate tickets are expired prior to mobilizing the drilling 
equipment.  HWA will also utilize private utility locates on the day of drilling to further 
assure the clearance of boring locations from any buried utilities. 
• Conduct Geotechnical Explorations: HWA will conduct one day of geotechnical 
explorations consisting of drilling five to six geotechnical borings to depth of 10 to 15 
feet below ground surface along the project alignment to assess the subsurface soil and 
groundwater conditions.  HWA anticipates conducting the proposed explorations will 
require traffic control measures consisting of single lane closure with alternating flagger 
controlled one-way traffic.  One boring will constructed as a groundwater monitoring 
well.  A groundwater monitoring transducer will be installed within the well to collect 
groundwater levels every 30 minutes.  
• Generate Boring Logs and Assign Laboratory Testing: HWA will prepare summary 
boring logs and perform laboratory testing to evaluate relevant physical properties of the 
soils encountered in our explorations. 
• Groundwater Monitoring:  HWA will make up to two site visits to download 
groundwater data from the transducer.  This data will be plotted to provide perspective 
contractors with anticipated groundwater levels.  
 
8-80
Geotechnical Engineering Design Services: 
• Evaluate Geotechnical Explorations Field and Laboratory Data: Based on the 
borings and the laboratory test results of selected samples, HWA will generate estimates 
of the soil strength and other properties needed to evaluate the effects the subsurface 
conditions will have on the proposed improvements. 
 
• Geotechnical Engineering:  HWA will evaluate the surface features and available 
subsurface data for the corridor to provide general geotechnical engineering 
recommendations including utility subgrade recommendations, roadway base 
stabilization, and pavement design.  HWA assumes that a robust subgrade aggregate 
section will be required to address anticipated soft subgrade soils.  
• Project Coordination Meetings:  HWA will participate in up to one (1) project 
coordination meeting at the City of Stanwood Offices.   
• Prepare Geotechnical Engineering Report: HWA will prepare a draft geotechnical 
report for the project.  This report will include descriptions of the site reconnaissance, 
geotechnical explorations, maps showing the location of existing subsurface data, and 
generalized geotechnical recommendations.  This report will be finalized upon receiving 
review comments. 
Project Management 
• Invoice Generation and Processing: HWA will prepare monthly invoices, and progress 
reports for the duration of the design phase of the project.   
• Geotechnical Task Management: HWA will provide task management to all 
geotechnical related aspects of the project.  HWA will correspond with the City and the 
design team in the form of meetings, emails, fax, and telephone calls, as necessary. 
ASSUMPTIONS 
• The geotechnical explorations proposed herein will not be used to assess site 
environmental conditions.  However, visual or olfactory observations regarding potential 
contamination will be noted.  Analysis, testing, storage, and handling of potentially 
contaminated soil and ground water (either sampled or spoils from drilling) are beyond 
this scope of services.  If contaminated soils and/or ground water are encountered, the 
material will be properly contained on-site for disposal as mutually agreed upon without 
additional cost to HWA. 
• All non-contaminated drilling spoils and related debris will be drummed on site and 
transported off site for disposal by the drilling subcontractor. 
• HWA will be responsible for all post drilling clean up. 
 
8-81
• No geotechnical data report or baseline report will be generated as part of this work. 
• No Phase 1 or Phase 2 Environmental Site Assessment will be completed by HWA. 
• All required street use permits will be provided by the City at no cost to HWA. 
• All geotechnical borings conducted through the pavement will be patched with quick 
setting cement.  Saw cutting of the pavement or hot mix asphalt patches will not be 
required. 
• All Geotechnical Explorations will be completed during daylight hours. 
• The borehole locations will be surveyed by others. 
• The groundwater monitoring well will be decommissioned by the contractor during 
construction.  
• No uniform police officer will be required for traffic control implementation during the 
exploration program. 
• No stormwater infiltration analysis will be competed due to anticipated fine grained soils. 
• HWA will not be required to attend a project kick off meeting 
• HWA reserves the right to transfer hours and budget dollars between tasks, labor and 
direct costs within the overall budget, as necessary to satisfy project requirements.

CITY OF STANWOOD 
COUNCIL AGENDA STAFF REPORT 
ITEM NUMBER:      
8d 
DATE:         
     June 11, 2020 
SUBJECT:       
Authorize the Mayor to approve the SR 532 Flood 
Berm/Stanwood Port Susan Trail-Phase 1 Change Order for 
Fencing and Hand Rail 
CONTACT PERSON: 
Kevin Hushagen, Public Works Director 
ATTACHMENTS:   
A. Hand Rail Detail
ISSUE 
The issue in front of council is whether or not to authorize the Mayor to approve the SR 
532 Flood Berm/Stanwood Port Susan Trail-Phase 1 Change Order to replace the chain 
link fence with a decorative fencing and hand rail system. 
DISCUSSION 
The Stanwood Port Susan Trail portion of this project was designed and bid with a 
black, four foot chain link fence for pedestrian protection.  This project is the first phase 
of a much larger Stanwood-Port Susan Trail project.  It will also be the most visible 
section, since it is directly adjacent to SR 532.  Discussion regarding the aesthetics of 
chain link fencing along the city’s trail system, prompted staff to request a quote from 
the contractor for decorative fencing and hand rail.  The quote is for an additional 
$88,716 over the cost of the chain link fencing.   
The Stanwood Port Susan Trail will extend around the Wastewater Treatment Plant, to 
Hamilton Park, then to Ovenell Park, and then around to Heritage Park, creating a loop 
trail around town.  This project is the first phase of this system and also the most visible 
to the public.  Thought needs to be given to what we want this trail system to look like.   
FINANCIAL IMPACT 
The engineer’s estimate was $882,000 and the awarded contract to Faber Construction 
was for $782,783.  The overall project budget is $900,000.  If this change is approved, it 
will fit within the project budget, therefore a budget amendment will not be required. 
8-89
The total for this change order is $88,716.  The contract amount is for $782,783.  This 
would bring the contract amount to $871,499, under the budgeted amount of $900,000.  
 
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION 
 
The public works committee was informed of the change order and recommended 
bringing this to full council for discussion. 
 
CITY COUNCIL OPTIONS 
 
1.   
Authorize the Mayor to approve a change order with Faber Construction, not to 
exceed $88,716. 
 
2.  
Do not authorize the Mayor to approve a change order with Faber Construction, 
not to exceed $88,716 and direct staff to areas of concern.  
 
 
RECOMMENDED MOTION 
 
I MOVE TO AUTHORIZE THE MAYOR TO APPROVE A CHANGE ORDER WITH 
FABER CONSTRUCTION, NOT TO EXCEED $88,716.
