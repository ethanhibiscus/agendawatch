Texpool is a local government investment pool.  The 
primary objectives of the pool are to preserve capital 
and protect principal, maintain sufficient liquidity, 
provide safety of funds and investments, diversify to 
avoid unreasonable or avoidable risks, and maximize 
the return on the pool.  The pool seeks to maintain a 
$1.00 value per share as required by the Texas Public 
Funds Investment Act.  Texpool investments consist 
exclusively of U.S. Government securities, repurchase 
agreements 
collateralized 
by 
U.S. 
Government 
securities, and AAA-rated no-load money market 
mutual funds.  Texpool is rated AAAm  by Standard & 
Poor’s, the highest rating a local government 
investment pool can achieve.  The weighted average 
maturity of the portfolio is limited to 60 days 
calculated using the reset date for variable rate notes 
("VRNs") and 90 days or fewer using the final maturity 
date for VRNs, with the maximum maturity for any 
individual security in the portfolio not exceeding 397 
days for fixed rate securities and 24 months for VRNs.  
Through our depository bank, BTH, City funds are  in 
an interest bearing account, with pledged securities 
for collateral.  Per the depository contract, interest is 
an earnings credit rate at the fed funds rate, adjusted 
the first busines day each month with a floor of 0.50%.  
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
Receive written investment report.  No formal action 
required.

Economic Overview
3/31/2020
Due to COVID-19 pandemic concerns, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) dramatically reduced the Fed Funds target range to 0.00% to 0.25% (Effective Fed Funds are trading +/-
0.10%).  Worldwide economic activity has collapsed because of Coronavirus "social isolation" and other related actions. The Yield Curve plummeted.  Crude oil declined severely to less than $25 per 
barrel.  Unemployment claims leaped to over 10 million.  The Stock Market "corrected" into a full bear market.  U.S. monetary and fiscal programs are designed to stabilize and improve near term 
economic conditions.  Time will tell how long the pandemic lasts and full recovery takes.

FUTURE LAND USE: 
The Comprehensive Plan designates this area for Low Density Residential (LDR). 
STAFF COMMENTS: 
The applicant is requesting a rezone from Agriculture (A) and Planned Development – 
General Retail to Single Family (SF-4) to create a neighborhood for single family homes.  A 
portion of this property is already zoned Single Family (SF-4). This portion is located directly 
south of the request and has frontage along Spring Hill Road. 
The subject property was annexed in 1980. When annexation occurs, the property that is 
annexed is automatically assigned an Agricultural (A) zoning designation. In 1983, there was 
a rezone request for General Retail, Multifamily, and Single Family (SF-4) to develop this 
area prior to the George Richey Road expansion. This property was included in the request. 
Since then, some of this area has been used to construct Spring Hill High School and their 
facilities.

George Richey Road is maintained by TXDOT and is a principal arterial roadway.  Principal 
arterial roadways serve major centers of metropolitan areas and provide a high degree of 
mobility.  They are designed to service relatively high traffic volumes, have high operational 
speeds, and service a significant portion of through travel.  This type of development is 
31
appropriate along this roadway, as long as access management is followed.  No access from 
lots will be allowed onto George Richey Road. 
Staff finds the proposed zoning change is consistent with future land use map and 
surrounding uses.   
STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 
The Planning and Zoning Commission (8-0) and Staff recommend approval for this request.

APPLICANT:  
 
Alan J. Robertson 
HISTORIC NAME: 
Whaley House 
LOCATION: 
101 East Whaley Street 
REQUEST: 
 
Local Historic Landmark Designation 
 
COUNCIL DISTRICT:   
District 3 – Council Member Wray Wade 
 
STAFF COMMENTS: 
The applicant is requesting a Local Historic Landmark Designation for the Whaley House. This 
will be Longview’s ninth local landmark if approved.   
 
This building is located in the downtown and is addressed as 101 East Whaley Street. This 
building is included on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated as a Recorded 
Texas Historic Landmark (RTHL). The Whaley House was built in phases. The first phase of the 
building was constructed as a residence for Franklin Lucilius Whaley in 1871. Several additions 
occurred from the 1870s to the 1950s which included projecting rooms added to bookend front 
porch, a detached kitchen incorporated into the house, dining room addition, replacement of 
original front porch columns and balustrades, wooden steps replaced with concrete, pantry 
converted into bathroom, shutters and kitchen chimney removed, floor furnace installed, and front 
entry sidelights and transom were painted and scored. The last of the construction was 
completed in the 1980s as it was restored to the 19th century appearance.  
 
The Whaley House was built for Franklin Lucilius Whaley and his descendants in 1871.  F.L. 
Whaley and his wife were founding members of First Baptist Church of Longview, which is also a 
Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. Mr. Whaley was a hardware merchant and was later elected 
mayor of Longview in 1891. Whaley Street, which runs through the “One Hundred Acres of 
Heritage,” the original Longview townsite, is named for F. L. Whaley.  
 
According to local legend, the Whaley House was the fourth house to be built in the newly platted 
town of Longview. The Victorian ornamentation and its size were part of the reason it was 
considered the showplace of town in the 1870’s. Prior to completion of the Gregg County Court 
House in 1876, Mr. Whaley held Gregg County’s first court in the second story of his hardware 
store, where it continued to convene until the courthouse was completed. It is believed that the 
Whaley House is currently one of the oldest standing structures in Longview. The building was 
occupied by the Whaley family until 1979, when it was purchased for use as a law office and has 
continued to function as a law office since then. 
 
This property was surveyed as part of the 2016 Historic Resources Survey.  It is listed as a high 
priority in the survey.  It is eligible to be listed individually and is a contributing structure.   
 
Local Historic Landmarks must meet one or more of the criteria listed in section 26-105, Criteria 
for Designation of a Local Historic Landmark.  The Whaley House meets several of these criteria.  
Such as possessing significance with respect to the history, culture and social fabric of Longview.  
The Whaley House is identified with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the
