Matt Wright, Acting Asst. Director Community Development, stated that the 
applicant is requesting to construct a new single-family house at 1605 SW 
Smith Street. This location is in the Historic and Downtown District.  
 
Mr. Wright stated that this is a single-story home with a basement, and it does 
meet the height restrictions for the Downtown Development Code. There is 
a minimum setback of 10ft. on the front yard and 5ft. for the side and rear. 
There will be three parking spaces with a side loaded attached garage. There 
is a minimum of 10% masonry required, and that has been met with 13.2% 
of the total of the façade having a brick or stone veneer which will be located 
on the front and side elevations adjacent to the front porch. There are no 
accessory structures proposed at this time. The applicant will be required to 
meet the minimum landscaping requirements which would include, one or 
two street trees depending on the type of tree, and ten front yard plantings.  
 
Mr. Wright stated that the lot is platted and is part of the Mock Addition 
which was platted in the late 1800’s – early 1900’s. Mr. Wright stated that 
possibly a house was built on the lot at one time.  
 
Mr. Wright displayed the building elevations and informed the Board that 
there is a recessed front porch off to the side of the garage and that is similar 
to other homes on that block. Mr. Wright stated that they don’t have any 
concerns with the side loaded garage. The homeowner currently owns the 
home to the west as well, and they will share the driveway, which is permitted 
under the code.  Staff does recommend that if the owner does decide to sell 
one or both homes that they record an access easement. That would guarantee 
that both houses would have access to the driveway in the future.  
 
Mr. Wright stated that the total square footage of the house is slightly under 
3,000, and that does include a full finished basement. Staff agrees that this 
meets all requirements of the Downtown Development Code and therefore 
recommends approval.

Kay Murphy, Owner / Applicant  
Ms. Murphy was present to answer any questions and she stated that she will 
retrieve an access easement for the driveway. 
 
Board Member Ken Billups Jr. questioned the driveway and the shared 
parking. Ms. Murphy stated that there is no garage on the existing house. A 
family member lives in that house. Mr. Murphy went on to say the reason 
that she is adding a three-car garage to the new house is so that her family 
member can park in the garage. Mr. Billups had concerns with the driveway 
width, because currently it’s not wide enough for two cars.  Ms. Murphy 
stated that she could have plans drawn up with a wider driveway so that two 
cars could be parked side by side. Mr. Wright stated that she would be 
allowed to do that, there are some restrictions of the width of a driveway but, 
even with those restriction she would be under that width requirement.  
 
Mr. Wright stated that the lot line can be shifted and approved 
Administratively by staff as long as the lot line doesn’t shift any further west. 
The applicant must maintain a 5ft. setback on the existing house.  
    
Board Member Ken Billups Jr. made a motion to approve DRB-03-20-7268 
for a new single-family house to be located at 1605 SW Smith Street and to 
explore the options of moving the lot line so that the driveway can be on one 
lot.

the voting members present above. Cindy Miller, Chairperson, called the 
meeting to order at 4:00 p.m. 
 
Matt Wright, Acting Asst. Director Community Development, stated that the 
applicant would like to add a new building addition to an existing house at 
1802 SW Walnut Street. The applicant is proposing a 450-sf. rear addition to 
the existing home, which is currently 800-sf. 
 
Mr. Wright stated that on March 26th the Historic Preservation Commission 
met to review the fireplace that is located on the property. There were some 
code violations along with structural issues regarding the fireplace. The HPC 
did approve the removal of the fireplace and to infill that area with new walls 
and siding that matches the existing siding of the home.

There are two applicable Downtown Development Code requirements, which 
would include the height and area requirements as well as building materials. 
 
The applicant provided building plans showing the addition and the plan 
meets all setback requirements. The addition will be single-story which 
matches the single-story existing house. Staff would recommend that the 
material match the existing house.  
 
Chairperson Miller asked if the chimney had been removed.  
 
John Curry, Applicant 
Mr. Curry stated that the chimney has not been removed yet. Mr. Curry stated 
that there is water damage on the back side of the roof and a fair amount up 
where the chimney fastens to the house on the front that will have to be 
replaced. Mr. Curry stated that he will replace the roof when he adds the 
addition. The existing house is 793-sf.  
 
Mr. Wright stated that the HPC will met at 5:00 p.m. today to discuss the 
project.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION / SUMMARY: 
The applicant, Christian Moreno of Santa Maria Group Corp., is requesting to rezone a 0.33 +/- 
acre property from “T5” (Urban Center) to “T3” (Sub-Urban) in the Downtown Zoning District. The 
property is located at 622 NW Lakeview Road, which is located on the south side of NW Lakeview 
Road approximately 100-ft. east of NW 7 Highway. The property was originally developed as a 
single-family house before being converted to a commercial daycare in 2004. The applicant is 
requesting to reconvert the building into a single-family house. Single-story single-family 
residential is only permitted in the “T3” zoning district in the Downtown Zoning District.  
PREVIOUS ACTIONS / APPROVALS: 
 
The East Lakeview Addition, 1st Plat was approved by the Board of Alderman on July 2, 
1956 (Ord. No. 178).  
 
On January 12, 2004, Planning Commission approved a Conditional Use Permit (CU-1-
2004) for “The Learning Gardens” commercial daycare on the subject property. 
 
On January 12, 2004, Planning Commission approved a Site Plan Design Review (SPD-
03-2004) for “The Learning Gardens” commercial daycare on the subject property.  
 
On March 26, 2007, Planning Commission recommended approval of a Rezoning (R-13-
2007) from “GB” (General Business) to “T5” (Urban Center) as part of the implementation 
and rezoning of the Downtown Zoning District. The City Council approved the Rezoning 
on April 2, 2007 (Ord. No. 4057). 
 
FUTURE APPLICATIONS / REVIEWS ANTICIPATED OR REQUIRED: 
The property must be rezoned prior to reconversion into a single-family residence. Some minor 
building code safety items (smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detector) will need to be 
installed prior to occupancy.

SPECIAL INFORMATION 
 
Comprehensive  
Plan: 
According to the 2014 Comprehensive Plan, “the Future Land Use Policy Map 
reflects planned future land uses at the most generalized and city-wide scale. The 
intent of the Future Land Use Policy Map is not to predetermine land uses or zoning 
on a specific parcel or at specific locations. Together with other elements of the 
Comprehensive Plan, the Future Land Use Policy Map should be used to guide 
the relationships and physical improvements needed to create the types of places 
that are part of Blue Springs’ long-range vision.” 
The Future Land Use Policy Map designates the subject property as a “Distinct 
Destination,” which may include a mix of land uses and defined as: 
A mix of larger-scale and regionally significant land uses that are different 
from other places in Blue Springs and the region. These areas may include 
a mix of retail, service/entertainment, office, institutional/civic or light 
industrial land uses, but a unique land use policy for each area emphasizes 
different uses, patterns and characteristics that make the destinations 
distinct. The scale and intensity of development in these areas requires a 
supporting system of street networks, pedestrian circulation and civic/open 
spaces to strengthen the destination and create a defined focal point as a 
catalyst for development. 
According to the 2014 Comprehensive Plan, “Specific Plans are detailed, area-
specific perspectives of the patterns and coordination of the built and natural 
environment, and how these details contribute to unique places in Blue Springs. 
These plans offer a more refined and location-specific application of the Policies, 
Goals, and Targets of the General Plan to a particular context.” 
The C2 Area’s Specific Plan designates the subject property as “General 
Commercial” which are areas primarily for larger scale non-retail service or office 
uses, or for retail uses that cannot easily be accommodate in or are not compatible 
with mixed-use areas. 
Zoning: 
The current and requested zoning is within the Downtown Zoning District, which 
includes subclassifications called “transect zones” (T-Zones). As defined by the 
Downtown Development Code, T-Zones differ from conventional zoning districts 
in that they are inherently mixed use and place more emphasis on design that 
building use. The different T-Zones establish a variety of scales, intensities and 
characteristics to account for the differing conditions in the plan area.  
 
Project: 622 NW Lakeview Road 
 
Case: RZ-05-20-7335  
 
Page 4 of 5 
 
The “T5” (Urban Center) definition accommodates a denser, mixed-use context, 
typically located near the center of a pedestrian shed or as a corridor along 
important thoroughfares. Typical building types within the “T5” zoning district 
include multi-family buildings, mixed-use, live/work, and civic buildings. 
 
The “T3” (Sub-Urban) definition accommodates the most natural, least dense, 
most residential context of a community. Typical building types within the “T3” 
zoning district include single-family and accessory units. Two-family building types 
may be permitted with Conditional Use Permit approval. 
REVIEW CRITERIA: 
In reviewing any application for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map (zoning change), the 
Planning Commission and City Council shall review the proposed amendment considering the 
Comprehensive Plan, the general requirements of the Unified Development Code, and the 
following considerations: 
1. The application is in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and any official plan of 
program developed under the guidance of the Comprehensive Plan, and in particular 
the relationship of land uses within the proposed district and the relationship with uses 
existing or anticipated in surrounding districts. 
STAFF RESPONSE: The existing building was originally built in the late 1950s-
early 1960s as a single-family residence and remained a residence until a 
Conditional Use Permit was approved for a commercial daycare in 2004. As 
far as staff can tell the subject property has always been zoned commercial 
due to its proximity to 7 Highway. However, the houses on either side of the 
property have been maintained as single-family residences over the past 60 
years, despite being zoned “GB” and/or “T5.” The existing single-family 
residences are all legal non-conforming uses within their respective zoning 
districts. Therefore, although the proposed “T3” zoning district will not match 
that of adjacent properties, the land use would be in keeping with adjacent 
properties.  
 
2. The application furthers the intent of the proposed zoning district and supports that of 
any abutting zoning districts. 
STAFF RESPONSE: The existing building was originally built as a single-
family residence is proposed to be reconverted to a residence. The proposed 
zoning district is in keeping with the existing land uses and land uses that are 
likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The Downtown Zoning District also 
encourages a mix of land uses within close proximity to one another. 
 
3. The precedents that might result from approval or denial of the application, and the 
possible effects of such precedents on the character of the area, and in particular the 
building form, site design, and other development patterns and urban design aspects 
that accompany precedents for the proposed district. 
STAFF RESPONSE: The rezoning is intended to accommodate the 
reconversion of a single-family house and make it a legal use, rather than a 
legal non-conforming land use as is the case with the adjacent residences. 
This could potentially set a precedent for the adjacent properties to rezone to 
“T3” in the future. However, the proposed rezoning would not impact the 
development characteristics of the subject property or adjacent properties, as 
 
Project: 622 NW Lakeview Road 
 
Case: RZ-05-20-7335  
 
Page 5 of 5 
it has been developed and predominately utilized as a single-family residential 
block for 60 years. 
 
4. Compliance of any proposed development with the requirements of the UDC. 
STAFF RESPONSE: The current building was likely built under the standard 
single-family residential requirements (most closely aligned with the “SF-7” 
zoning or Detached House-Neighborhood Lot building type requirements). 
Standards for single-family residences in the “T3” zoning district have smaller 
setbacks and generally more restrictive requirements for accessory structures 
and parking/garage locations. The existing building may have some legal non-
conformities that cannot be expanded upon without bringing the building into 
closer compliance with the current “T3” zoning district requirements. 
 
5. The ability of the City or other government agencies to provide any services, facilities 
or programs that might be required if the application were approved. 
STAFF RESPONSE: Staff believes this rezoning will not reduce the ability of 
the City or other government agencies to provide service, facilities, or 
programs. 
 
6. The effect of approval on the condition or value of property in the City or in the vicinity, 
including the likelihood of surrounding areas to be developed in accordance with the 
Comprehensive Plan. 
STAFF RESPONSE: Staff believes approval of this rezoning will not impact 
values of adjacent properties as it does not accommodate a land use that is 
out of character for the block, which is predominantly single-family, even 
though some lots are zoned for commercial uses. 
 
7. The requested zoning change is justified by a change in conditions since the existing 
zoning was designated or by an error in the current designation. 
STAFF RESPONSE: As previously mentioned, based on historical zoning 
maps staff believes the subject property has always been zoned commercial 
despite it being originally developed as a single-family residence.  
 
8. The consistency of the application with other adopted policies of the City. 
STAFF RESPONSE: Staff believes this proposal is consistent with other 
adopted City policies. 
 
9. The recommendations of professional staff. 
STAFF RESPONSE: Staff recommends approval of this rezoning proposal. 
 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 
Staff believes that the rezoning request is consistent with the review criteria noted above 
and as such staff recommends approval of the rezoning application. 
The Downtown Review Board and Planning Commission must make a recommendation to 
the City Council to approve or deny the rezoning application.
