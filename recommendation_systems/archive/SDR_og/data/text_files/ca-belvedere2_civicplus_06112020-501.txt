SCHEDULED ITEMS

Approve minutes of the January 29, 2020 regular meeting
●

Old Business
●
The Committtee discussed its on-going work on street reviews for traffic safety and
circulation, including reports from teams working on review of sidewalks/crosswalks,
parking 
and 
choke 
point 
issues, 
and 
speed 
limits/traffic 
calming.
•
Mayor Kemnitzer reported on the work done by the team looking into sidewalk
and crosswalk issues in order to make Belvedere a safe and walkable community.
She reviewed the team’s work and suggestions for where new crosswalks and
sidewalks might be added, and areas where sidewalk repair is indicated. She noted
the city should use a consultant to make final recommendations to comply with
various regulations.

•
Paul Falzone reported on the on-going work by the team looking at parking spot
and choke point issues on Belvedere Island. The team is reviewing and measuring
all the existing parking spots and proposed new spots in consultation with Police
Chief Wu to determine if any action should be taken to improve choke points and
ensure fire department access on the Island. This work is ongoing and the team
will report back with any specific recommendations at later meetings.
•
Chair Kyrouz reported on work by the team looking at speed and traffic calming
measures. The team members met with Chief Wu and the city attorney to discuss
options and determined that changing speed limits would not make sense under
current California law, but those laws are in flux and the committee could review
the issue again in the future. The team suggested that traffic safety could be
improved on the main access roads around the Island by painting two way arrows
to indicate cars travel in both directions. The team suggested painting these arrows
on Beach Road, Belvedere Ave and Golden Gate Ave at the junctures with other
streets to ensure visitors understand the roads are two-way. In addition, the team
noted that several other intersections have been identified by the committee for
possible traffic calming measures, which would require consultation with a traffic
engineer, and that work is ongoing.
●
The committee noted that additional items for maintenance and related work have been
referred to the city manager and staff and will be reviewed at future meetings. Police
Chief Wu reported back on his staff’s review of some of the areas where additional
parking and traffic enforcement may be needed.
3.
New Business
●
The committee discussed the question referred to the committee by the City Council
regarding whether the 72 hour parking rule should be amended. Chair Kyrouz asked Chief
Wu to explain the current code provisions and process for enforcement. Chief Wu
explained how the rule works, some of the challenges that stem from lack of definition in
the current code and how people are able to circumvent the rule to avoid enforcement.
Chief Wu noted he requested amendments to the rule to ensure the rule can be enforced.
Chief Wu noted that enforcement by his department is generally complaint driven and the
police typically attempt to contact the owner before posting notice to begin the process of
enforcement. Committee members asked additional questions of Chief Wu around the
enforcement of the rule, the number of parking complaints received, and whether any
tickets had been issued. Discussion ensued. Chair Kyrouz then opened the issue for Public
Comment and the following residents spoke:
Richard Snyder 
Jamie Feliz 
Nate Lane 
Wendy Miller 
Jerry Butler 
Matina Seremetis 
Larry Stoehr
