Technical Items for Discussion and Action:  B through G 
 
A. Consent Calendar:  
 
H.  Annual Adjustment of the Regional Transportation Impact Fee: 
Najee Zarif asked if there is an opportunity to defer the fee increase due to the 
current economy.  
 
4
Andrew Chesley stated the Regional Transportation Impact fee is part of an 
agreement with all the cities and the county. To make a change on the agreement 
it requires all parties to agree to the change and sign off. SJCOG staff will 
continue to follow the agreement.  
 
It was moved/seconded (Johnson/Chang) to approve the consent calendar. Motion 
passed unanimously by voice vote. 
 
B. Update on Sales Tax – Verbal Report: 
Steve Dial gave an update. He stated due to the current situation it is hard to forecast 
because SJCOG does not know yet where the bottom of the downturn is, or how long 
it will last. The modeling assumes a 50% reduction for May and June to close out this 
fiscal year with a nearly 7% decrease in fiscal year revenues or $4.3 million in FY 19-
20. He continues to state that he carries 50% forward to July, August, and September, 
then decrease the shortfall to 25% for the next three months and then flat for the 
remainder of the FY.  
 
George Lorente asked if the June payment is the last for fiscal year 2020. Steve Dial 
stated that for accounting purposes SJCOG would wait until August to get the final 
June sales.  
 
This item was for discussion only. 
 
C. Draft 2019 Measure K Strategic Plan: 
David Ripperda stated, in January 2020, the SJCOG Board approved keeping the 
Measure K Renewal revenue estimate at $2.6 billion. While the COVID-19 crisis has 
had a drastic impact on sales tax revenues, it is currently difficult to quantify the 
magnitude of the economic impacts. Therefore, SJCOG staff proceeded with the 
Draft 2019 Strategic Plan using the $2.6 billion estimate. This estimate will be 
reevaluated during Fiscal Year 2020/21 as part of the 2021 Strategic Plan update. 
 
Najee Zarif asked if there is any thought on how SJCOG will deal with the shortfall. 
David Ripperda stated that it would take collaboration from each agency. He 
continues to state that depending on what cash flow is available, SJCOG staff will be 
looking at shovel ready projects.  
 
This item was for discussion only. 
 
D. 2020 Measure K Ordinance and Expenditure Plan Amendment:  
David Ripperda stated SJCOG Board would consider this request to amend the 
Measure K Expenditure Plan at a public hearing on May 28, 2020. If the Board 
approves the amendment request, SJCOG staff will notify all cities in San Joaquin 
and the County of San Joaquin of the Board’s action. 
 
It was moved/seconded (Zaca/Zarif) to recommend to the SJCOG Board that they 
amend the Measure K Renewal Ordinance to revise the Regional Congestion 
Management Plan language as shown in Attachment B. Motion passed unanimously 
by voice vote.  
5
 
E. Draft Fiscal Year 20/21 Unmet Transit Needs Report: 
Ashely Goldlist reported that this year’s assessment included nine public hearings, an 
online survey posted on SJCOG’s website, and paper submissions, producing a total 
of 107 comments on transit service from specific individuals. After review of all 
comments with the Social Services Transportation Advisory Committee, SJCOG 
found no unmet transit needs to be recommended to be found reasonable to meet. 
 
This item was for discussion only. 
 
F. 2022 RTP/SCS Briefing: Refining a Regional Approach to Housing: 
Christine Corrales presented this item. Ms. Corrales discussed the AB101 housing 
and homelessness budget trailer bill. AB 101 requires that the San Joaquin Valley 
Regional Transportation Planning Agency have a working group to direct how REAP 
funds are used.  
 
Andrew Chesley commented on the Valley Link meeting and the state’s shortfall on 
housing.  
 
This item was for discussion only. 
 
G. Federal Fiscal Year 2019/20 Delivery of Federal Funding: 
Ryan Niblock announced that funding available for projects cannot be guaranteed 
later in the spring and summer as funding made available to the rest of the state. All 
Requests for Authorization (RFA) must be submitted to Caltrans District 10 no later 
than July 1, 2020, or they will not be processed until the next federal fiscal year in 
November 2020. 
 
This item was for discussion only. 
 
5.      Other Matters of Business:     
Diane Nguyen stated the TAC meeting in June would be via Zoom. She continues to state that 
the election of a new chair and vice-chair will be on the June agenda.  
 
 6.       Adjournment: 
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 10:56 a.m. to

SUBJECT: 
COVID-19 Sales Tax Impact Update 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
Information 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
Last month staff presented the attached PowerPoint presentation to the San Joaquin Council of 
Governments Board of Directors. This presentation displays the most current information 
available to us regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on the two sales tax programs for which 
SJCOG is responsible: Local Transportation Fund (LTF) and Measure K.  
 
COVID-19 Sales Tax Impact Update 5-28-2020 
 
The presentation provides the assumptions used to make a revenue forecast for both the LTF and 
Measure K. In terms of relevant data, it is very early to be able to make a more definitive 
forecast. The next piece of information will come June 19th when the California Department of 
Tax and Fee administration releases data on sales from the month of April. And, ultimately, it 
likely will not be until we receive information on May and June sales in July and August before a 
more definitive forecast can be provided. 
 
If you have any questions regarding the presentation, please don't hesitate to contact me.

STAFF REPORT  
 
SUBJECT: 
Draft 2020 Federal Legislative Platform 
         
RECOMMENDED ACTION: Adopt the Federal Legislative Platform and 
include these positions as part of the San Joaquin 
One Voice® Program 
 
DISCUSSION: 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SJCOG annually develops a set of principles and policy positions to support SJCOG’s work in 
linking transportation, housing, and air quality. This comes forwards as the Federal Legislative 
Platform. The platform represents a foundation for key issues that are anticipated to be considered 
during the course of the legislative session. Once formally adopted, the legislative platform will 
guide staff’s analysis and recommendations on pending legislative and regulatory items in the 
upcoming session and will be used in the SJCOG One Voice® effort.  
 
Having these issues and priorities identified will further help SJCOG navigate the ever-changing 
political landscape in Washington and ensure the region continues to take advantage of 
opportunities for funding and engagement with our policymakers at the Federal level. It is 
10
particularly timely to have a Federal Legislative Platform due to the expiration of the FAST Act on 
September 30, 2020. 
 
BACKGROUND:  
 
Since 2000, SJCOG has retained a federal legislative advocacy firm to assist the agency in policy 
development and appropriations requests, including funding requests for several regional 
transportation projects as part of federal transportation reauthorization bills. The current 
legislative consultant, CJ Lake, has also kept SJCOG staff abreast of transportation, housing, 
energy, and air quality related developments in Washington and has assisted in communicating 
SJCOG’s positions on different planning-related issues or specific legislation.  
 
SJCOG has worked with CJ Lake to develop the draft legislative platform in Attachment A. This 
platform adds to last year’s platform. The draft platform highlights the position of SJCOG on 
important issues and provides general direction to staff and SJCOG’s legislative advocates as they 
prepare for a “virtual” San Joaquin One Voice® trip in September and when working with our 
partner agencies or SJCOG’s state association, CALCOG.  
 
RECOMMENDATION:  
 
Staff recommends approving these positions so they can be utilized to represent the region’s 
interests in Washington DC. This platform will be used in the San Joaquin One Voice® program 
which is anticipated in September 2020 as a smaller scale virtual “trip”.

DRAFT 2020 SJCOG FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE 
PLATFORM 
(CONTINUANCE OF 2019 POLICY POSITIONS AND POTENTIAL 
POSITIONS FOR 2020) 
DATED: June 4, 2020 
 
2019 Federal Legislative Platform – continue the 
following positions: 
Aviation 
 Support flexibility with respect to the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), a 
federal grant program that provides funding to airports to help improve safety and 
efficiency. 
 
 Support language that would address the 2014 FAA rule regarding voter 
approved general sales taxes. San Joaquin County, like many other self-help 
counties, has an airport and the County receives funds raised on the sales tax 
associated with the sale of aviation fuel. The 2014 FAA rule changed the 
definition of "local taxes on aviation fuel" to apply to all sales taxes rather than 
specific excise taxes on aviation fuel. This change diverts funding away from 
projects outlined in local sales tax measures. 
 
 
Automated and Connected Vehicles 
 The integration of AVs and Connected Vehicles into the nation's transportation 
system should not come at the expense of local autonomy. Regional 
organizations (such as Councils of Governments) should have the opportunity to 
guide the testing and adoption of AVs that makes the most sense for their 
community and region. 
 
12
 Support additional focus on how regional organizations can facilitate the regional 
sharing, storage, and use of data. 
 
 
Economic Incentives for Job Growth 
 Promote the inclusion of transportation and other types of infrastructure funding 
in any federal proposal for an economic stimulus package 
 
 Support economic development incentives for hard hit areas to take the place of 
the former Enterprise Zone. 
 
 
 Opportunity Zones -- the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 authorized the 
designation of Opportunity Zones to spur investment in distressed communities 
throughout the U.S. by offering tax incentives for investments in those areas. 
Each governor nominated local areas within their state for these designations, 
and the U.S. Treasury reviewed these areas and designated a total of 8,761 
zones. San Joaquin County has 20 within the County. We will want to support 
final regulations that allow local governments to determine the types of 
development eligible for Opportunity Zone investments. 
 
 Support the introduction of empowerment zone legislation. 
 
Transportation Funding 
 Support stabilizing and increasing transportation infrastructure funding sources to 
avoid the bankruptcy of the federal highway and transit trust funds. Could 
include: 
o Support to increase and index the gas tax to inflation. 
o Explore innovative funding mechanisms, such as a pay-by-the-mile user fee 
and public private partnerships. 
o Expand access to Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act 
(TIFIA) loans. 
o Remove procedural obstacles that impede expenditure of authorized federal 
funding. 
o Support the return of directed federal funding for transportation priorities. 
 
13
 Support the continuation of, and increased investment in, federal discretionary 
grant opportunities such as the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) 
and Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) programs. 
Expand the INFRA program to include both competitive and formula-based 
awards. 
 
Mobility 
 Engage on issues related to transit technology/clean corridor tracking/new 
technology/platooning  
 Explore opportunities for Federal grants to fund various transportation priorities, 
including transit and bikeways 
 
Regional Transportation Plan 
 Support efforts to change the adoption cycle for the Regional Transportation Plan 
from the current four-year requirement to a flexible timeframe (6-10 years). 
 
Project Streamlining 
 Support legislation and/or administrative reforms to streamline the federal and 
state government’s project delivery process and to eliminate unnecessary and/or 
duplicative requirements (CEQA/NEPA) 
 
 
14
 
Potential Policy Additions to the Federal Legislative 
Platform  
 
Infrastructure Package/Surface Transportation 
Reauthorization 
General 
 Support no limitation on years of operations funding for Vanpools, Public-Private 
Partnerships on Employee Shuttles, and MicroTransit (first and last mile). 
 
 Support funding programs for Low or No Emissions bus transit vehicle 
replacement and expansion and related infrastructure. 
 
 Support funding levels responsive to the adverse impacts to Local Streets and 
Road budgets due to COVID-19 impacts. Public agencies are experienced 
significant reductions in Local Transportation Funds, Local Transportation Sales 
Tax Measures, and Local Development Impact Fees. Increased funding levels 
will be needed to continue the delivery of transportation projects.  
 
 
Modifications to Federal Matching Funds/Share 
Requirements 
 Local Match Modifications - Request a waiver of local share/match for all 
ongoing transportation projects. Full federal participation eliminates the risk of 
uncertain locally-generated revenues subject to major reductions due to COVID-
19, and will provide confidence to contractors that they will be paid, and to the 
public that the project will be built. It will minimize the risk of projects being 
shelved, providing the stimulus vitally needed for economic recovery. 
 
 Increased FHWA Share - Request Congress increase FHWA share to 90% due 
to COVID-19, authorizing the COVID-19/national pandemic emergency as an 
eligible reason for assistance, mirroring the 23 USC §125 Emergency Relief 
program for disaster response. 
15
 
 Local Share Delays - Request a delay in requirements to provide local share for 
a certain time period, similar to the payroll tax provision in the CARES Act. 
 
 Project Reclassification - Reclassify projects sources of federal funds (classify 
projects as Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) or another program) to 
circumvent local share/match requirements. 
 
 
Modify Surface Transportation Block Grant Utilization 
 
 Utilize the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (STBGP) (23 U.S.C. 
§133) under the federal-aid highway program and public transportation program 
for stimulus spending. Distribute this funding using existing formulas and sub-
allocation procedures under 23 U.S.C. §133.  
 
 Remove local match requirements so federal funds can cover 100% of a project’s 
costs. Allow funds provided in a stimulus bill to be used as the local share funds 
for any program, including the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, 
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality, and Metropolitan Planning. Allowing new 
funds to be used to match other program funds would help ensure speedier 
project delivery.  
 
Congestion Management and Air Quality Program 
 
 Support new program and (and additional funds) to explicitly include replacement 
of essential nontransit vehicles (example, police cars, garbage trucks and sewer 
trucks) which can demonstrate air pollution reductions with conversion. 
 
 
Trade Corridor/ Goods Movement 
 
 Support strategic investments to improve goods movement for agricultural supply 
chain and manufacturing logistics throughout San Joaquin County. 
 
 Support new funding and planning opportunities to support electric vehicle 
infrastructure and programs for both private vehicles and public transit fleets. 
 
16
 Support additional funding opportunities for managed lanes, particularly in 
corridors which serve as gateways between regions. 
 
 Support funding specific to rehabilitation or operational improvements to STAA 
routes. 
 
 Support funding focused specific to bridge rehabilitation and replacement in trade 
corridors. 
 
Work From Home/ Telework 
 
 Support planning research & funding to MPOs for planning studies on regional 
teleworking policies, ordinances and measures to improve air quality. 
 
 Support funding to capital programs for the development of telework and 
broadband network implementation strategies to reduce VMT.

STAFF REPORT 
 
SUBJECT: 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security (CARES) Act Transit Funding 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION:  
Discussion 
 
 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed on March 27, 2020, 
provides $2 trillion in federal funding through a number of programs to address issues as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public transit will receive $25 billion through the CARES Act. 
Specifically, within San Joaquin County, the following has been made available to urbanized areas 
(UZA): 
• Stockton UZA – $33,734,638 
• Lodi UZA – $5,532,640 
• Manteca UZA – $6,830,739 
• Tracy UZA – $7,101,511 
• California has been apportioned $94,976,667 for rural transit providers. Caltrans is 
responsible for distributing these funds to regions. 
 
Funding will be provided at a 100-percent federal share, with no local match required – to support 
capital, operating, and other expenses generally eligible under those programs to prevent, prepare 
for, and respond to COVID-19.  FTA will permit Urbanized Area Formula Program or Formula 
Grants for Rural Areas Program funding to be used for COVID-19-related public transportation 
capital or operating expenses at an 80 percent federal share, regardless of whether operating 
expenses generally are an eligible expense for a recipient.  Eligible activities include emergency 
protective measures to eliminate or lessen threats to public health and safety, such as performing 
enhanced cleaning/sanitizing of rolling stock, stations, bus shelters, etc.; placing hand sanitizer 
dispensers in high traffic areas; and providing personal protective equipment as appropriate. 
Operating expenses incurred beginning on January 20, 2020 for all rural and urban recipients, even 
those in large urban areas, are also eligible, including operating expenses to maintain transit 
services as well as paying for administrative leave for transit personnel due to reduced operations 
during an emergency.  Funds are available until expended.  There is no lapse date to obligate funds 
available under the CARES Act. 
 
Split and/or sub allocation letters must be updated to include funds made available under the 
CARES Act.  SJCOG staff held meetings with transit operators to discuss needs and priority 
criteria, and to seek agreement on strategy to split funds.  SJCOG staff has worked with RTD, 
ACE, Lodi, Manteca, Tracy, and Ripon to identify appropriate split of Stockton UZA, Lodi UZA, 
Manteca UZA, and Tracy UZA funds. Specifically, the split of funding is as follows: 
19
• RTD – $16,257,304 from the Stockton UZA 
• ACE – $17,477,334 from the Stockton UZA 
• Lodi – $5,532,640 from the Lodi UZA 
• Manteca – $6,830,739 from the Manteca UZA 
• Tracy – $7,101,511 from the Tracy UZA

STAFF REPORT 
 
SUBJECT: 
 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION:  
Final FY 20/21 Unmet Transit Needs 
Report 
 
 
Approve Final FY 20/21 Unmet Transit 
Needs Report 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
Each year, pursuant to state law, the Transportation Development Act (TDA), as the Regional 
Transportation Planning Agency, the San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) must identify 
any unmet transit needs that may exist in San Joaquin County.  If needs are found, SJCOG must 
determine whether those needs are reasonable to meet.  SJCOG must ensure that reasonable needs 
are met before TDA funds are allocated to local jurisdictions for non-transit purposes.   
 
The unmet transit needs assessment requires SJCOG to meet the following requirements: 
• Ensure that several factors have been considered in the planning process, including: 
1. Size and location of groups likely to be dependent on transit,  
2. Adequacy of existing services and potential alternative services  
3. Service improvements that could meet all or part of the travel demand.  
• Hold a public hearing to receive testimony on unmet needs. 
• Determine definitions for "unmet transit needs" and "reasonable to meet." 
• Adopt a finding regarding unmet transit needs and allocate funds to address those needs, if 
necessary, before street and road TDA allocations. 
 
This year’s assessment included nine public hearings, an online survey posted on SJCOG’s 
website, and paper submissions, producing a total of 107 comments on transit service from specific 
individuals. After review of all comments with the Social Services Transportation Advisory 
Committee, SJCOG found no unmet transit needs recommended be found reasonable to meet. 
The report is available on SJCOG’s website: https://www.sjcog.org/UTN. 
 
Comments on the report will be accepted through June 22, 2020.  The SJCOG Board is expected 
to take action on the final report at its regularly scheduled June meeting. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: 
 
Vote to approve the Final FY 20/21 Unmet Transit Needs Report. 
 
22
BACKGROUND: 
 
At the request of the SSTAC, SJCOG formed a subcommittee to review the adopted definitions of 
“unmet transit need” and “reasonable to meet”. The updated definitions as proposed by the 
subcommittee and adopted by the Board in February 2018, are as follows: 
 
 
 
23
An unmet transit need that meets the definition above and meets all the following criteria shall be 
considered reasonable to meet: 
 
24
 
Within the definition, an unmet transit need cannot be found unreasonable solely based upon 
economic feasibility. 
25
Operational, Educational, and Non-Specific Comments on Transit Service  
The annual Unmet Transit Needs process provides a broad opportunity for the public to provide 
input on transit services in San Joaquin County. As a result, comments are often submitted that do 
not meet the definition of unmet transit needs provided above. These comments generally fall in 
the following categories: 
 
Although these comments cannot be considered unmet transit needs and thus are not evaluated as 
to whether they are “reasonable to meet,” they still provide valuable input on transit service. 
SJCOG forwards all comments to the relevant transit operators, who consider them when 
developing service improvements or providing educational materials to the public. 
 
 
26
DISCUSSION: 
 
Public Input 
This year’s Unmet Transit Needs process included an extended public outreach process using new 
techniques to gain public input. These efforts were intended to promote multiple opportunities for 
members of the public to communicate their unmet transit needs (e.g., SJCOG website, survey, 
social media, phone,). Examples of this effort include: 
• Nine public hearings held throughout San Joaquin County, including at least one hearing

• Attending community events and reaching out to local organizations 
• An online survey was posted on the SJCOG website and e-blasted to interested parties 
The various community outreach efforts produced a total of 107 comments on transit service. 
 
Analysis of Comments Received 
SJCOG convened a UTN Review Subcommittee consisting of seven members of the SSTAC 
(including RTD, other transit operators, and social service providers).  Most comments were 
deemed to fall into the Operational, Educational, or Non-Specific categories defined above, and as 
such were not considered unmet transit needs. These comments will be forwarded to the 
appropriate transit operators for consideration in service planning.

STAFF REPORT 
 
SUBJECT: 
Final 2019 Measure K Strategic Plan 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
Recommend to the SJCOG Board that they 
adopt the 2019 Measure K Strategic Plan 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
The Measure K Strategic Plan serves as the guiding document for the delivery of 
Measure K (Renewal) projects and programs. In January 2020, the SJCOG Board 
approved keeping the Measure K Renewal revenue estimate at the level previously 
adopted in the 2017 Strategic Plan update, $2.6 billion. 
 
While the COVID-19 crisis has had a drastic impact on sales tax revenues it is 
currently difficult to quantify the magnitude of the economic impacts. Therefore, 
SJCOG staff proceeded with the Draft 2019 Strategic Plan using the $2.6 billion estimate. This 
estimate will be reevaluated during Fiscal Year 2020/21 as part of the 2021 Strategic Plan update. 
 
The Draft 2019 Strategic Plan document was provided for public review online on May 6. No 
comments on the draft plan were received from any members of the public, local agencies, or 
transit operators. The final document is available at:  https://www.sjcog.org/302/Plans-
Publications. 
 
RECOMMENDATION:  
 
SJCOG staff recommend that the TAC recommend to the SJCOG Board that they adopt the 2019 
Measure K Strategic Plan.  
 
FISCAL IMPACT:  
 
None at this time.  There will be direct fiscal impacts from the adoption of the Measure K Strategic 
Plan which will set Measure K allocations for eligible projects through Fiscal Year 2030/31. 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
Measure K is the half-cent sales tax dedicated to transportation projects in San Joaquin County. 
With its original passage in November 1990, Measure K began laying the groundwork for funding 
for a system of improved highways and local streets, new passenger rail service, regional and inter-
regional bus routes, new bicycle facilities, and railroad crossings.  
30
 
Measure K Renewal:  On November 7, 2006, San Joaquin 
County voters decided to extend Measure K for an additional 
30 years.  
 
The categorical allocations of Measure K Renewal (hereafter 
referred simply as Measure K) include Local Street Repairs and 
roadway Safety (35%), Congestion Relief projects (32.5%), 
Railroad Crossing Safety Projects (2.5%), and Passenger Rail, 
Bus, and Bicycles (30%), which includes subcategories for Rail 
Transit, Bus Transit, Bus Rapid Transit, and Bicycle, 
Pedestrian, and Safe Routes to Schools improvements.   
 
The renewal of Measure K was initially estimated to generate $3 billion, but current estimates as 
of January 2020 are at $2.6 billion, representing a $370 million decrease.   
 
The Measure K Strategic Plan serves as the guiding document for the delivery of Measure K 
(Renewal) projects and programs. The Strategic Plan functions as a Measure K capital 
improvement program (CIP) for all eligible categories approved by San Joaquin voters.  Its 
financial plan describes the long-term revenue forecast, capital funding requirements, borrowing 
needs and the associated debt service costs of the program.  The current version of the Plan, the 
2017 Measure K Strategic Plan, provides a twenty-year outlook of Measure K projects through 
Fiscal Year 2030/31.  Pursuant to the Measure K Renewal Expenditure Plan, a Strategic Plan is to 
be updated every two years: 
 
SJCOG will prepare a Strategic Plan every two years. The Strategic Plan will be the master 
document for delivery of the Expenditure Plan projects and can be amended at any time. The 
purposes of the Strategic Plan are as follows:  
 
• 
Defines the scope, cost, and schedule of each project 
• 
Identifies accomplishments and critical issues 
• 
Lists a set of amendments to these projects 
• 
Details the revenue projections and possible financing tools needed to deliver the 
Expenditure Plan 
• 
Gathers into one document the policies and procedures of the Expenditure Plan 
• 
Serves as an annual budget 
 
The San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) is the administrator of the Measure K half-
cent sales tax program. Due to the decrease in revenue from the Great Recession and the COVID-
19 crisis, not all Measure K projects identified in the Expenditure Plan can be funded in the 30-
year life of the sales tax program. The region will need to delve into difficult policy decisions and 
make hard choices on what Measure K projects can be funded. This means Measure K 
expenditures, project priorities, and policies will be re-examined and possibly new policies 
developed to create a financially constrained plan that balances project delivery within funding 
limitations. 
31
 
2019 Measure K Strategic Plan 
 
Throughout spring 2020, SJCOG staff met with all local agencies and transit operators to discuss 
the implications of the Measure K financial picture and how to prioritize projects. staff worked 
with project sponsors to finalize the scope, cost, and schedule of all Measure K projects. In January 
2020, the SJCOG Board approved keeping the Measure K Renewal revenue estimate at the level 
previously adopted in the 2017 Strategic Plan update, $2.6 billion. 
 
While the COVID-19 crisis has had a drastic impact on sales tax revenues it is currently difficult 
to quantify the magnitude of the economic impacts. Therefore, SJCOG staff proceeded with the 
Draft 2019 Strategic Plan using the $2.6 billion estimate. This estimate will be reevaluated during 
Fiscal Year 2020/21 as part of the 2021 Strategic Plan update. 
 
In April 2020, SJCOG’s financial consultant PFM completed a cash flow analysis of the Measure 
K Capital Program based upon existing and future anticipated debt service and revenue as shown 
in Figure 1. The cash flow analysis indicated that only approximately $74.5 million would be 
available to program to new Congestion Relief projects between Fiscal Year 2020/21 and Fiscal 
Year 2030/31. SJCOG developed a Strategic Plan programming scenario based upon this cash 
flow analysis and several underlying policies and assumptions.

STAFF REPORT 
 
SUBJECT: 
 
 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION:  
2020 Regional Congestion 
Management Program (RCMP) 
Monitoring and Conformance Report  
 
Adopt the 2020 RCMP Monitoring 
Report & find all the jurisdictions 
conform to the requirements of RCMP  
 
DISCUSSION: 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
SJCOG is required by state and federal law to monitor all elements of the Regional Congestion 
Management Program (RCMP) and to ensure that the county and cities are conforming to the 
RCMP. Conformance findings are a requisite step for local agency eligibility for Section 2105 
state gas tax subvention funds made available by Proposition 111, Federal Regional Surface 
Transportation Program (RSTP) funds, Federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) 
funds, state Regional Improvement Improvement Plan (RTIP) funds, and local Measure K funds.  
 
The RCMP Monitoring and Conformance Report includes: 1) a determination of consistency 
with RCMP traffic level of service (LOS) standards, and 2) implementation of the RCMP land-
use analysis program for mitigation of impacts of local land-use decisions on the RCMP 
network. SJCOG conducted the LOS technical analysis for committee review and found that all 
jurisdictions are meeting LOS standards. SJCOG staff has also requested information on the 
implementation of identified mitigation measures as part of the Land Use Analysis Program.  
 
SJCOG staff has found San Joaquin County and the cities of Escalon, Lathrop, Lodi, Ripon, 
Stockton, and Tracy in conformance with the requirements of the RCMP. 
 
The draft 2020 RCMP Monitoring and Conformance Report is available at: 
www.sjcog.org/RCMP.  
 
As SJCOG staff is in the process of opting out of State Congestion Management Program 
(SCMP), SJCOG is bond by state and federal law. To date, the Cities of Escalon, Manteca, and 
Ripon have passed resolutions that opted their jurisdictions out of SCMP.

RECOMMENDATION: 
 
SJCOG staff recommends the SJCOG Board of Directors adopt the 2020 RCMP Monitoring 
Report and find all jurisdictions conform with all the requirements of RCMP.  
 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
 
Not impact to SJCOG OWP. This report is included 
as part of our OWP element 801.04 (Congestion 
Management Program/System). 
 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
Federal Legislative Requirements 
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 
requires metropolitan areas exceeding a population 
of 200,000 to implement a Congestion Management 
Process, defined as “a systematic and regionally-
accepted approach for managing congestion that 
provides accurate, up-to-date information on 
transportation system performance and assesses 
alternative strategies for congestion management 
that meet state and local needs.”1 This requirement 
was first introduced by the Intermodal Surface 
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 and was refined in subsequent transportation 
bills, including the most recent Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act of 2015.  
State Legislative Requirements 
In 1990, California voters approved legislation to increase transportation funding through an 
additional fuel tax (Proposition 111). With the passage of Proposition 111, urbanized counties 
were required to prepare, adopt, implement, and biennially update a Congestion Management 
Program. The state’s primary focus is to monitor the impacts of growth on the regional 
transportation network and establish strategies to avoid and/or respond to segments of the 
network that are failing. Proposition 111 provides Section 2105 state gas tax subvention funds 
for cities and counties to implement their CMP as shown in Table 1. 
San Joaquin County Measure K 
The region’s local Measure K Renewal Ordinance, approved by voters in 2006, required 
SJCOG to establish and begin implementing the Regional CMP (RCMP) by January 1, 2008.

RCMP Monitoring and Conformance Report 
SJCOG is required by state and federal law to monitor all elements of the RCMP and to ensure 
that the county and cities are conforming to the RCMP. Compliance findings are a requisite step 
for local agency eligibility for Section 2105 state gas tax subvention funds made available by 
Proposition 111, Federal Regional Surface Transportation Program (RSTP) funds, Federal 
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds, state Regional Improvement 
Improvement Plan (RTIP) funds, and local Measure K funds. The compliance monitoring 
includes a biennial monitoring and conformance report and a program update, including a 
technical analysis of current Level of Service (LOS) on the RCMP Network and documentation 
of compliance with the requirements of the RCMP Land Use Analysis Program. 
 
Discussion: 
 
RCMP Technical Analysis Results 
 
SJCOG’s adopted RCMP standard is LOS D. LOS E/F are deemed deficient and may require 
intersection and/or roadway improvments to increase the LOS rating to LOS D. The tables, 
below, illustrate the results of LOS analysis before exemption process. LOS analysis found a 
total of 18 basic freeway segments and 17 two-lane highway segments deficient during AM peak 
period. A total of 30 basic freeway segments and 15 two-lane highway segments were found 
deficient during PM peak period. In addition, a total of 17 intersections during AM peak period 
and 16 intersections of PM peak period along with 10 urbans street segments were found 
deficient. It should be noted that one segment and one intersection lies at the edge of two 
jurisdictions. 
 
The LOS analysis found that after applying exemptions allowed under state law, including 
deducting interregional trips, accounting for construction impacts and planned improvements, 
accounting for programmed transportation projects that would relieve congestion, and exempting 
facilities that operated below the established LOS standard when the CMP was established

standard except for: 
 
•

• 
Byron Road between Lammers Road and County Line 
 
It is at SJCOG’s discretion to determine the non-conformance of a jurisdiction and require a 
deficiency report if a roadway or intersection was found deficient. SJCOG found jurisdictions to 
be in conformance with the RCMP and no deficiency plan is requested at this time. It can be 
noted that neither of these segments were found to be deficient based on the monitoring cycle of 
2016. 
 
Merge/Diverge Analysis 
 
A merge /diverge analysis was introduced to this report as an informational item. City of 
Manteca expressed a concern that the 2016 RCMP Monitoring Report did not show SR-120 
segment between Airport Way and SR-99 deficient before exemptions for interregional trips 
during the November 2016 TAC Meeting. As a result, this additional layer of analysis was 
added. 
 
The scope of the merge/diverge analysis included SR-120 between I-5 & SR-99 and specific 
corridors along SR-99 and I-5 chosen based on their LOS rating. However, six segments lacked 
the current Caltrans turning movement data to perform a merge/diverge analysis. Two segments 
were along SR-120; including 1) SR-120 between I-5 and Guthmiller Road and 2) SR-120 
between Main Street and SR-99.  
 
There are five merge/diverge locations during AM peak commute period and eight during PM 
peak commute period with a rating of LOS E of F. In these occurrences, average speed was 
deemed “unstable” due the high density of passenger cars per mile per lane. There are four 
occurrences on I-5, 7 on SR-99, and two on SR-120.

RCMP Land Use Analysis Program 
 
The RCMP is required to contain a program to analyze the impacts of land use decisions made 
by local jurisdictions on the regional transportation system. To comply with this state mandate, 
SJCOG and its members have integrated a “regional layer” of review within the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review process to analyze impacts of development projects 
to the CMP transportation system. The RCMP Monitoring and Conformance Report must 
document each local agency’s performance over the previous two years to comply with the 
RCMP, including but not limited to the following: 
 
• 
Implementation progress of mitigation measures identified as part of the RCMP Land 
Use Analysis Program.  
• 
Compliance with the CEQA mitigation monitoring requirements for RCMP impacts. 
 
SJCOG staff analyzed development projects that local agencies approved between 2010 and 
2019 for which SJCOG staff had provided comments relating to the RCMP. A map and summary 
of the project’s status and its mitigation meaures is in Appendix B of the 2019 Monitoring and 
Conformance Report. 
 
   
NEXT STEPS: 
 
SJCOG staff will process with opting out of State Congestion Management Program.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
As the designated Congestion Management Agency (CMA) for San Joaquin County, the San Joaquin 
Council of Governments (SJCOG) is responsible for updating County’s Regional Congestion Management 
Program (RCMP) and monitoring its implementation. Pursuant to Section 65089.3 of the California 
Government Code, SJCOG must determine if each City and the County is conforming to the following 
RCMP requirements: 
x
Consistency with the RCMP LOS standards;  
x
Implementation of the RCMP Land Use Analysis Program to mitigate impacts to RCMP designated 
roadways and intersections from local land use decisions;  
x
Progress towards implementing the RCMP Regional Deficiency Plan action list as identified in 
SJCOG’s Regional TDM Plan (August, 2010). 
In addition to the above state requirements governing congestion management compliance, this RCMP 
Monitoring and Conformance Assessment Report also serves to track and report the following: 
x
Monitoring of SJCOG’s RCMP performance measures;  
x
Compliance with the SJCOG’s Measure K renewal requirements to implement a state compliant 
Congestion Management Program; 
x
Compliance with the federal FAST Act required congestion management process1. 
This report provides a snapshot of the “state of congestion” on the County’s designated RCMP roadway 
network including segments, intersections, multi-modal corridors, bicycle network and transit network. 
To inform this assessment, SJCOG performed a comprehensive data collection effort in 2018. Where 
congestion problems are identified, this monitoring process establishes the need for development of 
RCMP deficiency plans to remedy such locations. However, State statutes require that the CMA first 
examine if vehicle trips outside the control of local land use decisions are the cause of the deficiency2. 
The primary RCMP trip exemption types applicable to San Joaquin County include: interregional trips 
(trips that do not originate in San Joaquin County); and, trip diversion associated with construction 
related activity. Two additional factors that obviate the need for development of deficiency plans include: 
improvements associated with the deficient facility are already programmed in SJCOG’s Federal 
Transportation Improvement Program; and/or, the deficient facility was identified as RCMP exempt per 
1 The federal Congestion Management Process requires an increased multimodal travel demand management (TDM) and 
system management emphasis at both the local and regional level to comply. Noncompliance with any of these directives 
can have local and regional funding implications. 
2 State statutes requires local agencies to prepare RCMP Deficiency Plans specific to the deficient facilities that identify 
capital improvements that will either directly remedy the capacity deficiency or provide multi-modal system-wide 
benefits to circulation and air quality. Unlike the direct fix approach, a system-wide deficiency plan CIP list must receive 
concurrence from the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District before it can be approved by the local 
agency and SJCOG (Section 65089.4(c)(3).

If SJCOG determines that a local jurisdiction is not conforming to the requirements of the RCMP, the 
agency will have 90 days to correct any issues of non-conformance.  If the local agency fails to resolve 
these issues, SJCOG is required to notify the State Controller, who shall then withhold all apportionments 
of Section 2105 gas tax subvention funds to the nonconforming jurisdiction until the issue of 
nonconformance is resolved.  If the local jurisdiction has not resolved the issue of nonconformance after 
12 months, the State Controller must allocate the withheld gas tax apportionment to SJCOG who is then 
required to spend the apportionment on regionally significant projects identified in the RCMP's Capital 
Improvement Program or improvements identified in adopted deficiency plans (i.e., SJCOG Regional 
Deficiency Plan, August 2010).  In addition, the Metropolitan Planning Organization (SJCOG) shall not 
program federal Surface Transportation Program (STP) or Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) 
funds for any project in the nonconforming jurisdiction unless it is considered a regionally significant 
project or is identified in an adopted deficiency plan.   
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
The 2020 conformance findings indicate that all jurisdictions in San Joaquin County are currently 
conforming to the RCMP. SJCOG is deferring the need for the San Joaquin County to prepare RCMP 
Deficiency Plans for one deficient RCMP local arterial segment at this time to allow another monitoring 
round to confirm these findings.  As monitoring continues, greater documentation of local agency 
compliance with the RCMP LUAP is anticipated. A summary of the monitoring results is provided below.

Executive Summary 
  
4 
RCMP Intersections were established by SJCOG with input from its member agencies, focusing primarily 
on state highway ramp termini and state/local arterial intersections of regional importance. A total of 
108 intersections are currently designated as RCMP intersections. A total of 93 intersections were 
analyzed in 2020. Based on 2018 AM/PM intersection turn movement counts, the Highway Capacity 
Manual operational method was applied to determine intersection operations. Results indicate that all 
intersections operate at acceptable LOS during both weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, with the 
exception of 13 intersections that were determined to be operating at LOS E or F. These 13 intersections 
were then subject to an Exemption Analysis to determine if the intersection could be exempted from the 
observed LOS deficiency due to interregional trips, optimized signal timing, construction impacts, 
programmed improvements, and/or “grandfathered” segments. These exemptions are described further 
in Section 3.4 of this report. A summary of these RCMP intersection results are provided in Table 2.

Basic Freeway Segments 
Based on the most recent published volumes by Caltrans (2017), portions of I-5, SR-99, SR-120, SR-4 and 
I-205 were determined to be operating at LOS E or F during the a.m. or p.m. peak hours. After accounting 
for locally generated trips (interregional trip exemption), only one segment of SR-99 would operate at 
LOS E or worse. Staff deferred the request for a RCMP Deficiency Plan from SJCOG, “the responsible 
party,” at this time.A summary of these results are provided in Table 3.

Merge / Diverge Analysis 
A merge /diverge analysis was introduced to this report as an informational item. At the November 
2016 TAC Meeting, City of Manteca expressed a concern that the 2016 RCMP Monitoring Report did 
not show SR-120 segment between Airport Way and SR-99 deficient before exemptions for 
interregional trips. This additional layer of analysis was added as a result.  
Merge / diverge analysis assesses the average speed, capacity (passenger cars per mile per lane), and 
LOS in select freeway interchanges during AM and PM peak commute periods. Segments analyzed 
included SR-99 near middle to northern San Joaquin County, I-5 near City of Lathrop and Stockton, and 
all of SR-120. It is important to note that the merge/diverge analysis could not performed at the 
following interchanges due to a lack of current Caltrans and turning movement data. 
x
I-5 & Pershing Avenue 
x
I-5 & Fremont Street 
x
SR-99 & Armstrong Road  
x
SR-99 & Harney Lane 
x
SR-120 & Guthmiller Rd  
x
SR-120 & Main Street 
 
The results found 13 merge/diverge locations rated LOS E or F, 5 during AM peak commute period and 
8 during PM peak commute period. The majority of locations with unfavorable conditions (i.e. LOS E or 
F) in the merge/diverge analysis lied along segments rated LOS D or better in the standard RCMP LOS 
analysis. For example, the eastbound merge at SR-120 and Airport Way was rated LOS F while SR-120 
between Airport Way and Main Street received a LOS D rating during PM peak period. Eastbound 
merge at SR-120 and Union Road also received LOS F rating while the same above segment receiving 
LOS D rating during PM peak period. 
As an informational analysis, LOS ratings of E or F in the merge/diverge analysis are not classified as 
RCMP deficiencies and do not trigger the need for a Deficiency Plan. However, SJCOG and member 
agencies may still program state, federal, and local funds to remedy the congestion in the area.

Multi-Lane Highway Segments 
State Route 132 (SR 132) from Interstate 580 (I-580) to I-5 is the only multi-lane highway segment 
evaluated for RCMP monitoring purposes. Based on a traffic operational analysis, the multi-lane highway 
segments of SR 132 currently operate at LOS A during both a.m. and p.m. peak hours. 
Two-Lane Highway Segments 
Based on 2017 published volumes by Caltrans, portions of SR-4, SR-12, SR-26, SR-88, SR-120 and SR-132 
were determined to be operating at LOS E or F during the a.m. or p.m. peak hours. After accounting for 
locally generated trips (interregional trip exemption), all two-lane highway segments perform at LOS D 
or better. A summary of these results is provided in Table 5.

Arterial Street Segments 
Based on a traffic operational analysis, portions of seven arterial street segments currently operate at 
LOS E or F. These include: Eight Mile Road; SR-4/Farmington Road; Byron Road; SR-12/Kettleman Lane, 
Airport Way, SR-120/Yosemite Avenue; SR-120; and Arch Airport Road. After accounting for locally 
generated trips (interregional trip exemption), five segments operate at LOS D or better and five 
segments operate at LOS F. Of the segments with LOS F rating, four segments were programmed in 
SJCOG’s Regional Transportation Plan / Sustainable Communities Strategy. One deficient segment was 
not programmed; however, staff will not request a RCMP Deficiency Plan from San Joaquin County, “the 
responsible party,” at this time. This segment was not found deficient in 2016 Monitoring Report. A 
summary of these results is provided in Table 6.

RCMP Regional Deficiency Plan 
As applicable, local agency conformance with the following RCMP Deficiency Plan requirements is also 
tracked:    
x
Complying with the RCMP Monitoring Program traffic count sharing responsibilities;  
x
Local adoption and SJCOG approval of RCMP Deficiency Plans within 12 months of the RCMP 
deficiency finding by SJCOG (as applicable); and, 
x
Progress made in the implementation of previously adopted Deficiency Plan CIP improvement 
projects.  
The only RCMP Deficiency Plan adopted in San Joaquin County was the RCMP Regional Deficiency Plan 
(August, 2010) prepared by SJCOG in coordination with all its member agencies.  This Regional Deficiency 
Plan identified I-5 between French Camp to Charter Way as deficient. The following CIP projects were 
identified in the SJCOG Regional Deficiency Plan: 
Short-term Improvements:  
Park-and-Ride Lot Implementation: 
x
I-5 and Hammer Lane in Stockton: $1,200,000 
x
I-5 and Eighth Mile Road in Stockton: $1,200,000 
x
Stanislaus County locations along the I-5 and SR-99 corridors (2 lots): $2,400,000 
x
Expansion of Lots (I-5 and Ben Holt Drive) & (Kelley Dr. in Stockton): $950,000 (add 80 spaces 
total) 
x
Expansion of Lot (Junction of I-5 and SR-12) – Implemented $400,000 (add 40 spaces total)

Regional Congestion Management Program 
Executive Summary

Long-term Improvement: 
x
Widen I-5 from 6-8 lanes to add an HOV lane in each direction (French Camp to Charter Way): 
$64,000,0003 
Widening I-5 to accommodate an HOV lane in each direction will provide the requisite capacity to remedy 
this deficiency. This project is identified in the 2018 Regional Transportation Plan and is a Measure K 
Renewal Project, but as of today is not programmed in the FTIP.  
The I-5 North Stockton Improvement Project that widens the I-5 between Martin Luther King Jr. 
Boulevard/Charter Way and Hammer Lane from 6 to 8 lanes to add HOV lanes was completed in 2016. 
This relieves some congestion north of the deficient facility but does not fully remedy the issue. 
All jurisdictions have complied with the RCMP LUAP and RCMP Deficiency Plan requirements.  The 
following improvements to program implementation are recommended however: 
x
Both SJCOG and its member agencies need to better inform the transportation and 
environmental consulting community of the RCMP LUAP requirements. 
x
Both SJCOG and its member agencies need to improve traffic count data sharing/transmittal and 
better inform the transportation and environmental consulting community of the RCMP traffic 
count database. 
x
Local agencies need to more proactively consider funding opportunities for RCMP facility 
improvements identified as CEQA mitigation during state/federal discretionary funding cycles as 
well as priorities for local RTIF funding. 
x
SJCOG and its member agencies need to more proactively pursue opportunities to fund 
improvements identified in the RCMP Regional Deficiency Plan (SJCOG, 2010). 
RCMP Multimodal Corridors 
SJCOG, in coordination with its member agencies, has designated twelve roadways as RCMP multimodal 
corridors. These corridors were selected based on their “Complete Street” functionality and are generally 
located in “downtown” areas that are characterized by higher than average numbers of shared roadway 
users (pedestrians, bicyclists, transit passengers, and motorists). For more information, please refer to 
Appendix A.  
 
 
 
3 Note: Cost estimate was current as of publication of 2010 SJCOG Regional Deficiency Plan. Cost estimate for this project 
in the 2018 Regional Transportation Plan was $97,880,000.

Act, or MAP-21. The 2012 adoption of MAP-21, a federal funding source, came with a 
performance- and outcome-based program, known as “Performance-Based Planning and 
Programming (PBPP).” The objective was to invest in projects that will make progress toward 
the achievement of the national goals for transportation. The most recent federal transportation 
bill, Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2016 (FAST Act), carries forward the same 
performance management framework. This performance report includes federal performance 
measures that are thematically split into three groupings under the rubric of “Performance 
Management” (PM).  
 
• PM 1: Roadway Safety 
• PM 2: Transportation Asset Management 
• PM 3: System Reliability, Freight, Congestion, and Air Quality 
 
Introduced to our committees and the board in January 2018, these performance measures will be 
reported annually as required by MAP-21. Caltrans has not released any additional instructions 
or information outside of the state targets; thus, staff has applied our “best practices” 
methodology (based off Caltrans’ methodology) to report on MAP-21 performance measures for 
San Joaquin County. This performance report is the first of many annual reports. As Caltrans’ 
guidelines become more clear, “best practices” methodology may be updated and additional 
information may be included in future performance reports.  
 
The first report was adopted in August 2019. This report found a new informational source for 
bridge conditions along the National Highway System.

BACKGROUND: 
 
In 2012, MAP-21 was adopted and established “PBPP,” with the objective to invest in projects 
that will make progress toward the achievement of the national goals of transportation. Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA) established the final Federal Rule(s) on expected performance 
measures reported by the State Department of Transportation (i.e. Caltrans) and MPOs. This 
performance measure was split into three groups, under the rubric of “Performance 
Management” (PM). 
 
• PM 1 – Safety 
• PM 2 – Transportation Asset Management 
• PM 3 – System Reliability, Freight, Congestion, and Air Quality 
 
New federal and state requirements provide emphasis meeting MAP-21’s objective by requiring 
the identification of short-term targets and standardization of specific performance measures so 
that MPOs within each state, as well as state DOTs across the country, can be directly compared. 
Caltrans held workshops and meetings with MPOs in preparation of statewide targets and 
standardizing the methodology of performance measures. MPOs were asked to support the 
statewide targets or produce their own region-specific target. SJCOG staff supported the 
statewide targets.  
 
PM 1 – Safety 
  
PM 1 addresses traffic safety along with the 
roadway system, including the number of 
fatalities, number of serious injuries, rate of 
fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles 
traveled (100M VMT), rate of serious 
injuries per 100M VMT, and number of 
non-motorized fatalities & serious injuries. 
In cooperation with the Office of Traffic 
Safety, Caltrans generated Strategic 
Highway Safety Plan and Strategic Management Plan that set the guidelines to establish 
statewide targets for PM 1 performance measures. Caltrans releases their statewide target 
annually. 
 
Caltrans referenced the following data sources while determining their targets for PM 1 
performance measures: Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), Fatality 
Analysis Reporting System (FARS), and Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS). 
HPMS supplies the 100M VMT. FARS supplies the fatalities. SWITRS supplies serious injuries 
and a number of non-motorized fatalities & serious injuries.

PM 2 – Transportation Asset Management 
 
PM 2 addresses the condition of the 
existing national highway system 
(NHS), including percent of 
interstate highway system (IHS) of 
NHS in “Good” condition, percent of 
interstate highway system (IHS) of 
NHS in “Poor” condition, percent of 
non-IHS NHS pavement in “Good” 
condition, percent of non-IHS NHS 
pavement in “Poor” condition, 
percent of NHS bridges in “Good” 
condition, and percent of NHS bridges in “Poor” condition. Good condition is defined as, 
“suggests no major investment is needed.” Poor condition is defined as, “suggests major 
reconstruction investment is needed. Caltrans released their 2-year and 4-year statewide PM 1 
targets on May 21, 2018. The review period for 2-year statewide targets are from 1/1/18 to 
12/31/19 and from 1/1/2020 to 12/31/2021 for 4-year statewide targets. 
 
SJCOG staff located a new bridge condition database, in lieu, of missing bridge data from 
Caltrans’ website. Federal Highway Administration’s LTBP Infobridge provides bridge 
conditions along NHS since 1993.  
 
Updated pavement conditions were unobtainable from Caltrans, thus, 2016 pavement conditions 
were referenced. 
 
PM 3 – System Reliability, Freight, Congestion, and Air Quality 
 
PM 3 addresses travel reliability for motorists along NHS and goods movement (referring to the 
movement of freight by truck), as well as emissions reduction due to congestion mitigation and 
air quality improvement (CMAQ) program. PM 3 performance measures include the percent of a 
percent of reliable person-miles traveled on NHS, percentage of interstate system mileage 
provide reliable truck travel time, total emissions reduced by 5 applicable pollutants under 
CMAQ program, annual hours of peak-hour excessive delay per capita, and percent of non-
single occupancy vehicle (SOV) travel. Caltrans released their 2-year and 4-year statewide PM 3 
targets in 2018.  
 
FHWA published their final rule that repeals the performance measure that assesses the 
percentage change in tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions on NHS. In addition, SJCOG is exempt 
from reporting on annual hours of peak-hour excessive delay per capita and percent of non-SOV 
travel due to no urbanized area in San Joaquin County meeting the 1 million population 
threshold. 
 
Caltrans released an interactive website, https://npmrds.iteris-pems.com, for MPOs to access 
monthly statistics on travel reliability for motorists and goods movement. SJCOG referred to 
CMAQ program manager for pollutant reduction-related performance measure.

PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT 
Monitoring our regional roadway system is important for 
the overall goal of addressing reliability, safety, 
pavement and bridges maintenance, goods movement, 
and environmental issues in San Joaquin County. The 
Federal Government signed Moving Ahead for Progress 
in the 21st Century act (MAP 21) into law in 2012, 
requiring the State Department of Transportation (e.g. 
Caltrans) to establish performance measures targets to 
achieve national transportation goals.1  This report 
supplies the most current conditions for each 
performance measure. 
Federal Requirements 
MAP-21 established the “Performance Based Planning & 
Programming (PBPP)”, a performance- and outcome-
based program with the objective of investing in projects 
that will help achieve the national goals for 
transportation. Fixing America’s Surface Transportation 
Act of 2016 (FAST Act) carries forward the same 
performance 
management 
framework. 
 
The 
Performance Based Planning framework is closely 
related to performance measurement and target-setting 
work that has been part of SJCOG’s work program for 
many years, including the Regional Transportation Plan 
(RTP), Regional Congestion Management Program 
(RCMP), and Regional Transportation Impact Fee (RTIF). 
Caltrans has identified a new requirement for 
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to include 
Performance Based Planning as a separate work element 
in the Overall Work Program (OWP), which SJCOG 
included for FY 19/20.2 
 
 Performance Measure (PM)  
Beginning in 2018, State Departments of Transportation 
(DOTs) and MPOs is required to implement the Federal 
1 U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration, 
https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/map21/ 
performance measures. These Federal performance 
measures are thematically split into under the rubric of 
“Performance Management” (PM): 
• 
PM 1: Roadway Safety 
• 
PM 2: Transportation Asset Management 
• 
PM 3: System Reliability, Freight, Congestion, 
and Air Quality 
For each set of performance measures, Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) has issued a Final Federal Rule 
identifying the performance metrics that State DOTs and 
MPOs are responsible to asses. The State DOTs (e.g. 
Caltrans) are directly responsible to submit performance 
targets and periodic reports on progress to those targets 
to Federal agencies on an annual basis. The first year of 
required target setting for the three performance 
measure categories (PM 1-3) is 2018, and FHWA will 
review each state DOT’s annual performance in relation 
to their 2018 targets. 
Caltrans Performance Management (PM) Targets 
Caltrans established multiple workshops and/or advisory 
committees via in person on phone with MPOs during 
the development of statewide PM targets. MPOs, such as 
SJCOG, are required to establish targets for the same 
performance measures on all public roads in the MPO 
planning area within 180 days after the state establishes 
each target. The MPO may elect to support the statewide 
targets, establish numerical targets specific to their 
region, or use a combination of both approaches.2 SJCOG 
elected to support the statewide target rather than 
establishing a region-specific numerical target for PM 1 
through 3.  
These performance measures serve as indicators for 
each PM and are updated on an annual basis, but at 
present time are not intended to set targets. SJCOG 
reported the region’s performance through the 
performance measures of each PM and is not required to 
directly assess their contribution to statewide targets of 
each performance measure. 
2 Caltrans Target Reporting Forms PM1, PM2, & PM3 
Performance Based Planning and Programming 
(PBPP) provides a greater level of transparency 
and accountability, improved project decision-
making, and more efficient investment of State 
and Federal transportation funds.

SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY TRANSPORTATION 
SYSTEM 
San Joaquin County’s Transportation system supports 
personal vehicles, freight trucks, buses, trains, bicyclists, 
and pedestrians. 
Regional Roadway Network 
San Joaquin County’s regional roadway includes three 
interstate freeways (I-205, I-580, and I-5), six state routes 
(SR-4, SR-12, SR-33, SR-88, SR-99, SR-120, and SR-132), 
and numerous local roadways. San Joaquin County 
residents and goods are transported along this regional 
roadway network to access within and neighboring 
counties. Neighboring counties can access San Joaquin or 
adjacent county along this regional roadway network. 
Sacramento County accesses the San Francisco Bay Area, 
particularly Alameda and Santa Clara County, or vice 
versa along I-5, SR-99, SR-120, and/or I-205. Central 
Valley accesses Sacramento County along SR-99 or I-5. 
Central Valley, particularly Stanislaus and Merced 
Counties, accesses San Francisco Bay Area along SR-99, 
SR-120, I-580, I-5, and I-205.

Transit 
Bus and rail service operate in San Joaquin County. Rail 
service is provided by Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) 
3 San Joaquin Regional Transit District, http://sanjoaquinrtd.com/rtdgo/ 
and bus service is provided by various providers. Most 
jurisdictions maintain their own bus service.  
Tracer serves City of Tracy  
Grapeline serves City of Lodi 
Manteca Transit serves City of Manteca 
E-Trans serves City of Escalon 
Blossom Express serves City of Ripon 
Regional Transit District (RTD) serves primarily 
serves City of Stockton and San Joaquin County 
while also operating in Cities of Lodi, Lathrop, 
Tracy, and Ripon. 
Transit access is also available from/to areas outside of 
San Joaquin County; including RTD’s bus service and 
ACE’s rail service to/from Alameda and Santa Clara 
County, bus service to/from Stanislaus County via 
Blossom Express and Modesto Area Express (MAX), and 
bus/rail service to/from various areas outside of San 
Joaquin County via Amtrak or Greyhound. Please see the 
Reference Section for each transit provider’s link. 
Rideshare, like Uber or Lyft, are available in or out of San 
Joaquin County. RTD funds 50% (up to $5.00) of your 
Uber ride if starting or ending outside of RTD’s service 
area or at specific transit centers between 4AM & 10AM 
and 4PM & 10PM.3 In addition, RTD started an on-
demand service, called “Van Go,” which transports up to 
4 people anywhere within a set zone between 6AM to 
6PM Monday through Friday and 6AM to 10PM Saturday 
& Sunday. “Van Go” program has a set fee for one-way 
trips and unlimited trips daily, with a transfer to a RTD 
fixed route being free.4 
Bicycle Facilities 
As of 2018, there are approximately 282 miles of bicycle 
lanes in San Joaquin County; including bicycle paths 
(Class 1), bicycle lanes (Class 2), and shared lane (Class 3). 
An additional 875 miles of bicycle lanes are planned in 
the future.

Goods Movement 
Goods movement is vital for economic vitality and 
growth in San Joaquin County. Goods can be moved 
along existing roadway system via trucks, along 
waterways via boats, and along railroad system via train.  
Roadway System – Trucks can travel along any 
roadway/highway, 
deemed 
part 
of 
Surface 
Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) route.  
Waterways – Boats can travel along waterways between 
San Francisco Bay Area and Port of Stockton, northwest

SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY DEMOGRAPHICS 
Current and historical population and employment 
numbers, along with current commute patterns, 
illustrate the existing conditions and may better foresee 
future transportation infrastructure projects in San 
Joaquin County. 
Population / Employment 
Current data estimates San Joaquin County’s population 
was 760,310 and employment was 253,099 in 2018. 
Population increased 99,425 from 2006 due to the 
increasing numbers of new births along with new 
residents from outside of San Joaquin County and United 
States. Since July 2013, more people have been entering 
rather than leaving San Joaquin County, especially from 
out of county or state.

Employment increased 31,360 between 2006 to 2018. 
San Joaquin County experienced reduced employment 
numbers between 2008 to 2011, which aligns with the 
unemployment rate. Unemployment increased since 
2006 and spiked at 16.5% in 2010, where unemployment 
gradually continued to decrease over the years. 
Commute Patterns 
San Joaquin County residents primarily drove alone 
(80.01%) or carpooled (12.68%) to work. The remainder 
worked from home (3.60%), walked/biked (1.56%), used 
public transit (1.59%), or took taxi/other (0.56%).

PM 1 - ROADWAY SAFETY 
Caltrans established statewide performance targets in 
accordance 
with 
FHWA’s 
Safety 
Performance 
Management Final Rule as an implementation of the 
Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP). These 
statewide targets address fatalities and serious injuries 
of motorize and non-motorized accidents on roads in San 
Joaquin County (Table 1). 
These performance targets are the result of Safety 
Performance Management Workshops in 2017 and 2018 
between Caltrans and MPOs, where MPOs supplied 
feedback to Caltrans on PM 1 targets. The results of 
March 13, 2018 workshop selected a scenario that aligns 
2015-2019 Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) and 
helps California reach zero fatalities by 2050 with 2016 
as a starting point.5  2020-2024 SHSP is in development 
and should instill the same “zero deaths by 2050” goal.  
Caltrans, with help from Office of Traffic Safety, 
established and reported three performance measures 
(i.e. number of fatalities, number of serious injuries, and 
rate of fatalities) to National Highway Safety 
Administration. In addition, rate of serious injuries and 
number of non-motorized serious injuries and fatalities 
5 Caltrans, Safety Performance Management Targets for 2019 
were reported to Federal Highway Administration on 
August 31, 2018. 
SJCOG PM 1 Compliance 
SJCOG simulated Caltrans’ methodology by accessing 
the data sources, found in Caltrans’ 2019 California 
Performance Management (PM1) Safety MPO Target 
Reporting Template, to report the most comparable 
stats for San Joaquin County. The three data sources 
include Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System 
(SWITRS), Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), 
and Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS). 
It should be noted that there was no mention of FARS 
data being part of the methodology for non-motorized 
serious injuries and fatalities in Safety Performance 
Management Targets for 2019, resulting in SWITRS data 
being used for fatalities in lieu of FARS data. 
Table 2: PM 1 Data Source 
Findings 
Aligning with the statewide goal of reaching zero 
fatalities by 2050, 2016 was selected at the starting 
point for this analysis. 2018 was the most current 
observation year reported by all data sources at this 
time. 
There were 107 fatalities, 419 serious injuries, and 95 
non-motorized serious injuries and fatalities. Of 95 non-
motorized accidents, 57 were serious injuries and 38 
were fatalities. Fatality rate (per 100 million vehicle miles 
traveled (VMT)) was 1.57 and serious injury rate (per 100 
million VMT) was 6.17.

Importance Of SJCOG Contribution 
The increase in serious injuries and non-motorized 
fatalities/serious injuries supports the need for SJCOG 
establishing safety-related policies and programs, along 
with improved communication and coordination with 
stakeholders.  
2018 
Regional 
Transportation 
Plan/Sustainable 
Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS) for San Joaquin County 
established one safety-related policy that includes two 
strategies. 
Strategy #9 – Facilitate projects that reduce the 
number of and severity of traffic incidents  
 Strategy #10 – Encourage and support projects 
that increase safety and security.6  
These strategies are captured in SJCOG’s Active 
Transportation program, Alternative Transportation 
program, and many other programs. In addition, SJCOG 
funding of various alternative transportation projects, 
like active transportation project funding.

Number of Fatalities 
Number of fatalities were accounted annually by FARS. In 2018, the five-year rolling average was 104 fatalities with 107 
observed during the same year. The five-year rolling average includes two years of decreasing fatalities and three years of 
increasing fatalities. Figure 6: Historical Number of Fatalities (2005 -2018) illustrates annual fatalities in blue and five-
year rolling average in orange.  The number of fatalities decreased by 9 since 2017.

Annual Fatality Rate (per 100 million VMT) 
 
Annual fatality rate accounted for the number of fatalities per 100 million miles driven. In 2018, the rolling average was 
1.57 of 1.57 annual fatality rate per 100 million VMT (AFR/100M) observed during the same year. AFR/100M was 
calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by VMT. Number of fatalities can vary yearly while VMT steadily increases 
over the years. AFR/100M reduced by 0.14 since 2017.

PM 2 – TRANSPORTATION ASSET 
MANAGEMENT (TAM) 
Caltrans’ Transportation Asset Management Plan 
(TAMP) established national performance measures for 
pavement and bridges with statewide targets in 
accordance with Federal Regulation (23 U.S.C. 150). 10 
years of data are assessed, from 2017/18 to 2027/28, 
with 2-year (Table 3) & 4-year targets to determine its 
progress toward 10-year goal.7 The availability of Senate 
Bill 1 (SB1) and local measure funding is anticipated to 
improve current pavement and bridge conditions along 
National Highway System (NHS) per Caltran’s TAMP.8 
NHS includes interstates and other roadways of national 
importance to mobility, defense, and economy.    
Table 3: Caltrans Adopted TAM Performance Targets 
Source: 2018 Caltrans Target Setting Methodology for PM2 – National 
Highway System Pavement & Bridge Targets, 5/21/18 Caltrans Statewide 
PM2 Target Letter 
Caltrans held a workshop with MPOs to introduce a 
preliminary methodology for establishing 10-year NHS 
pavement and bridge targets in August 2017. A follow-up 
letter requested MPOs select a target methodology in 
September 2017. Caltrans accessed 2017 State Highway 
System Management Plan (SHSMP) deterioration rates 
and unit costs from 2016 Local Streets and Roads Needs 
Assessment as factors in determining the targets, based 
on level of available funding.  
5/21/18 PM2 Caltrans statewide target letter included 
current pavement conditions (2016) and bridge 
conditions (2017) with 2-year targets (1/1/18-12/31/19) 
and 4-year targets (1/1/20-12/31/21).

Rating System Explained 
Pavement and bridge conditions are rated either a 
“Good,” “Fair,” or “Poor.” “Good” suggests no need for 
major investment and “Poor” suggests the need for 
major reconstruction investment. Pavement conditions 
are measured by 1) International Roughness Index 
(inches/mil), 2) Cracking (%), 3) Rutting (inches), and 4) 
Faulting (inches) (Figure 11).

SJCOG PM 2 Compliance 
Caltran’s Transportation Asset Management website, 
http://www.dot.ca.gov/assetmgmt/pm2.html, provided 
the guidance on pavement and bridge measures. 
Pavement data was unavailable online and had to be 
requested 
from 
Caltrans. 
Caltrans 
provided 
“2016_NHS_CA_2” dataset for pavement conditions.  
Bridge data was found online, under “Local Agency 
Bridge Inventory List” for 2018. 
In 2019/20, SJCOG staff was unable to access updated 
versions of previously collected pavement and bridge 
data. Caltrans was contacted for an updated pavement 
condition dataset, but could not provide one. SJCOG staff 
decided to defer updating pavement conditions for a 
year and use 2016 Caltrans dataset. In addition, SJCOG 
staff found the Local Bridge Inventory List” was removed 
from Caltrans’ website. SJCOG staff found Federal 
Highway Administration’s LTBP InfoBridge database an 
acceptable replacment. This database includes bridge 
conditions (i.e. Good, Fair, Poor) between 1993 and 
2018.  
Findings 
As dictated by in Caltrans statewide 2018 target letter, 
2016 was selected as the starting point for this analysis. 
Pavement data was only available for 2016 and only 
available from Caltrans staff. Through a new bridge 
database, SJCOG can report from 2016 to 2018 
conditions. A comparative assessment for pavement 
conditions may be performed in the next performance 
report. 
Pavement Conditions 
Caltrans “2016_NHS_CA_2” was augmented to separate 
interstate from the remainder of NHS on-file. Only 
interstates in San Joaquin County include I-5, I-205, and 
I-580. The results found 33% of pavement conditions 
along NHS to be “Good,” 61% “Fair,” and 7% “Poor.”

Bridge conditions worsened between 2016 and 2018, 
with a 18% decrease in “Good” condition bridges and 8% 
increase in “Poor” condition. Pavement conditions were 
unavailable for 2018; however, there were concerns on 
the 7% interstate and 7% non-interstate highways in 
“Poor” condition in 2016.  Thus; SJCOG established

resulting in the establishing the 2-year and 4 -year PM3 
performance targets along with current conditions 
(2017). 
Truck Travel Time Reliability Index Explained 
Under the federal final rule, FHWA preserved the level of 
travel time reliability (LOTTR) for freight trucks. In 
addition, FHWA set the truck travel time reliability 
threshold at 1.50, which signifies truck travel times 
below 1.50 are deemed reliable. 1.50 truck travel time 
reliability occurs when the travel time exceeds 50% of 
expected travel during non-commute (i.e. 7-9 AM, 4-6 
PM) times. For more information, please refer to 
https://www.federalregister.gov,

SJCOG PM 3 Compliance 
Caltrans established a website (https://npmrds.iteris-
pems.com/npmrds/) 
for 
Metropolitan 
Planning 
Organizations (MPO) to access monthly reliability 
percentages for commuters and freight truck drivers. 
The 
average of monthly reliability percentages between 
January and December generated the annual reliability 
percentage.  
CMAQ pollution reduction statistics account for the 
categories within the target. These statistics are 
provided by CMAQ program manager at SJCOG, found in

Annual travel reliability along non-interstate of NHS 
increased between 2018 and 2019 in San Joaquin 
County. SJCOG RTP/SCS supplied policies that support 
the improvement of travel reliability in San Joaquin 
County. Additional information about those strategies 
can be found in the next section (i.e. Importance of 
SJCOG Contribution).

Annual freight reliability decreased between 2018 and 
2019 in San Joaquin County, warranting the need for 
investments into goods movement system. Additional 
information about strategies that improve the goods 
movement system can be found in the next section (i.e. 
Importance of SJCOG Contribution).

San Joaquin County, along with other counties within 
San Joaquin Valley, is one of nation’s largest agricultural 
producers. In addition, San Joaquin Valley plays a vital 
role in logistics for many companies in San Francisco 
Bay Area due to the “relatively inexpensive land and 
low cost labor, good access to the national retail and 
interstate highway networks, connections to major 
deepwater ports in Oakland, and proximity to major 
consumer markets.”10 
  
Pollution Reduction – CMAQ 
SJCOG, as administrator of CMAQ program, funds 
transportation projects for the purpose of relieving 
traffic congestion and reducing car/truck emissions in 
San Joaquin County. SJCOG’s fiscal year starts July 1st and 
end June 30th.  
There were 14 program/projects in 18/19 fiscal year. 
SJCOG’s DIBs program, Travel Demand Management 
(TDM) program for San Joaquin and Merced County, 
received CMAQ funding. The remainder of the projects 
lie primarily within the City of Stockton. A complete 
summary of emission reductions, except Carbon Oxide 
(CO), was generated. Only a few jurisdictions reported 
CO emission reductions.

volatile organic compound (VOC), 0.25 kg/day in carbon 
oxide (CO), 16.86 kg/day in nitrous oxide (NOx), 8.90 
kg/day in particulate matter (PM) 10, 6.77 kg/day in PM

2.5 in fiscal year 2018/19. Pollutant emission reductions 
reduced by 8.03 kg/day in VOC, 8.27 kg/day in CO, 6.05 
kg/day in NOx, 1.03 kg/day in PM 10, and 0.76 kg/day in 
PM 2.5 since last fiscal year (2016/17).  
Importance Of SJCOG Contribution 
Annual travel reliability along interstates reducing by 2%, 
0.04 increase for annual freight unreliability,  and 
reduction in total emission reductions thru CMAQ  
supports the need for SJCOG establishing policies and 
programs, along with improved communication and 
coordination with stakeholders.  
2018 RTP/SCS for San Joaquin County established 
multiple travel reliability and pollutant-related policies 
with multiple strategies: 
Strategy #3 – Improve Air Quality by Reducing 
Transportation-Related Emissions 
Strategy #4 – Improve Regional Transportation 
System Efficiency 
Strategy #8 – Improve Major Transportation 
Corridors to Minimize Impacts on Rural Roads 
Strategy #12 – Optimize Existing Transportation 
System Capacity through Available and/on 
Innovative Strategies 
Strategy #14 – Encourage System Efficiency 
with Transportation Improvements that 
Facilitate Improvements in the Jobs/Housing 
Balance 
Strategy #15 – Improvement Transportation 
Options Linking Residents to Employment 
Centers within and out of the County       
Strategy #16 – Improve Freight Access to Key 
Strategic Economic Centers 
These strategies are applied to all projects that SJCOG 
reviews and supplies funding toward. For example, SR-
120 and SR-99 interchange project has the ability to 
apply all the above strategies.  
In relation to Goods Movement, SJCOG holds a 
multitude of private and public partnerships to be stay 
ahead of the growing demands of an everchanging 
goods movement industry. A couple examples of those 
partnerships includes SJCOG’s Goods Movement Task 
Force and West Coast Corridor Coalition.   
In addition, SJCOG has partnered with other 
neighboring MPOs for the purpose of generating this 
“mega region,” which improves the chance of receiving 
funding from the state. SJCOG is part of two “mega 
regions.” First “mega region” consists of Sacramento 
Council of Governments (SACOG), SJCOG, Metropolitan 
Transportation Commission (MTC), and Association of 
Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG). Second 
“mega region’ consists of 8 counties of San Joaquin 
Valley; including SJCOG, Stanislaus COG, Kern COG, 
Tulare COG, Fresno COG, Kings County Association of 
Governments (KCAG), Madera County Transportation 
Commission (MCTC), and Merced County Association of 
Governments (MCAG). 
San Joaquin Valley “Mega Region” produced the 2013 
San Joaquin Valley Interregional Goods Movement Plan 
provides a priority list of  highway capacity projects 
along with set a recommendation to prepare for MAP-
21 actions; including: 
Table 9: Recommendation #1 of San Joaquin Valley Interregional 
Goods Movement Plan 
Provision 
Action 
Establishes National 
Freight Policy 
Establishes a national freight policy, including 
establishing goals for national investment into 
freight infrastructure. 
National Freight 
Strategic Plan 
Calls for development of a National Freight 
Strategic Plan, that would assess the condition 
and performance of the national freight highway 
network. This requires the USDOT to identify 
highway bottlenecks, issues, and major trade 
corridors. 
State Freight 
Advisory Committee 
and State Freight 
Plans 
Encourages states to establish freight advisory 
committees, and develop state freight plans. 
National Freight 
Network 
Calls for the establishment of a National Freight 
Network. This network would consist of a 
primary network established by the FHWA, but 
also portions of the interstate system and critical 
rural freight corridors.

University of California Berkeley established SafeTrec, or Safe Transportation Research and Education Center in 2000. 
SafeTrec’s emphasis is on 1) Data Analysis and Data Tools, 2) Technology for Road Safety, and 3) Policy Analysis and 
Community Outreach.1 SafeTrec’ Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS) illustrates Statewide Integrated Traffic 
Records System (SWITRS) data. TIMS allows the user to filter criteria, like collision severity, with some limitations. One 
important limitation is TIMS inability to filter more than three criteria of a specific type at one time.  
SJCOG staff accessed SafeTrec’ TIMS to 
compare severe injuries from 2018 to 2019 and 
was able to generate four scenarios in San 
Joaquin County (for comparison purposes): 1) 
Severe injuries (SI) collisions, 2) Motorized SI 
collisions, 3) Motorized SI collisions along 
interstates, United States (US) highways, & 
state routes in San Joaquin County, and 3) 
Motorized SI collisions on weekdays along interstates, US highways, & state routes in San Joaquin County. Heat maps, 
illustrating the results of the above queries, are shown below. These heat maps illustrate the density of occurrences per 
each query. For instance, heat maps for 2018 serious injuries in San Joaquin County illustrate most collisions occurred in 
City of Stockton. Note: Heat maps do not include collisions where there was no indication of what the motor vehicle was 
involved.

Overview 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
98
League of California Cities generated biennial California Statewide Local Streets and Roads Needs Assessment report(s). 
Started in 2008, these reports were meant to determine the funding needed to maintain the roadways and bridges over 
the next 10 years. This appendix summarizes the findings of 2018 report; in relation to:  
 
 
Average Pavement Condition Index (PCI) for San Joaquin County 
 
San Joaquin County PCI in comparison to neighboring counties 
 
10‐year funding need for pavement and bridge in San Joaquin County 
 
Compare San Joaquin County’s 10‐year funding need for pavement and bridge to neighboring counties 
 
Sufficiency Rating (SR) for San Joaquin County 
 
For more information, please refer to http://www.savecaliforniastreets.org. 
 
Pavement 
Pavement Condition Index (PCI) is the rating system for pavement 
conditions, 0 being the worst condition and 100 being the best condition. 
A rating of 25 or less PCI requires reconstruction of street. A rating of 25 
to 69 PCI requires a thin or thick overlay of hot mix asphalt (HMA). Lastly, 
a rating of 70 or over PCI means preventive measures were invoked to 
ensure the longevity of pavement. This report includes the average PCI for 
San Joaquin County and even each jurisdiction after 2014.

Summary 
 
2018 California Statewide Local Streets and Roads Needs Assessment report indicates the average PCI for San Joaquin 
County was 70 in 2018; which means no action is needed. Neighboring counties require thin HMA overlay; including 
Alameda, Contra Costa, Sacramento, and Stanislaus. Only Contra Costa County received a similar average PCI (71). Other 
than Stanislaus County (5,989 lane miles (LM)), San Joaquin County has the lowest number of LM of previously named 
counties at 6,773 LM. Sacramento County has the highest number of LM (11,041), followed by Alameda (8,088 LM) and 
Contra Costa (7,159 LM). These factors are accounted in the estimated funding needed to preserve the existing 
pavement conditions per County. San Joaquin County needs the least amount at approximately $1,226 million.    
 
 
 
 
Bridges 
Sufficiency Rating (SR) is the rating system for “bridge's fitness for the duty that it performs based on factors derived 
from multiple NBI data fields, including fields that describe its structural evaluation, functional obsolescence, and its

SUBJECT: 
Regional Transportation Impact Fee (RTIF) 
Capital Project List Amendments 
 
 
 
 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
Approve Amendments to 2017 RTIF 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
The Regional Transportation Impact Fee (RTIF) is a countywide, multi-jurisdictional capital 
improvement funding program. SJCOG has received a request from the City of Tracy for an 
amendment to the RTIF Program that will revise the project costs for the following two interchange 
projects that are on the Project List.

Update Cost 
 
Amendments to the RTIF are routine because the next major update will not be until 2022. The 
project costs of the interchanges are much higher since the plan adoption three years ago. This 
necessitated a recalculation to determine the maximum RTIF eligible costs for the two interchanges 
which could be eligible for RTIF collected by City of Tracy for projects within City of Tracy. The 
program’s objective is to offset the effects of development on the regional transportation network 
through an impact fee. These funds can be used with federal, state, and other local funding to make 
transportation improvements that increase regional mobility and reduce congestion.  
These amendments are described in greater detail below.  
 
RECOMMENDATION: 
 
SJCOG staff recommends the approval of the amendment to the 2017 RTIF. 
 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
 
This action will increase the RTIF-eligible project cost of the I-205/Mountain House Parkway 
interchange from $256,715 to $3,395,051, and the I-580/International Parkway/Patterson Road 
interchange from $1,486,298 to $7,951,697 allowing the City of Tracy to expend additional RTIF 
on the project.

This action will not affect the ongoing costs of administering the RTIF nor will it affect the fee rates 
assessed by member agencies on development projects. 
BACKGROUND:  
Program Background 
The Regional Transportation Impact Fee (RTIF) program was established in October 2005, and was 
comprehensively updated in 2011 and 2017. A revised Operating Agreement was adopted April 
2015 and fully executed during the 2015-2016 fiscal year.  
The RTIF program’s objective is to generate funding from new development projects that impact 
the regional transportation network and integrate these funds with federal, state, and other local 
funding to make transportation improvements identified in the RTIF Program. It is a countywide, 
multi-jurisdictional capital improvement funding program.  
The RTIF Program was comprehensively updated in April 2017.  Since the adoption of the 2017 
RTIF update, the SJCOG Board has approved an amendment to the RTIF in 2018 that revised the 
project costs for two projects and added four additional projects to the RTIF Capital Project List. 
 
Each jurisdiction contributes into the RTIF program via residential and non-residential development 
permit fees. The RTIF program fee structure is set according to a nexus analysis that links the 
transportation impacts of new development projects to a “fair share” of project costs designed to 
mitigate those impacts. The fee is uniform across all participating agencies.   Based on Section 3.2 
from the RTIF Operating Agreement, the region-wide RTIF structure is annually adjusted by each 
Participating Agency at the beginning of each fiscal year (July 1) based on the Engineering News 
Record California Construction Code Index (CCCI). 
Update to I-205/Mountain House Parkway Interchange and I-580/International 
Parkway/Patterson Pass Road Interchange Project Costs 
 
The City of Tracy submitted a letter to SJCOG on April 18, 2019 requesting an amendment to the 
Regional Transportation Impact Fee (RTIF) program to update the Gross Project Cost for the 
following two interchange projects. 
 
*Denotes the figure is subject to approval by SJCOG Board at its June 2020 meeting.

Since the last RTIF update, the projects have been better defined and updated cost estimates have 
been prepared. The requested update to the Gross Project Cost will also update the RTIF Eligible 
Cost (defined as a percentage of the Gross Project Cost), allowing Tracy to commit additional funds 
on the projects and be better positioned to fulfill local match requirements for state and federal grant 
opportunities.  
 
Based on the information provided, SJCOG completed a minor revision to the RTIF Nexus Analysis 
to increase the combined gross project cost for the two projects from $13,000,000 to $101,050,000, 
resulting in an increase in the RTIF-eligible project cost from $1,743,013 to $11,346,748. 
 
As of December 31, 2019, the City of Tracy had an RTIF Fund Balance of $11,243,471.74 as 
reported in their Fiscal Year 2019/2020 Semi-Annual Report #1. In this report, the City of Tracy 
did not commit any RTIF funding to their projects. At their discretion, the City can commit their 
RTIF Fund Balance toward the RTIF Eligible Maximum Contribution of the two interchange 
projects.
