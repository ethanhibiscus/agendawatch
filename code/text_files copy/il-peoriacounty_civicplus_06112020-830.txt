Re:  Budget Amendment for COVID-19 Contact Tracing Grant.

individuals that test positive for the virus, and;  
 
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has allocated funding to the Peoria City/County Health Department 
up to $4,905,792.00 for the 12-month period starting June 1, 2020 to perform contact tracing, and; 
 
WHEREAS, the Peoria City/County Health Department’s award is substantially greater than other 
local health departments due to the healthcare infrastructure present in Peoria between OSF Healthcare and 
UnityPoint Healthcare, and; 
 
WHEREAS, contact tracing will be imperative to keeping the community’s healthcare infrastructure 
capacity manageable and informed over the next 12 months, and; 
 
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department of Public Health itemized nine objectives tied back to the grant

achieve goals for each of the nine objectives, and;
