NOTICE OF ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS MEETING 
 
The Royal Oak Zoning Board of Appeals will hold a regular meeting on Thursday, June 11, 2020 at 7:00 pm. 
 
On March 10, 2020, Governor Whitmer issued Executive Order 2020-04, which declared a state-wide state of 
emergency due to the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus 
that had not been previously identified in humans, can spread easily from person to person, and can result in 
serious illness or death. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, to protect the public health, and provide essential 
protections to vulnerable Michiganders, it is crucial that all Michiganders take steps to limit in-person contact. 
The critical mitigation measures include social distancing and limiting the number of people interacting at public 
gatherings. Therefore, the June 11, 2020 Royal Oak Zoning Board of Appeals Meeting will be held 
electronically, in compliance with the Michigan Open Meetings Act and Executive Order 2020-75, as issued by 
Governor Whitmer on May 6, 2020.
