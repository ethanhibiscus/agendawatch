Budget Reduction Discussion 
BOARD OF SUPERVISOR RESOLUTION: 
2% Reduction = $466,935  
5% Reduction = $1,167,338  
8% Reduction = $1,867,740  
10% Reduction = $2,334,675 
CONSIDERATIONS: 

School Board amended budget level funding line items at FY 2020 total.

Variable Costs in School Board budget is less $1,998,609

Technology equipment is included in Variable Costs, so if we don't spend at least $278,400 we will lose
$232,000 in State revenue. Also, likelihood of distance learning for foreseeable future necessitates
technology spending.

SunTribe Solar savings for FY 2021 = $15,273 (ref. School Board meeting 5/14/2019

TRANE EPC savings for year 1 = $2,752 to $17,377
NOTE: Currently these energy savings roll over to School's CIP Reserve fund at year end and pay
toward debt service for TRANE

Year end funds of approximately $980,000
NOTE:  Creation of Revenue Stabilization Fund using these dollars
NON-PERSONNEL REDUCTION OPTIONS: 
1.
10% cut to all material & supply budgets (schools, departments, O&M repairs) 
$97,234
2.
Restrict all non-essential travel
$29,276 
3.
Eliminate Field Trips (Driver pay and fuel)
$74,127 
4.
Eliminate all Athletic, Extra-Curricular and Co-Curricular Activities
$298,247 
TOTAL
 $498,884 
PERSONNEL REDUCTION OPTIONS:  Reduction In Force (calculated at step 5 & FICA for all positions, 
other benefit savings needed to pay unemployment costs)  
1.
Teacher (10-month w/masters)
$54,514 
2.
Instructional Assistant
$18,280 
3.
Clerical
$30,772 
4.
Trades (maintenance/mechanic)
$32,938 
5.

$17,420

% reduction in line 
with overall cuts.  Already reduced staffing by one Director position saving $84,744 
Based on 5% reduction from county at $1,167,338 minus all non-personnel reductions listed ($498,484) above 
we would have to reduce personnel by $668,454. To provide context only, this scenario would equate 
to laying off 13 Teachers or 36 Instructional Assistants
