A. RESOLUTION 2020-M AUTHORIZING THE CITY MANAGER TO EXECUTE 
THE LPA AGREEMENT AND ALL OTHER NECESSARY DOCUMENTS WITH ODOT 
FOR THE RESURFACING OF BELLBROOK AVENUE (FROM MAUMEE DRIVE TO 
PEACEPIPE TRAIL), AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY. City Manager Brent 
Merriman said in October 2019, the City of Xenia applied for and was awarded Surface 
Transportation Program (STP) Resurfacing funds through MVRPC to rehabilitate Bellbrook 
Avenue from Maumee Drive to Peacepipe Trail in 2021. The City’s engineering estimate for this 
project is $427,334. The STP grant specifies a 69% (Federal)/31% (Local) split for funding this 
project, which results in the City of Xenia being responsible for a local share match of $132,473. 
The City of Xenia will be overseeing the construction of these improvements. Officials at ODOT 
have requested that City Council authorize the City Manager to execute a standard LPA Agreement 
XCC Meeting Minutes, May 28, 2020, Page 3 
 
 
and return it as soon as possible in order to maintain the intended project schedule. Consequently, 
the City’s engineering staff requests that the Resolution be adopted on an emergency basis. 
 
President Smith entertained passage of Resolution 2020-M as presented. 
 
Motion by Mayor Mays, seconded by Vice President Wallace, to adopt Resolution 2020-M as 
presented. Brief discussion followed. Councilman Scrivens asked about the acronym LPA. 
Mr. Merriman said it stood for Local Public Agency. The Roll on this was the following: 
  
Ayes: Wallace, Scrivens, R. Dean, Brannum, L. Dean, Mays, Smith 
Nays: None  
motion carried.  
 
B. Introduction of Resolution 2020-N Amending Resolution 2019-N to Extend the Due 
Date of the Charter Review Commission’s Report to City Council. Law Director Donnette 
Fisher said on June 13, 2019, this Council passed Resolution 2019-N, which established and 
appointed the Charter Review Commission, as required by Section 8.05 of the City’s Charter. The 
membership of the Commission has been once amended, by Resolution 2020-B, passed on 
February 27, 2020. In Resolution 2019-N, Council also designated a July 1, 2020, deadline by 
which the Commission is to file its report on any recommendations it makes regarding any 
amendments, additions, revisions or alterations to the City’s Charter for presentation to the voters. 
While the Commission is three quarters done with its review, due to the coronavirus pandemic, a 
July 1st due date for the Commission’s final report is unrealistic at this time as the Commission 
has not been able to meet for several months. Due to the unpredictability of the pandemic and what 
protocols will have to be followed through the summer and into the fall, presentation to the voters 
in November 2020 seems unlikely. Further, several “town hall” meetings are needed to meet with 
the City’s citizens to explain any changes recommended to the Charter before such changes are 
presented to the voters for their consideration. Thus, it appears at this time that the November 2021 
election is a more realistic goal. She respectfully requested introduction and eventual passage of 
Resolution 2020-N to push back the due date for the Charter Review Commission’s report to 
Council from July 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021. 
 
President Smith entertained introduction of Resolution 2020-N as presented. 
 
Councilman Scrivens presented RESOLUTION 2020-N AMENDING RESOLUTION 2019-N 
TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE OF THE CHARTER REVIEW COMMISSION’S REPORT TO 
CITY COUNCIL, and it was read for the first time. 
 
C. Administrative Motion Authorizing the City Manager to Accept an Ohio 911 Local 
Subgrant for the Xenia/Greene Central Communications Center. Mr. Merriman said the 
Xenia/Greene Central Communications Center has been approved to receive federal funding 
through the State of Ohio totaling $170,922.74 from the Next Generation 911 Grant Program. The 
NG911 Grant Program provides grant resources for the implementation of 911 services and 
Enhanced-911 services; specifically for Xenia, the ability to migrate to an IP-enabled emergency 
network. Eligible expenditures for the grant include capital equipment, installation, and training 
among other line items. As the subrecipient, the City must provide no less than 40% local matching 
funds toward the total eligible estimated project cost. Staff had already planned for this platform 
migration having budgeted $350,000 for this fiscal year, so the federal funding allows them to 
retain local dollars for other 911-system expenses as the City’s local share will be just over 
XCC Meeting Minutes, May 28, 2020, Page 4 
 
 
$165,000.  He respectfully requested authorization to accept the Ohio 911 Local Subgrant for the 
Xenia/Greene Central Communications Center. 
 
President Smith entertained a motion. 
 
Motion by Councilman Scrivens, seconded by Vice President Wallace, to authorize the City 
Manager to accept the Ohio 911 Local Subgrant for the Xenia Greene Central Communications 
Center. Brief discussion followed. Vice President Wallace expressed his compliments to staff for 
always seeking grant dollars, noting that every dollar helps. President Smith concurred. The Roll 
on this was the following: 
  
Ayes: Wallace, Scrivens, R. Dean, Brannum, L. Dean, Mays, Smith 
Nays: None  
motion carried.  
 
D. Administrative Motion Approving the Schedule of Bills in the amount of $714,000.06. 
Mr. Duke respectfully requested the payment of bills in the amount of $714,000.06. 
 
President Smith entertained a motion. 
 
Motion by Mayor Mays, seconded by President Smith, to approve the schedule of bills in the 
amount of $714,000.06. No discussion followed. The Roll on this was the following:

Nays: None  
motion carried.  
 
11. APPOINTED OFFICIALS REPORTS AND COUNCIL COMMENTS:  
 
A. City Manager, Finance Director, and Law Director:  
 
Mr. Merriman shared the following:  
• 
City administrative offices will return to normal scheduling on Monday, June 1, and will be open 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday – Friday. Social distancing will continue to be practiced. 
• 
Also on June 1, Public Service Workers will commence bulk pickup and the splash pad will open 
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Unfortunately, due to the Governor’s orders, dry playgrounds cannot reopen 
just yet. Park bathrooms at Shawnee Park and Xenia Station will be cleaned twice per day, which 
with only one dedicated parks employee, that will be difficult to do. 
• 
Fireworks planning for July 3rd is underway; he anticipated making a formal announcement very 
soon. 
• 
Senior parade will be held on Friday, May 29th, at 6 p.m. Graduates will travel in their cars from 
the high school, down Detroit Street to W. Main Street, and the parade will disperse at Church 
Street. He encouraged family members to line the streets to support the graduates. He anticipated 
the parade would take 30-45 minutes and residents should expect traffic delays during that time. 
 
Mr. Duke and Ms. Fisher had nothing further to share.   
 
B. Mayor and City Council:  
 
Councilman Brannum congratulated the graduating seniors; he looks forward to the parade on 
Friday.   
 
XCC Meeting Minutes, May 28, 2020, Page 5 
 
 
Councilman Dean had nothing further to share 
 
Councilwoman Dean congratulated the graduating seniors; she hopes to attend the parade if her 
work schedule permits.   
 
Councilman Scrivens said he was glad to see the S. Detroit Street bridge design moving along (per 
the payment to American Structure Point on the Schedule of Bills). Also per the bills, he asked about 
the removal of biosolids by Hines Farming and if the biosolids were used as fertilizer. Mr. Merriman 
said biosolids can be landfilled or used as fertilizer, but if used as fertilizer, it is heavily regulated by 
Ohio EPA with a lot of restrictions. Hines Farming does sell it as fertilizer, but it alleviates the City 
of the burden of paying to dispose of it in a landfill, pay tipping fees, etc. Councilman Scrivens said 
street paving has started back up, and everybody wants their streets done. However, even if the City 
had the money, they could not pave all 120+ lane miles at the same time. He asked people to please 
be patient. He knows many Xenia streets need to be improved. He thanked the Xenia Police Division 
for a job well done, and he encouraged the people of Xenia to hang in there. Xenia should be an 
ambassador for the rest of the country to show how everyone can live together and get along. 
 
Vice President Wallace congratulated all graduating seniors from all local high schools and those 
graduating from local colleges and universities. He concurred with Councilman Scrivens noting 
that what happened in Minneapolis is regrettable. He said people need to pray about the situation, 
and the destruction is not helping. God bless them all. He asked when the roundabout would 
officially open. Mr. Merriman said most of the work is complete, but there are a few punch list 
items left to complete. They are waiting for Greene County Building Inspection to inspect and 
approve the new traffic lights, which he anticipated would occur within the next few days. Once 
approved, the roundabout would open within 24 hours thereafter. He noted they are still inside the 
90-day construction window. Councilman Scrivens said they are adding the signage and striping 
now. President Smith said the roundabout is an important artery in this community, and he was 
ready for it to reopen. 
 
Mayor Mays said she was looking forward to tomorrow’s parade to honor and congratulate the 
Class of 2020. She commented on the upcoming 88th Air Base Wing change of command on 
June 12th and thanked outgoing Colonel Sherman and his wife, Lori, for their work. She noted they 
came to Xenia to get to know this community, and their service has been very positive. She 
appreciates their service and work at WPAFB. She noted she did have a conversation with Xenia 
Police Chief Randy Person regarding the situation in Minneapolis because as a mother, her heart 
is broken. She has talked with Mr. Merriman and other XPD officers, and their hearts are broken 
also. They are grieving and sad, but they are adamant that the XPD has a wonderful relationship 
with this community. She applauded them for that, noting they welcome questions and will happily 
share the things they are doing, the training they have received, and the ways they interact with 
this community. She commended them—they are doing an outstanding job. She then shared 
Romans 8, verses 26-27.  
 
President Smith congratulated the Class of 2020 in Xenia and surrounding communities. This is 
an unprecedented time, and it is hard. From a position of leadership, he said leadership positions 
are hard, and they have to make tough decisions. Chances are half of the people won’t agree with 
those decisions. Regarding the upcoming school year, tough decisions will have to be made, and 
some people will like those decisions and some will not. He asked about the inadvertent sounding 
XCC Meeting Minutes, May 28, 2020, Page 6 
 
 
of tornado sirens earlier in the week. Mr. Merriman said it was basic human error. He was notified 
within seconds of the activation, and steps are being put in place so that it does not happen again. 
The error was immediately publicly acknowledged through the City’s public relations efforts, and 
he apologized for the inconvenience. President Smith said the next Council meeting would be on 
June 11th. He hoped all had a wonderful Memorial Day holiday. 
 
12. ADJOURNMENT: Motion by Mayor Mays, seconded by Councilwoman Dean, to adjourn

AMENDING RESOLUTION 2019-N TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE OF THE 
CHARTER REVIEW COMMISSION’S REPORT TO CITY COUNCIL 
 
Introduced by Councilman Scrivens on May 28, 2020 
 
 
Submitted By: 
Donnette Fisher, Law Director 
Presented By: 
Donnette Fisher, Law Director 
 
Scope/Description: 
On June 13, 2019, this Council passed Resolution 2019-N, which established and 
appointed the Charter Review Commission, as required by Section 8.05 of the 
City’s Charter. (The membership of the Commission has been once amended, by 
Resolution 2020-B, passed on February 27, 2020).   In Resolution 2019-N, 
Council also designated a July 1, 2020, deadline by which the Commission is to 
file its report on any recommendations it makes regarding any amendments, 
additions, revisions or alterations to the City’s Charter for presentation to the 
voters.  While the Commission is three quarters done with its review, due to the 
coronavirus pandemic, a July 1st due date for the Commission’s final report is 
unrealistic at this time as the Commission has not been able to meet for several 
months. 
 
 
Due to the unpredictability of the pandemic and what protocols will have to be 
followed through the summer and into the fall, presentation to the voters in 
November 2020 seems unlikely.  We need to have several “town hall” meetings 
and need to be able to meet with the City’s citizens to explain any changes 
recommended to the Charter before such changes are presented to the voters for 
their consideration.  Thus, it appears at this time that the November 2021 election 
is a more realistic goal.  
 
Recommendation: 
Due to the interruption of the meeting schedule of the Charter Review 
Commission, and due to the impracticalities of presenting any proposed changes 
to the City’s Charter to the voters in November 2020, staff is recommending 
Council push back due date for the Charter Review Commission’s report to 
Council from July 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021. 
 
CITY OF XENIA, OHIO 
RESOLUTION 2020 – N 
 
AMENDING RESOLUTION 2019-N, TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE OF THE CHARTER 
REVIEW COMMISSION’S REPORT TO CITY COUNCIL 
 
 
WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 8.05 of the Charter of the City of Xenia, this Council created a 
five- (5) member Charter Review Commission and appointed the members thereto by Resolution 2019-N, 
passed on June 13, 2019;  
 
WHEREAS, Resolution 2019-N also established a due date of July 1, 2020, by which date the 
Commission was to make its final report on any proposed amendments, revisions, alterations or additions 
to the City’s Charter to this Council;  
 
WHEREAS, due to the coronavirus pandemic July 1, 2020, is no longer a realistic goal for the 
Commission’s final report to this Council; and 
 
WHEREAS, Council finds its necessary to amend the due date of the Charter Review’s Commission 
final report set by Resolution 2019-N, 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY OF XENIA HEREBY RESOLVES, at least four (4) members of 
the City Council concurring, that: 
 
Section 1.  Resolution 2019-N, Section 2., is hereby amended as follows:  
 
The Charter Review Commission shall recommend to this Council such amendments, revisions, 
alterations or additions, if any, to the Xenia City Charter as in its judgment are advisable by 
report no later than April 30, 2021 July 1, 2020, unless the time for submitting the Commission’s 
report is extended by Council, by further Resolution. 
 
Section 2.  It is found that all formal actions of this Council concerning and relating to the 
adoption of this Resolution were adopted in an open meeting of this Council, and that all 
deliberations of this Council that resulted in this formal action were in meetings open to the

Ordinance 2020-05 
AMENDING THE OFFICIAL ZONING MAP OF THE CITY OF XENIA, 
OHIO, TO REZONE TWO PARCELS TOTALING 3.94 ACRES, MORE 
OR LESS, AT 774 CINCINNATI AVENUE FROM I-2, HEAVY 
INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT, TO B-3, GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICT 
Introduced by Vice President Wallace on March 12, 2020 
 
Submitted By: 
Brian Forschner, City Planner 
Presented By: 
Brent Merriman, City Manager 
 
 
 
Scope/Description: 
Greene County owns the subject property, which was formerly used as a 
maintenance facility for Greene County Parks and Trails, until they built a 
new consolidated facility on North Progress Drive.  The Fish Food Pantry 
now intends to move from its current location on Ledbetter Road into the 
subject property.  The existing building, which is approximately 8,352 square 
feet, contains adequate space for the food pantry’s existing operations as well 
as future expansion.  The food pantry is considered a retail sales use, which 
is not permitted by current I-2 zoning.  The applicant therefore must rezone 
the subject property before operating a food pantry there. 
 
 
The subject property is located adjacent to B-3 zoning to the north, which 
resulted from a multiple-property rezoning from I-2 during 2019.  The 
properties to the north and south are a mix of commercial, residential and 
light industrial uses.  To the east lies a residential neighborhood and the 
former Hooven and Allison property.  To the west is the Little Miami Scenic 
Trail, along with a mix of industrial and residential buildings. 
 
City staff found that the requested rezoning meets the majority of the Land 
Development Code’s zoning amendment approval criteria in Section 
1220.03(e).  The proposed rezoning is consistent with the intent of the Land 
Development Code and market trends in the Cincinnati Avenue corridor. 
Furthermore, the requested commercial zoning will be more compatible with 
surrounding zoning and uses than the existing heavy industrial zoning.  
 
Planning and Zoning Commission voted to endorse this rezoning on 
Thursday, March 5, 2020, after holding the required public hearing.  This 
ordinance was introduced on March 12, 2020, but the second reading and 
public hearing was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

RECOMMENDATION: It is the recommendation of staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission 
(3-0) that Council adopt this Ordinance to amend the City’s Zoning Map to

Avenue from I-2, Heavy Industrial District, to B-3, General Business 
District.

DETERMINING TO PROCEED WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF CITY 
STREETS AND PUBLIC WAYS BY THE LIGHTING THEREOF 
WITHIN STREET LIGHTING DISTRICT #5 FOR THE YEARS 2021-
2022 
 
Submitted By:  
Chris Berger, Public Service Director/City Engineer 
Presenter:  
Brent Merriman, City Manager 
 
 
 
Scope/Description: 
With the adoption of the new Zoning Code by City Council in 2016, a new 
requirement was established where a developer of a subdivision that is 
interested in including street lights within its subdivision must agree to a 
street light assessment for the benefitting lots within the subdivision. 
 
 
Accordingly, the developer (M One Development, LLC) for the Sterling 
Green Crossing Phase 4 Subdivision has received a cost to install ten (10) 
street lights, along with the monthly electricity fee per the City’s contract 
with Miami Valley Lighting (MVL).  The developer is responsible for the 
initial cost to install the lights, but the City of Xenia is responsible for paying 
the monthly electricity costs as it has been doing for many years on its other 
street lights.  
 
 
Council adopted the required Resolution of Necessity to establish Street 
Lighting District No. 5 on March 26, 2020.  This is the second step in the 
street lighting assessment process, and after the third and final step, a 
streetlight assessment will be included on the individual lot owners’ property 
tax duplicate from the Greene County Auditor. 
 
 
Based upon the City of Xenia’s current contract with MVL, and including the 
administrative fees associated with the continued assessment of each lot on a 
yearly basis, the owner of each lot within the Sterling Green Crossing Phase 
4 Subdivision would pay an annual fee of $33.53.  This street lighting 
assessment will be included on the individual lot owner’s property taxes.  We 
are recommending a two-year period on the assessments, as the assessments 
for Street Lighting District’s 1-4 will also expire in 2022.  This will allow us 
to renew the street lighting assessments for all five Districts at the same time.

RECOMMENDATION: It is the recommendation of City staff that this Ordinance be approved so that 
street lights may be installed in the Sterling Green Crossing Phase 4 
Subdivision, and the cost of lighting them will be covered through 2022.

AUTHORIZING THE SALE OF CITY-OWNED PROPERTY LOCATED AT 
895 LOUISE DRIVE TO PHILLIP STEVENS 
 
Submitted By: 
Jared Holloway, Assistant City Manager 
Presented By: 
Brent Merriman, City Manager 
 
 
Cover Memo: 
The Greene County Treasurer foreclosed on this parcel located at 895 Louise 
Drive in December 2014.  The City acquired the lot for $1,152.80.  Since then, 
there has been on-and-off discussion with adjacent property owners who were 
interested in expanding their side yards.  In late 2019, City staff listed for sale 
this lot and an additional lot owned by the City on Louise Drive with a local 
realtor.  The properties were offered for sale with the intent to put the properties 
back into private hands for the construction of a single-family home. 
 
 
For the lot at 895 Louise Drive, staff received the attached offer from Phillip 
Stevens, who would like to purchase the property for $19,000 to construct a 
single-family home.  Based on the offer, the City would be responsible for 
closing costs leaving estimated revenue of $17,522.  Staff recommends the sale 
of this property to Mr. Stevens, which will relieve the City from ongoing mowing 
maintenance and liability costs and promote additional residential investment in 
the City.
