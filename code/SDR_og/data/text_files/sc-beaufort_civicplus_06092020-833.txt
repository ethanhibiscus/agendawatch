A. Emergency Ordinance of the City of Beaufort, South Carolina – Ordinance directing Citizens and 
Residents within the City of Beaufort to Shelter in Place during the COVID-19 Emergency 
Declaration: and matters related thereto; and severability.  
 
Motion to approve made by Sutton and seconded by Murray. 
 
City Manager, Bill Prokop, gave an overview of the proposed ordinance for approval, stating 
that the ordinance is asking our citizens to stay at home.  
 
Councilman Murray stated that over the last 48 hours he has talked to a lot of residents and 
business owners about Shelter in Place and what Shelter in Place really means.  South Carolina 
for all intents and purposes, is in a shelter in place environment currently, to include some 
restrictions that other states do not have in place.  He continued to encourage citizens to stay 
home and read the details of the ordinance being proposed.  This ordinance is not to supersede 
what the Governor has already put in place, but it will go hand in hand with his orders and any 
other orders the Governor may bring forward.  
 
Mayor Pro Tem, Mike McFee, read the proposed Ordinance.  
 
Councilman Cromer echoed Councilman Murray’s sentiments.  He stated that this is a unique 
situation we find ourselves in and I am very pleased so far with the vast majority of our citizens 
trying to shelter in place.  This ordinance will help halt the spread of COVID-19. 
 
Councilwoman Sutton stated that she is ready to vote on it and stop talking about it.  We just 
need to do this, its unprecedented and it is about saving lives.  
 
Mayor Pro Tem, Mike McFee said that the elements of this ordinance are encouraging all of us 
to use common sense and recognize that the CDC (Center for Disease Control) and SCDHEC 
(South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control) are giving us the best 
information available out there.

Mayor Keyserling stated that the City’s will have a frequently asked questions document 
published on the City’s website regarding COVID-19.  He thanked the many in Beaufort that 
have been doing a good job and reiterated the purpose of the ordinance being proposed, which 
is to continue to stay home. The Mayor wanted to let citizens know that the goal is not to be 
heavy handed, but rather hold hands and tighten the circle where we all work together to do 
our best to flatten this thing out. 
Motion to approve was unanimous.

AN ORDINANCE AMENDING CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CODE OF 
ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF BEAUFORT, SOUTH CAROLINA, TO 
AUTHORIZE MEETINGS TO BE HELD BY TELEPHONIC OR OTHER 
ELECTRONIC MEANS, AND MATTERS RELATED THERETO. 
 
WHEREAS, the City of Beaufort, South Carolina (the “City”) is a municipal corporation of the 
State of South Carolina (the “State”) located in Beaufort County, South Carolina, and as such 
possesses all general powers granted by the Constitution and statutes of the State to such public 
entities;  
 
WHEREAS, Section 5-7-160 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina 1976, as amended (the “S.C. 
Code”) provides that “[a] majority of the total membership of the council shall constitute a quorum 
for the purpose of transacting council business”;  
 
WHEREAS, the Freedom of Information Act, which is codified at Title 30, Chapter 4 of the S.C. 
Code defines a meeting as “convening a quorum1 of the constituent membership of the public 
body, whether corporal or by means of electronic equipment, to discuss or act upon a matter over 
which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power” [emphasis added];  
 
WHEREAS, in keeping with the provisions of the S.C. Code, Section 1-3003(a) of the City’s Code 
of Ordinances (the “City Code”) defines and describes the requirements for a “quorum” of City 
Council of the City, the governing body thereof (the “City Council”) and further defines and 
describes the rules of procedure for the meetings of the City Council;  
 
WHEREAS, the City Council recently enacted an emergency ordinance on March 19, 2020 (the 
“Emergency Ordinance”), the provisions of which temporarily suspended certain procedural rules 
of the City Council in response to social-distancing guidelines and executive orders and allowing 
for electronic and telephonic meetings; and 
 
WHEREAS, such telephonic and other electronic meetings have proven successful and effective 
under the Emergency Ordinance and in light of the current public safety considerations associated 
with 2019 novel coronavirus, and the potential for future public safety considerations, including 
those attendant to the adverse weather events that seasonally affect coastal cities, the City Council 
finds that great benefit may be realized from authorizing meeting by telephonic or other electronic 
means whenever necessary and convenient for carrying out the business of the City, to include 
certain boards and commissions associated with the City.

BUDGET
FUNDING
1  Historic Preservation grant has been applied for.  The grant does not require a match from City resources.  Upon notification of award, this project will advance in FY 2021.
Summary of expenditure cuts/additions made since recommended budget presented Tuesday, May 26, 
2020 that impacts all departments. I again want to emphasize that the cuts that have been made will 
require review within 6 months and we may need to make more cuts or add items that have been 
delayed. All will all be reviewed with Council. Items not cut will be explained as to reason why.

They are 5’X8’ heavy duty. This year we replaced 5 US and 6 SC flags. The 
 
 
 
Cost is US = $72/each w/freight and SC = $105/each w/freight. We are a military

old Main Street group with $20‐$25,000 per year. This does not get spent if 
activity is cancelled, like Halloween activities were last year.

As you can see, we went back to all departments and made cuts that we feel can be made and will need 
to be reviewed and possibly adjusted at mid‐year or sooner. Also, our Departments have an excellent 
record of not spending all the budgeted money if it is not needed. We have not had to take money from 
our Fund Balance to cover unbudgeted expenses. Our staff will continue to operate that way.

as that mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed; provided that, in the case of any mutilated Bond, such 
mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and in the case of any lost, stolen or 
destroyed Bond, there shall be first furnished to the City and to the Trustee evidence of or 
affidavit as to such loss, theft or destruction satisfactory to the City and the Trustee together with 
indemnity satisfactory to them. In the event any such Bond shall have matured, instead of issuing 
a duplicate Bond, the City shall pay the same. The City and the Trustee may charge the Holder or 
owner of such Bond with their reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s 
fees, costs and expenses) in connection with such actions.  
 
Section 4.08 
Transfer and Registry; Persons Treated as Owners. 
 
(A) 
As long as any Bonds shall be Outstanding, the City shall cause books for the 
registration and for the transfer of Bonds to be kept. Such books shall be kept by the Trustee 
unless there shall have been appointed a Registrar other than the Trustee to keep the books of 
registration for any particular Series of Bonds, in which case such Registrar shall promptly notify 
the Trustee in writing of any registration or transfer of the Bonds. The transfer of each Bond may 
be registered only upon the registration books of the City kept for that purpose by the registered 
owner thereof in person or by his duly authorized attorney upon surrender thereof and an 
assignment with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee or the Registrar, as 
the case may be, duly executed by the registered owner or his duly authorized attorney. Upon the 
registration or transfer of any Bond, the City shall cause to be issued, subject to the provisions of 
Section 4.11 hereof, in the name of the transferee a new Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate 
principal amount, maturity and interest rate as the surrendered Bond. 
 
(B) 
The City, the Trustee, and any Registrar may deem and treat the person in whose 
name any Bond shall be registered upon the registration books of the City as the absolute owner 
of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be overdue or not, for the purpose of receiving payment 
of, or on account of, the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on such Bond and for all 
other purposes, and all such payments so made to any such registered owner or, upon his order, 
shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of 
the sum or sums so paid; and none of the City, the Trustee and any Registrar shall be affected by 
any notice to the contrary. 
 
(C) 
Notwithstanding anything in paragraphs (A) and (B) of this Section 4.08 to the 
contrary, Bonds may be issued in the form of contractual obligations which are not instruments 
and which may be transferred as provided in such contracts.  
 
Section 4.09 
Date and Payment Provisions. 
 
21 
 
Unless otherwise provided in any Series Ordinance with respect to Bonds issued 
thereunder, each Bond of a Series shall be authenticated on such dates as they shall, in each case, 
be delivered. Each Bond shall bear interest from the Date of Issue if no interest has yet been 
paid; otherwise from the last date to which interest has been paid and which date is on or prior to 
the date of such Bond’s authentication.  
 
 
Holders of at least $1,000,000 principal amount of a Series of Bonds may, by written 
notice containing wiring instructions filed with the Trustee at least 20 days prior to any Bond 
Payment Date, provide for the payment of the interest on such Bonds by wire transfer to an 
account at a bank located in the continental United States.  
 
Section 4.10 
Transferability of Bonds. 
 
 
Bonds of a Series, upon surrender thereof at the office of the Trustee or the Registrar, as 
the case may be, for the Bonds of such Series with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to 
the Trustee or the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder or his duly authorized attorney, may, at 
the option of the Holder and upon payment by such Holder of any charges made pursuant to 
Section 4.11 hereof, be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds of such 
Series of like maturity and interest rate of any other authorized denominations.  
 
Section 4.11 
Regulations With Respect to Exchanges and Transfer. 
 
 
In all cases in which the privilege of exchanging or transferring Bonds is exercised, the 
City shall execute and the Trustee or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall authenticate and 
deliver Bonds in accordance with the provisions of this Bond Ordinance. All Bonds surrendered 
in any such exchanges or transfers shall forthwith be cancelled and destroyed and shall not be 
reissued, and a counterpart of the certificate of destruction evidencing such destruction shall be 
furnished by the Trustee or the Registrar, as the case may be, to the City. All Bonds so destroyed 
shall thereafter no longer be considered Outstanding for any purposes of this Bond Ordinance. 
There shall be no charge to the Holder for such exchange or transfer of Bonds except that the 
Trustee or the Registrar, as the case may be, may make a charge sufficient to reimburse it for any 
tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange or transfer. 
Neither the City nor the Trustee or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall be required to register, 
transfer or exchange Bonds of a Series during the period between a Record Date and its related 
Bond Payment Date, or to register, transfer or exchange any Bonds called for redemption after 
the mailing of any notice of redemption of such Bond. 
 
22 
Section 4.12 
Cancellation and Destruction of Mutilated, Paid or Surrendered Bonds. 
 
 
Upon the surrender of mutilated Bonds pursuant to Section 4.07 hereof, or Bonds paid or 
surrendered, the same shall be cancelled and destroyed and shall not be reissued, and a 
counterpart of the certificate evidencing such destruction shall be furnished by the Trustee or the 
Registrar, as the case may, be, to the City. All Bonds so destroyed shall thereafter no longer be 
considered Outstanding for any purposes of this Bond Ordinance.  
 
Section 4.13 
Notice of Redemption. 
 
 
If any of the Bonds, or portions thereof, are called for redemption, the Trustee, shall give 
written notice to the Holders of any Bonds to be redeemed, in the name of the City, of the 
redemption of such Bonds, or portions thereof. Notice of each redemption of Bonds is required 
to be mailed by the Trustee by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but no more than 60 
days prior to the redemption date to each registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed, at the 
address of such owner recorded on the bond register and to be otherwise given in accordance 
with, among others, the following requirements:  
 
(1) 
notices must contain, at a minimum, the complete official name of the 
Bonds, CUSIP numbers (if any), Bond numbers, principal amount of each Bond to be 
redeemed (if less than all), publication date, redemption date, Redemption Price, 
redemption agent’s name and address and phone number, Trustee’s name and address, 
date of the Bonds, interest rate, maturity date, the place or places where amounts due will 
be payable, and any other descriptive information deemed necessary by the Trustee; 
 
(2) 
notices must be sent to Bondholders of $1,000,000 or more, to the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, if necessary (via its Electronic Municipal 
Market Access (EMMA) system, or its successor, as may be amended or modified), and 
any Securities Depository (if such Bonds are registered in the name of a Securities 
Depository or the nominee of such Securities Depository) by such method or such other 
method as is standard in the industry; in addition, any Bondholder holding in excess of 
$1,000,000 principal amount of Bonds may request the Trustee to send notices to any 
additional addressee specified; 
 
(3) 
a second notice to registered owners of the Bonds must be mailed by the 
means specified above to any registered owner of Bonds who has not presented Bonds for 
redemption 60 days after the redemption date; 
 
(4) 
notice of redemptions effected by advance refundings must also be given 
notice in accordance with the above requirements at least 30 days but no more than sixty 
(60) days prior to the actual redemption date; and 
 
(5) 
CUSIP number identification, if any, with appropriate dollar amounts for 
each CUSIP number must accompany all redemption payments and interest payments, 
whether by check or by wire transfer. 
 
23 
The obligation to provide notice shall not be conditioned upon the prior payment to the 
Paying Agent of money or the delivery to the Paying Agent of Authorized Investments or 
Government Obligations sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds to which such 
notice relates or the interest thereon to the redemption date. 
If at the time of mailing of a notice of redemption, there shall not have been deposited 
with the Trustee or Paying Agent moneys sufficient to redeem all the Bonds or portions thereof 
called for redemption, which moneys are or will be available for redemption of such Bonds, such 
notice is required to state that it is conditional on the deposit of the redemption moneys with the 
Trustee or Paying Agent not later than the opening of business on the redemption date, and such 
notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so deposited. 
 
The failure of the Trustee to give notice to a Bondholder or any defect in such notice 
shall not affect the validity of the redemption of any other Bonds for which notice is properly 
given. Any Bondholder may waive notice of redemption by delivery of a written waiver to the 
Trustee, or delivery of the Bond for payment on the redemption date.  
 
 
Any Series Ordinance providing for the issuance of Bonds consisting of contractual 
obligations not in the form of an instrument or not registered in the name of a Securities 
Depository or the nominee of such Securities Depository or providing for Bonds in bearer form 
may provide alternative methods for delivery of notice of redemption, and the Trustee shall be 
entitled to conclusively rely on such Series Ordinance as being consistent with the provisions of 
this Bond Ordinance.  
 
 
Provided sufficient funds for such redemption are on deposit with the Trustee, all Bonds 
so called for redemption shall cease to bear interest on the specified redemption date and shall no 
longer be deemed to be Outstanding hereunder. If said money shall not be so available on the 
redemption date, such Bonds or portions thereof shall continue to bear interest until paid at the 
same rate as they would have borne had they not been called for redemption.  
 
Section 4.14 
Cancellation of Bonds Which Have Been Redeemed. 
 
 
All Bonds which have been redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee 
and shall not be reissued, and a counterpart of the certificate of destruction evidencing such 
destruction shall be furnished by the Trustee to the City. All Bonds so destroyed shall thereafter 
no longer be considered Outstanding for any purposes of this Bond Ordinance.  
 
Section 4.15 
Restriction on Optional Redemption. 
 
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Bond Ordinance to the contrary, no optional redemption 
of Bonds may occur unless all amounts payable by the City owing under a reimbursement 
agreement with any provider of a surety bond, line of credit, insurance policy or letter of credit 
as contemplated under Section 7.04(D) hereof shall have been paid in full.  
24 
Section 4.16 Selection of Bonds to be Redeemed. 
 
In the event that less than all of the Bonds of any Series are to be redeemed at the option 
of the City, Bonds to be redeemed shall be in such order of maturity as selected by the City. In 
the event of redemption of less than all of the Bonds of a Series of any maturity, the Bonds or 
portions of Bonds to be redeemed, shall be selected by lot by the Trustee. The portion of any 
Bond of a denomination which is larger than the minimum denomination for the Bonds of such 
Series shall be in the principal amount of such minimum denomination or a multiple thereof, and 
that, in selecting portions of such Bonds for redemption, the Trustee shall treat each such Bond 
as representing that number of Bonds of minimum denomination which is obtained by dividing 
the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed in part by the amount of the minimum 
denomination; provided further that, if less than all of the beneficial interests in a Bond of a 
single maturity registered in the name of a Securities Depository or a Securities Depository 
Nominee are to be redeemed, the beneficial interests to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or in 
such manner as may be directed by the Securities Depository. If there shall be drawn for 
redemption less than all of a Bond, the City shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and 
deliver, upon the surrender of such Bond, without charge to the owner thereof, for the 
unredeemed balance of the principal amount of the Bond so surrendered, Bonds of the same 
Series in any authorized denomination. The procedures for selection of Bonds of a Series for 
redemption set forth in this Section 4.16 are subject, however, to any alternative provisions set 
forth in a Series Ordinance applicable to such Series of Bonds. 
 
Section 4.17 
Purchase of Bonds. 
 
 
 
The Trustee shall, if and to the extent practicable, purchase Bonds at the written direction 
of the City at such time, in such manner and at such price as may be specified by the City. The 
Trustee may so purchase Bonds with any money then held by the Trustee which is available for 
the redemption or purchase of Bonds and in excess of that set aside for the payment of Bonds 
called for redemption; provided, that the Trustee is provided with an opinion of Bond Counsel to 
the effect that such redemption or purchase complies with any limitations or restrictions on such 
redemption or purchase contained in this Bond Ordinance.  
 
Section 4.18 
Bonds Issued as Taxable Obligations. 
 
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Bond Ordinance to the contrary, the City may from time 
to time, pursuant to one or more Series Ordinances, provide for the issuance of Bonds the interest 
on which may be includable in gross income of the Holders of such Bonds for federal income 
taxation purposes. 
 
Section 4.19 
Security for Payment of Bonds; Priority of Lien. 
 
 
 
The Bonds, together with the interest thereon, shall be payable solely from and secured 
equally and ratably by a pledge of the Gross Revenues. Such pledge securing the Bonds shall at 
all times and in all respects be and remain superior to pledges made and given to secure any 
other bonds or other obligations payable from the revenues of the System. The Bonds shall not 
constitute an indebtedness of the City within the meaning of any provision, limitation or 
restriction of the Constitution or the laws of the State, other than those provisions authorizing 
25 
indebtedness payable solely from a revenue-producing project not involving revenues from any 
tax or license, and the faith, credit and taxing power of the City are expressly not pledged 
therefor. The City is not obligated to pay any of the Bonds or the interest thereon except from the 
Gross Revenues. 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 6-21-330 of the Enabling Act and as additional 
security for the payment of Bonds, a statutory lien on the System is granted. Such lien shall 
extend to the entirety of the System as currently constituted and as expanded from time to time 
unless otherwise provided in the Series Ordinance authorizing a Series of Bonds for a specific 
improvement to or expansion of the System. Any holder of any of such Bonds may, either at law 
or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce such statutory 
lien and may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, enforce and compel performance 
of all duties of the officials of the City, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the collection of 
Gross Revenues, the proper segregation of the Gross Revenues of the System and the proper 
application thereof. But such statutory lien shall not be construed to give any such Bondholder 
authority to compel the sale of the System or any part thereof. 
 
Section 4.20 
Bonds in Book-Entry Form. 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Bond Ordinance with respect to the form of 
Bonds to the contrary, a Series Ordinance may provide for the issuance of one or more Series of 
Bonds solely in fully registered form registerable to a Securities Depository, a Securities 
Depository Nominee or the beneficial owner of the Bonds. The Series Ordinance may further 
provide that such Series of Bonds shall be evidenced by one or more certificates or by a system 
of book entries in a form satisfactory to the Finance Director and to provide for payment, 
redemption, notices and like provisions in a manner consistent with such system of registration.  
 
Section 4.21 
Waiver of Certain Provisions. 
 
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Bond Ordinance to the contrary, whenever all of the 
debt issued or all of the obligations incurred by the City under a Series Ordinance are acquired 
by and are held by a single entity, that single entity, at its sole option, may waive in writing 
(provided to the City and the Trustee) any provision or requirement of this Bond Ordinance that 
relates separately to the governance of such Series and is for the protection and benefit of such 
single entity only and not for the protection or benefit of any other Holder or Holders of Bonds; 
provided that if such Series of Bonds is insured by an Insurer, then any such waiver shall require 
the prior written approval of such Insurer.  
 
Section 4.22 
Bonds Not in the Form of an Instrument.  
 
 
In the event that the City issues any Series of Bonds which are contractual obligations not 
in the form of an instrument, the provisions regarding redemption or prepayment of such Bonds, 
notices to Bondholders and transfers of such Bonds contained herein may be altered or 
supplemented by the provisions of the Series Ordinance pursuant to which such Bonds are issued 
or the contract pursuant to which such obligations are created.

ARTICLE V 
 
RATES AND CHARGES 
 
Section 5.01 Rate Covenant. 
 
 
(A) 
It is hereby determined that the rates for services and facilities furnished by the 
System shall, until otherwise revised, be as now established. Said rates and charges are 
determined to be sufficient to meet the requirements of this Bond Ordinance but they shall be 
revised by the City Council whenever necessary in order that they shall at all times be 
maintained on a basis sufficient to meet the requirements of this Bond Ordinance. The City 
specifically covenants and agrees to maintain rates and charges for all services furnished by the 
System which shall at all times be sufficient:  
 
(1) 
To provide for the punctual payment of the Principal Installments of and 
interest on all Bonds that may from time to time hereafter by Outstanding, and to that 
end, to maintain the Debt Service Fund and the Debt Service Fund Accounts established 
thereunder and thus provide for the punctual payment of the principal of and interest on 
the Bonds; 
 
(2) 
To maintain the Debt Service Reserve Funds in the manner prescribed 
herein and in any applicable Series Ordinance;  
 
(3) 
To provide for the payment of the Operation and Maintenance Expenses 
as may be necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order;  
 
(4) 
To pay all amounts owing under a reimbursement agreement with any 
provider of a surety bond, insurance policy or letter of credit as contemplated under 
Section 7.04(D) hereof;  
 
(5) 
To provide for the punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all 
Junior Lien Bonds that may from time to time hereafter be outstanding;  
 
(6) 
To build and maintain a reserve for depreciation of the System, for 
contingencies and for improvements, betterments and extensions to the System other than 
those necessary to maintain the same in good repair and working order; and 
 
(7) 
To discharge all obligations imposed by the Enabling Act and by this 
Bond Ordinance and any applicable Series Ordinance. 
 
(B) 
The City covenants and agrees that it will, at all times, prescribe and maintain and 
thereafter collect rates and charges for the services and facilities furnished by the System which, 
together with other income, are reasonably expected to yield annual Net Earnings in the current 
Fiscal Year equal to at least the sum of 120% of the Annual Principal and Interest Requirement 
in such Fiscal Year for all Bonds Outstanding. Promptly upon any material change in the 
circumstances which were contemplated at the time such rates and charges were most recently 
27 
reviewed, but not less frequently than once in each Fiscal Year, the City, with or without the aid 
of an Independent Consultant, shall review the rates and charges for its services and shall 
promptly revise such rates and charges as necessary to comply with the foregoing requirement. 
Prior to the beginning of each Fiscal Year, the City shall adopt an Annual Budget including 
amended rate schedules for such Fiscal Year which shall set forth in reasonable detail the 
estimated revenues and operating expenses and other expenditures of the System for such Fiscal 
Year which shall include the amount to be deposited during such Fiscal Year in the Depreciation 
Fund and Contingent Fund. The City may at any time adopt an amended Annual Budget for the 
remainder of the then current Fiscal Year.  
 
(C) 
If the City, in adopting the Annual Budget, determines that revenues may not be 
sufficient to meet the rate covenant established hereinabove or if the audited financial statements 
of the City indicate that the City did not satisfy the rate covenant for the prior year, the City 
shall, within 45 days of such determination or indication, engage an Independent Consultant to 
prepare a report recommending such actions which will provide sufficient revenues in the 
following Fiscal Year to permit the City to meet the rate covenant. The Trustee shall be promptly 
notified of the engagement of the Independent Consultant. Copies of such report shall be made 
available to the City and the Trustee no later than 60 days after the engagement of the 
Independent Consultant.  
 
The City agrees that it shall use its best efforts to effect such changes recommended by 
the Independent Consultant in its report. So long as the City uses its best efforts to comply with 
such recommendations, failure to comply with the rate covenant shall not constitute an Event of 
Default under Article XIII hereof; provided however, a failure to comply with the rate covenant 
for a period of two consecutive Fiscal Years following the date of receipt of the Independent 
Consultant’s report shall constitute an Event of Default. The Trustee has no duty or obligation to 
monitor the City’s compliance with any recommendations of the Independent Consultants and 
shall be entitled to rely on a certification of the City that it is using its best efforts to comply with 
any such recommendations.

ARTICLE VI 
 
JUNIOR LIEN BONDS AND SPECIAL FACILITIES BONDS 
 
Section 6.01 
Right to Issue Junior Lien Bonds; Accession Thereof to Status of Bonds. 
 
 
(A) 
Notwithstanding that Bonds may be Outstanding, the City may at any time, and 
without limitation and free of all conditions issue Junior Lien Bonds, in such amount as it may 
from time to time determine, payable from the revenues of the System, provided that the pledge 
of revenues of the System granted for the protection of said Junior Lien Bonds, shall at all times 
be and remain subordinate and inferior in all respects to the pledges of revenues made or 
authorized for the Bonds and to the payment of all Operation and Maintenance Expenses; and 
provided, further, that the maturity of Junior Lien Bonds may not be accelerated and paid in full 
unless all of the Bonds shall have been paid or provision therefor has been made pursuant to 
Article XVI hereof.  
 
 
(B) 
By proceedings authorizing the issuance of Junior Lien Bonds, the City may 
provide for the accession of such Junior Lien Bonds to the status of Bonds provided all of the 
following conditions are met. Any such subsequent proceedings adopted by the City Council 
providing for such accession shall make the findings provided in subparagraphs (l) through (4) 
and state whether and to what extent a Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be established as set 
forth in subparagraph (5).  
 
(1) 
The Junior Lien Bonds were issued for a purpose or purposes set forth in 
Section 4.01(A) hereof.  
 
(2) 
There shall exist on the date of accession (a) no default in the payment of 
the principal of or interest on any Bonds or any Junior Lien Bonds then Outstanding, (b) 
no default in the performance of any duties required under the provisions of this Bond 
Ordinance, and (c) no amount owed by the City with respect to the full funding of a Debt 
Service Reserve Fund, either by way of cash or reimbursement of any other funding 
mechanism, except in accordance with Section 4.02(5)(a) hereof.  
 
(3) 
There shall be deposited in the Debt Service Fund Account for such Series 
of newly-acceded Bonds the amounts which would have been required under the 
provisions of Section 8.02 hereof to be accumulated therein on the date of accession if 
said Junior Lien Bonds had originally been issued as Bonds.  
 
(4) 
On the date of accession, the earnings tests prescribed by Section 4.02(6) 
hereof shall have been met.  
 
(5) 
In the event such proceedings require a Reserve Requirement to be 
maintained for such Series of newly-acceded Bonds, then in such event, there shall be on 
deposit on the date of accession in a Debt Service Reserve Fund an amount equal to the 
Reserve Requirement established for such Junior Lien Bonds which are being acceded to 
the status of Bonds.  
29 
 
(6) 
The City shall obtain an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that: (a) 
this Bond Ordinance and the proceedings authorizing such Junior Lien Bonds have been 
duly adopted and are in full force and effect; (b) the Junior Lien Bonds have been duly 
and lawfully authorized and executed by the City and are valid and binding upon, and 
enforceable against, the City (except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be 
limited by the operation of bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting rights and 
remedies of creditors); and (c) this Bond Ordinance creates the valid pledge which it 
purports to create of the revenues and of moneys and securities on deposit in any of the 
funds established hereunder subject to the application thereof to the purposes and on the 
conditions permitted by this Bond Ordinance.  
 
(7) 
In the event such Junior Lien Bonds were issued with variable rates, the 
provisions of subparagraph (8) of Section 4.02 shall have been met.  
 
Section 6.02 
Right to Issue Special Facilities Bonds. 
 
 
(A) 
The City shall have at all times the right to enter into contracts, leases or other 
agreements pursuant to which it will agree to construct, operate and pay the costs of Special 
Facilities to be financed by its issuance of Special Facilities Bonds, subject to the following 
conditions:  
 
(1) 
It shall have been determined to the satisfaction of the City that the rents, 
revenues or receipts to be derived from the Special Facilities shall be at least equal to the 
principal, interest and any reserve requirements contained in the ordinance authorizing 
such Special Facilities Bonds and to pay all operation, maintenance and other costs and 
expenses applicable to such Special Facilities;  
 
(2) 
The revenues derived from Special Facilities need not be deposited in the 
Stormwater Fund, and may be pledged to secure Special Facilities Bonds; but no debt 
service or other costs or expense related to any Special Facilities may be paid from 
System revenues deposited in the Stormwater Fund except pursuant to Section 8.08 
hereof; and  
 
(3) 
The City Council shall have determined that the issuance of the Special 
Facilities Bonds and the application of revenues from the Special Facilities to the 
payment thereof shall not have a detrimental effect on the System or the Bondholders. 
 
(B) 
For purposes of this Section 6.02, the term “Special Facilities” shall include all or 
a portion of the Facilities (or those enterprises, if any referred to in Section 11.02 hereof) and 
rights to all or a portion of the use of, or the capacity available from, any such Facilities.  
 
Section 6.03  Lease Financing Agreements. 
 
The City shall have at all times the right to enter into capital leases or other lease 
financing agreements secured by a lien on the property, plant and equipment comprising a part 
30 
of the System, which may or may not be limited to the property, plant or equipment acquired or 
improved by such capital lease or other lease financing arrangement; provided, however, that: 
(1) the aggregate principal amount of such capital lease or other lease financing arrangement 
outstanding at any time shall not exceed 10% of the value of the property, plant and equipment 
of the System, less accumulated depreciation, as shown on the audited balance sheet of the City 
for the most recent Fiscal Year for which audited financial statements are available; and (2) the 
loss of the property secured by the lien related to the capital lease or lease financing 
arrangement will not materially adversely affect the ability of the City to meet its financial 
obligations under this Bond Ordinance.

ARTICLE VII 
 
ESTABLISHMENT OF FUNDS 
 
Section 7.01 
Requirement for Special Funds. 
 
 
For so long a time as any sum remains due and payable by way of principal or interest on 
Bonds, the following funds or accounts relating to the Gross Revenues of the System shall be 
established and maintained, and deposits shall be made therein in the manner herein required.  
 
Section 7.02 
The Stormwater Fund. 
 
 
(A) 
There shall be established and maintained a special fund or account designated as 
the “Stormwater Fund” held and administered by the City within the City’s general fund. This 
account shall be so maintained as to accurately reflect:  
 
(1) 
the Gross Revenues of the System; and  
 
(2) 
Net Earnings.  
 
 
(B) 
Except as otherwise specifically directed or permitted herein, all Gross Revenues 
of the System shall be deposited or credited in accordance with and in the manner prescribed by 
Article VIII hereof into this fund. Money in the Stormwater Fund shall be withdrawn and made 
use of only in the manner and in the order of priority specified in Article VIII hereof. So long as 
the City establishes, under Accounting Principles, proper records of receipts and disbursements 
from the Stormwater Fund, the Stormwater Fund may be used for the purposes of the Operation 
and Maintenance Fund, the Depreciation Fund, and Contingent Fund, subject to the prior 
applications of the amounts in the Stormwater Fund for the purposes set forth in Sections 7.03 
and 7.04 hereof.  
 
 
(C) 
Upon a determination by City Council, acting by Ordinance, that no Bondholders 
shall be materially affected or any security for any Outstanding Bonds being diminished in any 
way, the Stormwater Fund associated therewith may be transferred from the general fund and 
established as a standalone enterprise fund of the City under Accounting Principles. 
 
Section 7.03 
The Debt Service Fund. 
 
(A) 
There shall be established and maintained a Debt Service Fund held by the 
Trustee. Within the Debt Service Fund, there shall be established a Debt Service Fund Account 
for each Series of Bonds Outstanding. Each Debt Service Fund Account is intended to provide 
for the ratable payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on the 
respective Series of Bonds as the same respectively fall due. Payments into the Debt Service 
Fund shall be made in the manner prescribed by this Bond Ordinance, including the applicable 
provisions of Article VIII hereof, and, except as herein provided, all money in the respective 
Debt Service Fund Accounts shall be used solely to pay the principal of, redemption premium, if 
any, and interest on the respective Series of Bonds, and for no other purpose. Each Debt Service 
32 
Fund Account shall bear a numeric or alphanumeric Series designation as may be necessary to 
distinguish each Debt Service Fund Account from all others. 
 
(B) 
The Debt Service Fund and each Debt Service Fund Account thereunder shall be 
kept in the complete custody and control of the Trustee and withdrawals from each Debt Service 
Fund Account shall be made only by such Trustee who shall transmit to each Bondholder, at 
such times as may be appropriate, the sums required to pay the principal of, redemption 
premium, if any, and interest on the respective Series of Bonds. Amounts held by the Trustee due 
to non-presentment of Bonds on any redemption date must be retained by the Trustee for a 
period of at least one year after the final maturity of such Bonds. After such one-year period, 
funds retained in the Debt Service Account for more than one year shall be remitted to the Office 
of the State Treasurer as unclaimed property. Further, subject to the written consent of the City, 
payment on a Series of Bonds may be made without presentation and surrender of the physical 
Bond; in such event, the Trustee assumes no liability to any person and no obligation shall be 
imposed on the Trustee to seek the return of such Series of Bonds from the Holder thereof.  
 
(C) 
Moneys in the Debt Service Fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Trustee 
at the written direction of an Authorized Officer or his designee in Authorized Investments, 
maturing not later than the date on which such money is required to pay the principal of, 
premium, if any, and interest on the next occurring maturity of the Bonds. The Trustee shall have 
no responsibility for the investment of money in the Debt Service Fund that is not held by the 
Trustee. Unless otherwise provided in a Series Ordinance, all earnings from such investments 
shall be added to and become a part of the Debt Service Fund Account in which such 
investments are held, but shall be credited against payments that would otherwise be made to 
such Debt Service Fund Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.02 hereof.  
 
(D) 
All monies received by the Trustee as Interest Payment Subsidies shall be 
deposited in the Debt Service Fund Account for such Series of Bonds and used to pay debt 
service on the Series of Bonds with respect to which such Interest Payment Subsidy was 
received. 
 
(E) 
There may be established in the applicable Debt Service Fund Accounts from 
time to time a capitalized interest account to provide for the payment of interest on the Bonds of 
a particular Series. Any such account shall be created by the Series Ordinance relating to the 
issuance of such Series of Bonds. Any earnings from the investment of funds in the capitalized 
interest account not required to pay interest on the Bonds of any Series during the period for 
which interest on the Bonds of such Series is capitalized shall be deposited in the Project Fund 
created by the Series Ordinance relating to such Bonds or, if such Project Fund has been 
terminated or no such fund was created, such earnings shall be retained in the appropriate Debt 
Service Fund Account. 
 
(F) 
Within each Debt Service Fund Account, the Trustee, or as otherwise provided in 
the Series Ordinance, is authorized to create sub-accounts, as it determines necessary for the 
timely payment of the principal of, interest on, and sinking fund installments due on the Bonds.  
 
33 
Section 7.04 
The Debt Service Reserve Funds. 
 
(A) 
Each Series Ordinance may create a Debt Service Reserve Fund for the Series of 
Bonds authorized thereby. Any such Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be for the equal and 
ratable benefit only of Bonds of that Series. Each such Debt Service Reserve Fund is intended to 
insure the timely payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, that Series of 
Bonds, and to provide for the redemption of such Bonds prior to their stated maturities. Any 
Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be maintained in an amount equal to the Reserve Requirement 
for such Series of Bonds. Unless otherwise provided in a Series Ordinance, money in a Debt 
Service Reserve Fund shall be used for the following purposes, and for no other:  
 
(1) 
To prevent a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the 
applicable Series of Bonds, by reason of the fact that money in its Debt Service Fund 
Account is insufficient for such purposes;  
 
(2) 
To pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds of that Series in the event that 
all Outstanding Bonds of such Series be redeemed as a whole; or  
 
(3) 
To effect partial redemption of the applicable Series of Bonds; but subject 
to the restrictions of Section 4.15 hereof and provided that subsequent to said partial 
redemption, the market value of the cash and securities in the Debt Service Reserve Fund 
shall be not less than the Reserve Requirement therefor.  
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.04(A)(1-3) above and as permitted by the 
Code and Section 4.21 hereof, if the Debt Service Reserve Fund was funded with cash generated 
by the System, then, upon the written consent of the Holder of such Series of Bonds secured by 
such Debt Service Reserve Fund, the monies in such Debt Service Reserve Fund may be returned 
to the City prior to the final maturity of such Series. The requirements for and provisions 
governing any Debt Service Reserve Fund in the remainder of this Bond Ordinance shall, in 
references to “the Debt Service Reserve Fund,” “the Reserve Requirement” and “the Bonds,” be 
deemed to refer to each such Debt Service Reserve Fund created by a Series Ordinance, if any, 
and in each case to the respective Reserve Requirement for the respective Series of Bonds, and to 
Bonds only of that respective Series and not to any other Bonds.  
  
(B) 
(1) 
Except as provided in (B)(2) below, each Debt Service Reserve Fund shall 
be kept in the complete custody and control of the Trustee and withdrawals therefrom 
shall be made only by the Trustee who shall transmit to the Bondholders, at such times as 
may be appropriate, the sums required to pay the principal of, redemption premium, if 
any, and interest on the Bonds.  
 
 
 
(2) 
If a Series of Bonds is held by the Water Quality Authority, then the Debt 
Service Reserve Fund for such Series of Bonds may be kept in the custody and control of 
the Office of State Treasurer and invested in Authorized Investments. Withdrawals 
therefrom shall be made only as directed by the Water Quality Authority at such times as 
may be required to pay the principal and interest on such Series of Bonds. Any 
withdrawal of the monies in a Debt Service Reserve Fund that exceeds the Reserve 
34 
Requirement shall be transferred in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.04(C) 
hereof.  
 
(C)   
Except as provided in Section 7.04(B)(2) herein, money in a Debt Service 
Reserve Fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Trustee at the written direction of an 
Authorized Officer or his designee in Authorized Investments. Subject to the remaining 
provisions of this paragraph (C), the earnings from such investments shall be added to and 
become a part of that Debt Service Reserve Fund. Except as provided in a Series Ordinance, if as 
of any date of calculation, the value of the securities and money in a Debt Service Reserve Fund 
shall exceed its Reserve Requirement, such excess shall, at the written direction of the City, 
either be used to effect partial redemption of Bonds of that Series, or shall be removed from such 
Debt Service Reserve Fund and, either (i) transferred into the applicable Debt Service Fund 
Account, or (ii) transferred to the Stormwater Fund, as permitted by the provisions of the Code.  
 
(D)   
In the event a Series Ordinance requires a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be 
established for a Series of Bonds, unless otherwise required by such Series Ordinance, the City, 
in lieu of the deposit of moneys into a Debt Service Reserve Fund, may alternatively satisfy the 
applicable Reserve Requirement by causing to be so credited to such Debt Service Reserve Fund 
an irrevocable and unconditional surety bond, line of credit, letter of credit or insurance policy 
equal to the Reserve Requirement therefor.  
 
(E)  
In the event the amount credited to a Debt Service Reserve Fund under a surety 
bond, letter of credit, or insurance policy (the “Original Funding Instrument”) also includes 
amounts available under another surety bond, letter of credit, or insurance policy (the 
“Additional Funding Instrument”), draws on the Original Funding Instrument and the 
Additional Funding Instrument shall be made on a pro rata basis to fund any insufficiency in the 
Debt Service Fund Account. In the event a Debt Service Reserve Fund is funded with both 
monies and a surety bond, letter of credit, or insurance policy (1) any withdrawals from such 
Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be made first from such monies (or the liquidation of 
investments made therewith) and second from such surety bond, line of credit, letter of credit, or 
insurance policy, and (2) cash deposits to such Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be used first to 
restore the cash balance and second to reinstate the surety bond, line of credit, letter of credit, or 
insurance policy. The surety bond, line of credit, letter of credit, or insurance policy shall be 
payable (upon the giving of notice as required thereunder) on any Bond Payment Date on which 
moneys will be required to be withdrawn from such Debt Service Reserve Fund and applied to 
the payment of the principal of or interest on the Outstanding Series of Bonds to which such 
surety bond, line of credit, letter of credit, or insurance policy relates when such payments cannot 
be made by amounts otherwise credited to such Debt Service Reserve Fund.  
 
Section 7.05 
The Operation and Maintenance Fund. 
 
(A) 
There shall be established and maintained an Operation and Maintenance Fund 
held and administered by the City. The Operation and Maintenance Fund is intended to provide 
for the payment of the Operation and Maintenance Expenses.  
 
35 
(B) 
Withdrawals from the Operation and Maintenance Fund shall be made by or on 
the order of an Authorized Officer in accordance, as nearly as may be practicable, with the 
Annual Budget then in effect. 
 
Section 7.06 
The Depreciation Fund. 
 
(A) 
There shall be established and maintained a Depreciation Fund held and 
administered by the City. This fund shall be maintained in an amount to be established not less 
frequently than annually by the City Council in order to provide a reasonable reserve for 
depreciation of the System.   
 
(B) 
Money in this fund shall be used solely:  
 
(1) 
For the purpose of restoring depreciated or obsolete items of the System; 
 
(2)   
To prevent defaults of Bonds and Junior Lien Bonds; and 
 
(3)   
For optional redemption of Bonds or Junior Lien Bonds. 
 
(C) 
Withdrawals from this fund shall be made by or on order of the City.  
 
Section 7.07 
The Contingent Fund. 
 
(A) 
There shall be established and maintained a Contingent Fund held and 
administered by the City. This fund shall be maintained in an amount to be established not less 
frequently than annually by the City Council in order to provide a reasonable reserve for 
contingencies and for improvements, betterments and extensions of the System.   
 
 
(B) 
Money in this fund shall be used solely: 
 
(1) 
For improvements, betterments and extensions to the System, other than 
for those things which are reasonably necessary to maintain the System in 
good repair and working order; 
 
(2) 
To defray the cost of unforeseen contingencies and extraordinary repairs 
to the System; 
 
(3) 
To prevent defaults of Bonds and Junior Lien Bonds; and 
 
(4) 
For optional redemption of Bonds or Junior Lien Bonds. 
 
(C) 
Withdrawals from this fund shall be made by or on order of an Authorized 
Officer. 
 
36 
Section 7.08 
The Rate Stabilization Fund. 
 
 
The City Council may establish a Rate Stabilization Fund, as needed, and, if created, 
shall administer such fund under the provisions of this Bond Ordinance and State law. 
 
Section 7.09 
Establishment of Project Funds.  
 
 
With respect to each Series of Bonds issued for the purposes set forth at Section 
4.01(A)(1) hereof, there shall be established a Project Fund pursuant to the respective Series 
Ordinance to be held by the Trustee, unless otherwise provided in such Series Ordinance. The 
moneys in the respective Project Fund shall be used to defray the costs of and to pay any costs 
incurred or to be incurred with respect to the project so financed and costs of issuance incurred in 
connection therewith. The City may, but shall not be required to establish a capitalized interest 
account and a cost of issuance account in any Project Fund so created. On the occasion of the 
delivery of any such Series of Bonds, the proceeds therefrom shall be paid into the Project Fund 
established for such Series as set forth in the Series Ordinance authorizing their issue. 
Withdrawals from a Project Fund and the accounts, if any, therein shall not be made except as 
provided in the Series Ordinance establishing such Project Fund. 
 
Section 7.10 
Investments of Funds. 
 
 
Whenever, in the opinion of the City, it becomes desirable to invest money in any of the 
funds established by this Article (other than the Debt Service Reserve Funds, the Debt Service 
Fund, and any capitalized interest account) the City may make Authorized Investments. Earnings 
resulting from the investment of money in a particular fund shall be deposited into the 
Stormwater Fund (i) except as otherwise provided in Sections 7.03 and 7.04 hereof, and (ii) 
unless the City Council shall have determined pursuant to the Annual Budget that any such 
earnings on amounts in the Depreciation Fund and Contingent Fund shall remain therein. 
 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and as limited solely to the 
funds held and invested by the Trustee, the Trustee shall have no obligation to enter into any 
repurchase agreement, investment agreement or any similar agreements with respect to the 
investment of any monies held under this Bond Ordinance unless (i) such agreement is in form 
and content acceptable to the Trustee in its sole discretion, (ii) any liability of the Trustee under 
such agreement is limited to loss occasioned by the negligence or willful misconduct of the 
Trustee, and (iii) the City shall pay to the Trustee an additional fee established by the Trustee in 
accordance with its customary practices.

ARTICLE VIII 
 
DISPOSITION OF REVENUES 
 
Section 8.01 
Deposits to Stormwater Fund; Dispositions Therefrom. 
 
 
The Gross Revenues of the System are declared to be a part of the Stormwater Fund and 
shall from time to time be promptly deposited in a bank or depository in an account which will 
reflect the fact that they are a part of the Stormwater Fund. If Bonds are Outstanding, the 
dispositions from the Stormwater Fund required by the remaining Sections of this Article shall 
be made on or before the last Business Day of each month following the delivery of the first 
Series of Bonds issued hereunder. Payments from the Stormwater Fund shall be made in the 
order of priority established by the sequence of the remaining Sections of this Article.  
 
Section 8.02 
Payments for Bonds. 
 
 
Provision shall be made for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on 
all Bonds then Outstanding without priority of any other Bonds but ratably as to each Series of 
Bonds. To that end:  
 
(1) 
There shall be deposited into the Debt Service Fund and thereafter 
transferred into the respective Debt Service Fund Account (and thereafter to the 
respective interest sub-account, if any) the monthly fraction of the aggregate amount of 
interest to become due on the respective Series of Bonds on the next ensuing Bond 
Payment Date; provided, however, that if provision has been made for the payment of all 
or part of the next installment of interest to become due on any Bonds, or the Trustee is in 
receipt of any Interest Payment Subsidies, pursuant to any other provision of this Bond 
Ordinance, or any Series Ordinance, or by reason of investment earnings or otherwise, 
then, in such event, the deposits required by this paragraph may be omitted, or reduced 
accordingly.  
 
(2) 
There shall be deposited into the Debt Service Fund and thereafter 
transferred into the respective Debt Service Fund Account (and thereafter to the 
respective principal sub-account, if any) the monthly fraction of the Principal Installment 
of the respective Series of Bonds next becoming due and payable (whether at stated 
maturity or by sinking fund installments), so that on each principal maturity date, the 
amount of principal to be paid shall have been accumulated and be on hand; provided, 
however, that if provision has been made for the payment of all or part of the next 
installment of principal to become due on the respective Series of Bonds, pursuant to any 
other provision of this Bond Ordinance, or any Series Ordinance, or by reason of 
investment earnings or otherwise, then, in such event, the deposits required by this 
paragraph may be omitted, or reduced accordingly.  
 
(3) 
If, on the occasion when the deposits required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of 
this Section, are to be made, the sum total of the deposits required thereby plus previous 
monthly deposits and the remaining deposits to be made prior to the next succeeding 
38 
principal and interest payment dates, will be less than the sum required to effect the 
payment of the next succeeding installment of either principal or interest, or both on the 
respective Series of Bonds, as the case may be, a sum equal to such deficiency shall be 
added to the deposits so to be made.  
 
Section 8.03 
Deposits for the Debt Service Reserve Funds—Valuation. 
 
 
Deposits shall next be made in the amounts required by this Section 8.03 or Section 
4.02(5) into the respective Debt Service Reserve Funds. Except as provided in Section 
7.04(B)(2), the Trustee shall calculate the value of the cash and securities in each Debt Service 
Reserve Fund 45 days prior to each Bond Payment Date in order to determine if each Debt 
Service Reserve Fund contains the Reserve Requirement therefor, and the extent to which 
payments therefor or withdrawals must be made therefrom, and the timing thereof, pursuant to 
this Bond Ordinance and the respective Series Ordinances. To the extent the Trustee determines 
that a deficiency exists, but such deficiency is solely the result of accounting practices governing 
the valuation of securities in the Debt Service Reserve Fund, the Trustee may alternatively 
calculate the value of the securities in each Debt Service Reserve Fund as of the maturity date of 
such securities, so long as such securities mature on or prior to the Bond Payment Date. Unless a 
Debt Service Reserve Fund is being funded pursuant to Section 4.02(5)(a) of this Bond 
Ordinance or otherwise contains cash and securities (or a surety bond, insurance policy, or letter 
of credit as herein described) in an amount at least equal to its Reserve Requirement, unless 
otherwise provided in the Series Ordinance, there shall be paid into such Debt Service Reserve 
Fund on the last Business Day of each of the 24 months following a determination of a 
deficiency in such Debt Service Reserve Fund one-twenty-fourth (1/24) of the amount necessary 
to re-establish in such Debt Service Reserve Fund its Reserve Requirement; provided, however, 
nothing herein shall preclude the City from fully re-establishing such Reserve Requirement in a 
more timely fashion than as so prescribed. Any surety bond, line of credit, insurance policy or 
letter of credit being used to meet the Reserve Requirement of a Debt Service Reserve Fund shall 
be valued at the amount still remaining to be drawn thereon; and in the event that any such surety 
bond, line of credit, insurance policy or letter of credit has been drawn upon, the amount 
necessary to restore the principal balance thereof shall be paid by the City in the same manner 
and on a parity with the payments described in this Section 8.03 or as provided in an insurance 
agreement or applicable Series Ordinance.  
 
The market value of any Authorized Investments in a Debt Service Reserve Fund shall be 
calculated as follows:  
 
(1) 
as to investments the bid and asked prices of which are published on a 
regular basis in The Wall Street Journal (or, if published therein, then in The New York 
Times): the average of the bid and asked prices for such investments so published on or 
most recently prior to such time of determination; 
 
(2) 
as to investments the bid and asked prices of which are not published on a 
regular basis in The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times: the average bid price at 
such time of determination for such investments by any two nationally recognized 
government securities dealers (selected by the Trustee in its absolute discretion) at the 
39 
time making a market in such investments or the bid price published by a nationally 
recognized pricing service;  
 
(3) 
as to certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances: the face amount 
thereof, plus accrued interest; and  
 
(4) 
as to any investment not specified above, the value thereof established by 
prior agreement between the City and the Trustee.  
 
Section 8.04 
Deposits to the Operation and Maintenance Fund. 
 
 
There shall be deposited in the Operation and Maintenance Fund, either from the 
Stormwater Fund or the Rate Stabilization Fund, the amounts budgeted for Operation and 
Maintenance Expenses for the ensuing month and any amounts required for an operational 
reserve.  
 
Section 8.05 
Reimbursement of Interest on Amounts Advanced by Credit Providers for the 
Debt Service Reserve Fund. 
 
 
Provision shall then be made for payment of interest and any fees or penalties on amounts 
advanced by the provider of any surety bond, line of credit, letter of credit or insurance policy as 
contemplated in Section 7.04(D) hereof.  
 
Section 8.06 
Payments for Junior Lien Bonds. 
 
 
Provision shall then be made for the payment of any other indebtedness which is junior 
and subordinate to the Bonds in the order of priority contemplated by the proceedings 
authorizing their issuance.  
 
Section 8.07 
Deposits for the Depreciation Fund and Contingent Fund. 
 
 
A. 
There shall be deposited into the Depreciation Fund that sum which is one-twelfth 
(1/12) of the sum which has been currently determined by the City Council to be the budgeted 
requirement therefor for the then current Fiscal Year.  
 
 
B. 
There shall be deposited into the Contingent Fund that sum which is one-twelfth 
(1/12) of the sum which has been currently determined by the City Council to be the budgeted 
requirement therefor for the then current Fiscal Year. 
 
Section 8.08 
Use of Surplus Money. 
 
 
All money remaining after making the payments required by Sections 8.01 to 8.07, shall 
be disposed of for any lawful purpose in such manner as the City Council shall from time to time 
determine.  
 
40 
 
The City may determine, at any time, to deposit any percentage or any set amount of 
surplus money under this Section 8.08 into the Rate Stabilization Fund.  Amounts on deposit in 
the Rate Stabilization Fund may, at the direction of an Authorized Officer, be used to make 
deposits into the Operation and Maintenance Fund required by Section 8.04 hereof.  Amounts on 
deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund may, at the option of the City Council, be withdrawn and 
used for any other required purpose of the System, but in such event, such withdrawal, if for a 
purpose other than the payments of Operation and Maintenance Expenses, shall be excluded 
from Net Earnings.

ARTICLE IX 
 
AGREEMENT TO FURNISH  
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO SYSTEM 
 
Section 9.01 
Keeping Records. 
 
 
The City recognizes that those who may from time to time hereafter be Bondholders will, 
throughout the life of the Bonds, require full information with respect to the System, the fiscal 
affairs of the System, and all matters incident to each. To that end, the City hereby covenants and 
agrees that it will install and thereafter at all times maintain proper books of records and 
accounts, separate and distinct from all other records and accounts, in which complete and 
correct entries shall be made of all transactions relating to the System, and all revenues and 
receipts derived therefrom, directly or indirectly. Such books and records shall be kept in such 
fashion as to reveal in detail:  
 
(A) 
 
The Gross Revenues of the System and the source from whence derived; 
 
(B) 
All Operation and Maintenance Expenses; 
 
(C) 
The Net Earnings of the System and a schedule demonstrating compliance with 
Section 5.01(B) hereof for such Fiscal Year; 
 
(D) 
All expenditures made from the several funds established by this Bond Ordinance, 
and Series Ordinances authorizing the issuance of the Bonds; and 
 
(E) 
The rate schedules that may from time to time be in force.  
 
Section 9.02 
Audit Required. 
 
 
The City further covenants and agrees that so long as any Bonds are Outstanding, it will, 
not later than seven months after the close of each Fiscal Year, cause to be made and completed 
by the Auditors, an audit of the records, books and accounts pertaining to the System, made in 
accordance with Accounting Principles, showing, among other things, Gross Revenues and Net 
Earnings; and that it will furnish a copy of such audit to the Trustee. Such audit shall comment 
upon any violation of any provision of any resolution authorizing the issuance of any Bonds or 
Junior Lien Bonds and any violation of any provision of this Bond Ordinance noted by the 
Auditors, and such other matters as to them seem pertinent. The cost of such audit shall be 
treated as an Operation and Maintenance Expense. Any audits made available to the City shall 
not otherwise be restricted as to their subsequent dissemination to any party. 
 
 
Pursuant to the Enabling Act, the City will make available, upon request, for inspection 
during regular business hours an unaudited balance sheet and income statement and other 
information required thereby within six months of the close of the Fiscal Year. 
 
[End of Article IX] 
 
42 
ARTICLE X 
 
INSURANCE 
 
Section 10.01 
Requirement of Insurance. 
 
 
(A) 
The City covenants and agrees that so long as any Bonds are Outstanding: 
 
(1) 
To the extent insurance coverage is available, that it will insure and at all 
times keep the System insured against physical loss or damage with a responsible insurance 
company or companies, authorized and qualified under the laws of the State, to assume the risks 
insured against, in such amount as private corporations engaged in similar endeavors would 
customarily insure for; 
 
(2) 
That it will secure adequate fidelity bonds (blanket or individual) of a 
surety company doing business in the State, indemnifying the City against defalcation of all 
persons handling money derived from the System or signing checks on any bank accounts 
relating to the System, other than the Trustee or any Registrar; 
 
(3) 
That all premiums on all bonds or insurance policies shall be deemed an 
Operation and Maintenance Expense and paid out of Gross Revenues of the System; 
 
(4) 
That all insurance policies shall be open to the inspection of any 
Bondholder at any reasonable time; 
 
(5) 
That all money received by the City as a consequence of any defalcation, 
covered by any fidelity bond, shall be used to restore the fund depleted by the defalcation. All 
sums received by the City from insurance policies covering the System may, to the extent 
necessary, be applied to the repair and replacement of the damaged or destroyed property, but, in 
the event that such money is not used for such purposes, then the same shall be deposited in the 
Depreciation Fund or Contingent Fund; and 
 
(6) 
That it will comply with the requirements of State law regarding the 
mandatory purchase of liability insurance contained in Section 15-78-140(b) of the South 
Carolina Code.   
 
(B) 
Insurance required by this Section 10.01 may be provided through the South 
Carolina Insurance Reserve Fund. The City may obtain or adopt alternative risk management 
programs which an Insurance Consultant determines to be reasonable, including, without 
limitation, self-insurance in whole or in part individually or in connection with other institutions, 
participation in programs of captive insurance companies; participation with other governmental 
entities in mutual or other cooperative insurance or other risk management programs, 
participation in state or federal insurance programs, taking advantage of state or federal laws 
now or hereafter in existence limiting liability, or establishing or participating in other alternative 
risk management programs; all as may be approved by the Insurance Consultant as reasonable 
and appropriate risk management by the City. If the City shall be self-insured for any coverage, 
43 
the City shall obtain a report of an Insurance Consultant stating whether the anticipated funding 
of any self-insurance fund is actuarially sound, and if not, the required funding to produce such 
result and such coverage shall be reviewed by the Insurance Consultant not less frequently than 
annually. Any self-insurance program shall be subject to annual review by the Insurance 
Consultant who shall provide a written report to the City which shall include recommendations 
relating to such self-insurance program. The City shall provide to the Trustee annual certification 
evidencing compliance with the Insurance Consultant’s recommendations. The Trustee has no 
duty or obligation to make any determination as to the sufficiency of the insurance required to be 
maintained hereunder.

ARTICLE XI 
 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS 
 
Section 11.01 
Additional Covenants to Secure Bonds. 
 
The City further covenants and agrees:  
 
(A) 
That neither the System, nor any part thereof, nor any of the revenues derived 
from the System, have been or will be hypothecated, mortgaged, otherwise pledged or 
encumbered, save and except in accordance with the provisions hereof; 
 
(B) 
That it will permit no free service to be rendered, or use to be made of the services 
and facilities of the System, and for the services and facilities of the System used by the City, the 
reasonable cost and value of such services and facilities shall be paid as such services accrue. 
The revenue so received from the City shall be deemed revenue derived from the operation of the 
System, and shall be accounted for in the same manner as other revenues of the System; 
 
(C) 
That it will do all things necessary to maintain and enforce the provisions of the 
IGA and the levy and collection of Stormwater Utility User Fees thereunder; however, nothing 
shall prohibit the amendment, revision, adjustment or cancellation of the IGA so long as the City 
maintains the ability to levy and collect Stormwater Utility User Fees in an amount necessary to 
meet the coverage requirements in Section 5.01(B) herein. 
 
(D) 
That so long as there are any Bonds Outstanding and unpaid, it will perform all 
duties with reference to the System required by the Constitution of the State and the South 
Carolina Code; 
 
(E) 
That it will not pledge, mortgage, or otherwise encumber the System or any 
portion thereof, or any revenues therefrom except in the manner herein authorized, and (except 
as provided in Section 11.03 herein) it will not sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any portion of 
the System, necessary or useful in the operation of the System, until all Bonds shall be paid in 
full, or unless and until provision shall have been made for the payment of all Bonds and the 
interest thereon in full, and the City further obligates itself and covenants and agrees with the 
Bondholders to maintain in good condition and to operate said System, and to collect and charge 
such rates for the services and facilities of the System so that the income and revenues of the 
System will be sufficient at all times to meet the requirements of this Bond Ordinance. If, 
pursuant to this Section, anything belonging to the System which is not deemed by the City to be 
necessary or useful therefor shall be sold or disposed of, the proceeds of such sale or disposition 
shall be deposited in the Depreciation Fund or Contingent Fund; 
 
(F) 
That it will permit, so long as there are any Bonds Outstanding, any Bondholder 
to inspect the System and all records and accounts thereof under reasonable terms and conditions 
and after reasonable notice has been given; 
 
45 
(G) 
That it will not make any use, and it shall direct the Trustee and each Fiduciary 
not to make any use of the proceeds of any Series of Bonds which Bonds were intended upon the 
issuance thereof to be exempt from federal income taxation, which, if such use had been 
reasonably expected on the date of the issuance of the Bonds of such Series would have caused 
such Bonds or any other Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Section 148 of the 
Code and will observe and not violate the requirements of Section 148 of the Code; 
 
(H) 
That, as to any Series of Bonds that was intended at the time of their issuance to 
be exempt from federal income taxation, it will take all actions required of it under the Code that

limitation, actions necessary to comply with all information reporting requirements and any 
obligation to rebate arbitrage earnings on the proceeds of such Bonds to the United States 
Government;

No provision of this Bond Ordinance shall prevent the combining of the System with any 
other utility system or enterprise of whatever type if such combination then be permitted or 
authorized by the provisions of the South Carolina Code and if the requirements set forth below 
are met; but no such combination shall impair the validity or priority of the pledge of revenues 
and the lien thereon created by this Bond Ordinance. The City shall have the right, from time to 
time, to add other utilities, enterprises, activities and facilities (which at the date of enactment of 
this Bond Ordinance were not included in the definition of System hereunder) to the definition of 
System hereunder, provided that:  
 
(A)

facilities are of a similar public utility nature as are the utilities now constituting the System; 
 
(B) 
if necessary, the City Council shall have adopted an appropriate amendatory 
ordinance to this Bond Ordinance;  
 
(C) 
the City shall have received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such 
action to be taken under this Section is authorized under this Bond Ordinance and the laws of the 
State and will not adversely affect the excludability of interest on the Bonds which were intended 
upon their issuance to be exempt from federal income taxation; and  
 
(D) 
for each of the five (5) Fiscal Years following the date of the additions to the 
System, Net Earnings, as shall have been forecasted either by Independent Consultants with a 
reputation for expertise in the type of enterprise being added to the System, by the Auditors or by 
the Finance Director, will be not less than 120% of the Annual Principal and Interest 
46 
Requirements on all Bonds then proposed to be Outstanding in each of such five (5) Fiscal 
Years; provided, however, that in the event that Bonds are being issued to acquire or improve the 
acquired utility, this paragraph (D) shall not apply and the City shall meet the requirements of 
Article IV hereof before issuing such Bonds and acquiring such utility. 
 
Section 11.03 
Sale, Exchange, Removal or Disposal of Component of System. 
 
(A) 
The City may from time to time sell, exchange, remove or dispose of (but not 
lease, contract or agree for the use thereof) an entire component comprising a part of the System, 
if it determines by ordinance: 
 
(1) 
that the sale, exchange, removal or other disposition thereof would not 
materially reduce Net Earnings; or  
 
(2) 
that the sale, exchange, removal or other disposition thereof (1) would not 
materially adversely affect the ability of the City to comply with the rate covenant, set forth in 
Section 5.01 hereof, for the current and next succeeding Fiscal Year, and (2) would be for a 
consideration of not less than reasonable value as may be determined in the sole discretion of the 
City Council.  
  
 
(B)

sell, exchange, remove or dispose of an entire component comprising a part of the System the 
following conditions shall also be met:

the City shall obtain an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that the sale, 
exchange, removal or disposal of a component of the System from the System has been effected 
in accordance with the terms of this Bond Ordinance; and  
 
(2) 
notice shall be provided by the City to any rating agency, if any, then 
rating any Series of Bonds regarding the sale, exchange, removal or disposal of such component 
from the System.  
 
(C)  
If the City sells, exchanges, removes or otherwise disposes a component of the 
System, the proceeds, if any, of such transaction may be applied, at the discretion of the City, as 
follows:  
 
(1) 
to the payment or satisfaction, in whole or in part, of (1) Bonds associated 
with or related to such component and (2) any other type of indebtedness of the City associated 
with or related to such component; or  
 
(2) 
to the payment or satisfaction, in whole or in part, of the amount due under 
any type of contractual obligations of the City associated with or related to such component; or  
 
(3) 
to the payment of the construction or purchase of additional improvements 
or expansions to the System.

plus all interest accrued thereon and which will accrue thereon to the date of payment. 
 
(B) 
At any time after the principal of the Bonds shall have been so declared to be due 
and payable and before the entry of final judgment or decree in any suit, action or proceeding 
instituted on account of such default, or before the completion of the enforcement of any other 
remedy under this Bond Ordinance, the Trustee shall annul such declaration and its 
consequences with respect to any Bonds not then due by their terms if:

(4) 
Every Event of Default known to the Trustee (other than a default in the 
payment of the principal of such Bonds then due only because of such declaration) shall 
have been remedied to the satisfaction of the Trustee. 
 
No such annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right 
consequent thereon.  
 
Section 14.02

and proceedings as it may be advised by counsel shall be necessary or expedient:  
 
(1) 
To prevent any impairment of the security under this Bond Ordinance by 
any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this Bond Ordinance; or 
 
(2) 
To preserve or protect the interests of the Bondholders, provided that such 
request is in accordance with law and the provisions of this Bond Ordinance and, in the 
sole judgment of the Trustee, is not unduly prejudicial to the interests of the Holders of 
Bonds not making such request.

When the Trustee incurs costs or expenses (including legal fees, costs and 
expenses) or renders services after the occurrence of an Event of Default, such costs and 
expenses and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of

other action under this Bond Ordinance which it may deem proper and which is not inconsistent 
with such direction by Bondholders.  
 
Section 14.07 
Individual Bondholder Action Restricted. 
 
(A) 
No Holder of any Bond shall have any right to institute any suit, action, or 
proceeding in equity or at law for the enforcement of this Bond Ordinance or for the execution of 
any trust hereunder or for any remedy under this Bond Ordinance unless:

Section 14.08 
Termination of Proceedings.

of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been 
determined adversely to the Trustee or the Bondholders, the City, the Trustee and the

Waiver and Nonwaiver of Event of Default. 
 
(A) 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of the Bonds to exercise any 
right or power accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or power or shall 
be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every 
power and remedy given by this Article XIV to the Trustee and the Holders of the Bonds, 
respectively, may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. 
 
(B) 
The Trustee may waive any Event of Default which in its opinion (and in reliance 
on the opinion of legal counsel as necessary) shall have been remedied before the entry of final

Bond Ordinance. 
  
(C) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Bond Ordinance to the contrary but 
subject to the provisions of Section 17.01 hereof, the Trustee, upon the written request of the 
Holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding 
(including, if more than one Series of Bonds shall at the time be Outstanding, the Holders of a 
majority in principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding of each such Series), shall waive any 
Event of Default hereunder and its consequences; provided, however, that except under the 
circumstances set forth in subsection (B) of Section 14.01 hereof or subsection (B) of this 
Section 14.09, a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any 
Bond, when the same shall become due and payable by the terms thereof or upon call for 
redemption, may not be waived without the written consent of the Holders of all the Bonds at the 
time Outstanding. 
 
(D) 
In case of any waiver by the Trustee of an Event of Default hereunder, the City, 
the Trustee, each Insurer and the Bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and 
rights under this Bond Ordinance, respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any 
subsequent or other Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. The Trustee shall 
not be responsible to anyone for waiving or refraining from waiving any Event of Default in 
accordance with this Section 14.09.

Section 15.16 
Additional Provisions Regarding the Trustee. 
 
 
The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing of all 
Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such 
duties as are specifically set forth in this Bond Ordinance, and no implied covenants or 
obligations should be read into this Bond Ordinance against the Trustee.  If any Event of Default 
under this Bond Ordinance shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such 
of the rights and powers vested in it by this Bond Ordinance and shall use the same degree of 
care as a prudent person would exercise or use in the circumstances in the conduct of such 
prudent person's own affairs. 
 
The Trustee agrees to perform the trust functions provided herein upon and subject to the 
following expressed terms and conditions: 
 
(A) 
The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereof and perform any of its 
duties by or through attorneys, agents or receivers appointed with due care.  
 
(B) 
The permissive items assigned to the Trustee as enumerated herein shall not be 
construed as a duty. 
 
62 
(C) 
The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the City of any 
money paid over by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Bond Ordinance. 
 
(D) 
Before taking any action under this Bond Ordinance relating to an Event of 
Default or in connection with its duties under this Bond Ordinance other than making payments 
of principal and interest on the Bonds as they become due or causing an acceleration of the 
Bonds whenever required by this Bond Ordinance, the Trustee may require that a satisfactory 
indemnity bond be furnished for the reimbursement of all costs and expenses to which it may be 
put (including legal fees, costs and expenses) and to protect it against all liability, including, but 
not limited to, any liability arising directly or indirectly under any federal, state or local statute, 
rule, law or ordinance related to the protection of the environment or hazardous substances and 
except liability which is adjudicated to have resulted from its own negligence or willful 
misconduct in connection with any action so taken. 
 
(E) 
The Trustee shall have no responsibility with respect to any information, 
statement or recital in any official statement, offering memorandum or any other disclosure 
material, including continuing disclosure material, prepared or distributed with respect to the 
Bonds and shall have no responsibility for compliance with any state or federal securities laws in 
connection with the Bonds. 
 
(F) 
None of the provisions of this Bond Ordinance shall require the Trustee to expend 
or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the 
performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it 
shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds cannot be assured to 
the Trustee’s satisfaction. 
 
(G) 
So long as investments are made in Authorized Investments, the Trustee may 
conclusively rely upon the City’s written instructions as to both the suitability and legality of all 
investments directed hereunder. To the extent invested in Authorized Investments, the Trustee 
shall have no responsibility to monitor the ratings of investments after the initial purchase of 
such investments. The Trustee may make any and all such investments through its own 
investment department or that of its affiliates or subsidiaries, and may charge reasonable fees for 
such trades, including cash sweep accounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in 
the absence of written investment instructions from the City, the Trustee shall not be responsible 
or liable for keeping moneys held by it hereunder fully invested. While invested in Authorized 
Investments, the Trustee shall not be liable for any losses or diminution in value from such 
investments executed pursuant to a written direction of the City. Broker confirmations of 
investments are not required to be issued by the Trustee for each month in which a monthly 
statement is rendered. 
 
(H) 
The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any financial statements 
delivered to it hereunder (including the audit required by Section 9.02 hereof) or verify the 
accuracy thereof and shall hold such financial statements solely as a repository for the benefit of 
the Bondholders; the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any information contained 
therein or Event of Default which may be disclosed therein. 
 
63 
(I) 
The City shall pay to the Trustee reasonable compensation for all services 
performed by it hereunder and also its reasonable expenses, charges and other disbursements and 
the fees, costs, and expenses of its attorneys, agents and employees incurred in and about the 
administration and the performance of its powers and duties hereunder.  If the Trustee is required 
by governmental agency or court proceeding initiated by a third party to undertake efforts 
beyond that which is set forth herein but related thereto, the Trustee shall notify the City of same 
in writing.  Payment for such extraordinary fees, costs and expenses (including but not limited to 
reasonable attorney’s fees, costs and expenses) shall be made promptly by the City only after 
said notice. 
 
(J) 
The Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the 
performance of its obligations under this Bond Ordinance arising out of or caused, directly or 
indirectly, by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation: acts of 
God; earthquakes; fire; flood; hurricanes or other catastrophic storms; wars; terrorism; similar 
military disturbances; sabotage; epidemic; pandemic; riots; interruptions; loss or malfunctions of 
utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications services; labor disputes; acts of 
civil or military authority or governmental action; it being understood that the Trustee shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking 
industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances. 
 
(K) 
Upon request from any Bondholder and absent any further direction or consent of 
the City, the Trustee shall disseminate a copy of the financial statements to such requester. 
 
(L) 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the Trustee is 
not otherwise acting in the capacity as dissemination agent, the Trustee shall not have any 
liability to any party in connection with any failure to timely file any notice with the Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board (via its EMMA system). 
 
(M) 
The Trustee shall have the right to accept and act upon directions or instructions 
delivered using Electronic Means; provided, however, that the City shall provide to the Trustee 
an incumbency certificate listing Qualified Officers with the authority to provide such directions 
or instructions (each a “Qualified Officer”) and containing specimen signatures of such 
Qualified Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended whenever a person is to be 
added or deleted from the listing. If the City elects to give the Trustee directions or instructions 
using Electronic Means, the Trustee’s understanding of such directions or instructions shall be 
deemed controlling. The City understands and agrees that the Trustee cannot determine the 
identity of the actual sender of such directions or instructions and that the Trustee shall 
conclusively presume that directions or instructions that purport to have been sent by an 
Qualified Officer listed on the incumbency certificate provided to the Trustee have been sent by 
such Qualified Officer. The City shall be responsible for ensuring that only Qualified Officers 
transmit such directions or instructions to the Trustee and that all Qualified Officers treat 
applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys as confidential 
and with extreme care.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising 
directly or indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon and compliance with such directions or 
instructions notwithstanding such directions or instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a 
subsequent written direction or written instruction.  The City agrees: (i) to assume all risks 
64 
arising out of the use of Electronic Means to submit directions or instructions to the Trustee, 
including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized directions or 
instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed 
of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting directions or 
instructions to the Trustee and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting directions 
or instructions and (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its 
transmission of directions or instructions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of 
protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances.

Trustee or such other escrow holder to forthwith return said funds to the City.  
 
66 
Section 16.03 
Deposits with Trustee Subject to Conditions of Article XVI. 
 
 
The City covenants and agrees that any money which it shall deposit with the Trustee 
shall be deemed to be deposited in accordance with, and subject to, the applicable provisions of 
this Article, and that whenever it shall have elected to redeem Bonds it will irrevocably bind and 
obligate itself to give notice of redemption thereof, and will further authorize, empower and 
direct the Trustee to cause the publication of such notice of redemption in its name and on its 
behalf.  
 
Section 16.04

Outstanding for all purposes, not be defeased or otherwise satisfied and not be considered paid 
by the City until the Insurer has been reimbursed in full therefor in accordance with the terms of 
the Municipal Bond Insurance Policy, and the assignment and pledge of the Gross Revenues of

Holders shall continue to exist and shall run to the benefit of the Insurer, and the Insurer shall be

ARTICLE XVII 
 
MISCELLANEOUS 
 
Section 17.01 
Miscellaneous Rights of an Insurer. 
 
(A) 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Bond Ordinance to the contrary, each 
Insurer shall be deemed the exclusive Holder of all Bonds insured by that Insurer, for the 
purposes of all approvals, consents, waivers, institution of any action, and the direction of all 
remedies. No rights granted to an Insurer by this Bond Ordinance shall be effective at any time 
that such Insurer is in breach of its obligations under the Municipal Bond Insurance Policy, has 
committed a default under the Municipal Bond Insurance Policy, or is subject to bankruptcy or 
receivership proceedings.  
 
(B) 
Any provision of this Bond Ordinance expressly recognizing or granting rights in 
or to an Insurer may not be amended in any manner which affects the rights of such Insurer 
hereunder without the prior written consent of each such Insurer. 
 
(C) 
To the extent that an Insurer makes payment of the principal of or interest on any 
Bonds, it shall become the owner and Holder of such Bonds, appurtenant coupons or right to 
payment of such principal of or interest on such Bonds and shall be fully subrogated to all of the 
registered Holders’ rights thereunder, including the registered Holders’ rights to payment 
thereof. To evidence such subrogation (i) in the case of subrogation as to claims for past due

claims for past due principal, the Trustee shall note the Insurer’s rights as subrogee on the 
registration books of the City maintained by the Trustee or Registrar upon surrender of the 
Bonds by the registered Holders thereof to the Insurer or its agent. 
 
(D) 
In the event that the principal of and/or interest on any Bonds shall be paid by the 
Insurer pursuant to the terms of its Municipal Bond Insurance Policy, (i) such Bonds shall 
continue to be “Outstanding” under this Bond Ordinance and (ii) the assignment and pledge of 
the Gross Revenues and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the City to the 
registered Holders shall continue to exist, and the Insurer shall be fully subrogated to all of the 
rights of such registered Holders in accordance with the terms and conditions of subparagraph 
(C) above and the Insurer’s Municipal Bond Insurance Policy. 
 
(E) 
The terms and provisions of this Bond Ordinance or of any applicable Series 
Ordinance may not be terminated as long as there are any moneys owed to an Insurer under such 
terms and provisions of this Bond Ordinance or the applicable Series Ordinance or any 
agreement between such Insurer and the City.  
 
 
68 
Section 17.02 
Purpose of Covenants in Bond Ordinance. 
 
 
Every covenant, undertaking and agreement made on behalf of the City, as set forth in 
this Bond Ordinance and any Series Ordinance is made, undertaken and agreed to, for the proper 
securing of the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds. Each shall be deemed to 
partake of the obligation of the contract between the City and the Bondholders and shall be 
enforceable accordingly. In this connection, any provider of a surety bond, line of credit, 
insurance policy or letter of credit as contemplated under Section 7.04(D) hereof may enforce the 
terms, conditions and obligations under this Bond Ordinance as a third party beneficiary 
hereunder. Nothing in this Bond Ordinance or any Series Ordinance expressed or implied is 
intended or shall be construed to confer upon, or to give to, any person or entity, other than the 
City, an Insurer, the Trustee, and the registered owners of the Bonds, any right, remedy or claim 
under or by reason of this Bond Ordinance or any covenant, condition or stipulation hereof, and 
all covenants, stipulations, promises and agreements in this Bond Ordinance or a related Series 
Ordinance contained by and on behalf of the City shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of 
the City, an Insurer, the Trustee, and the registered owners of the Bonds.  
 
Section 17.03 
Severability. 
 
 
If any Section, paragraph, clause or provision of this Bond Ordinance shall be held 
invalid, the invalidity of such Section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect any of the

Remedies Granted by Ordinance Not Being Available to Holders of Other 
Bonds.

by the Bond Ordinance or any Series Ordinance to the Holders of any Bond is not available to 
the Holders of all other Bonds, then such rights and remedies are herewith conferred upon the 
Holders of such other Bonds.  
 
Section 17.05 
Authorization to Sign. 
 
 
For purposes of all consents and other necessary documentation associated with the 
issuance of Bonds, the Authorized Officers and the Clerk shall be authorized to sign on behalf of

the issuance of the bonds provided for herein, the City Council of the City of Beaufort (the 
“City Council”), the governing body of the City of Beaufort, South Carolina (the “City”), finds 
that the facts set forth in this Article exist and the following statements are in all respects true 
and correct: 
 
(A) 
The City Council has made general provision for the issuance from time to time 
of Stormwater System Revenue Bonds (the “Bonds”) of the City by a bond ordinance entitled 
“A MASTER BOND ORDINANCE PROVIDING FOR THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF 
STORMWATER SYSTEM REVENUE BONDS OF THE CITY OF BEAUFORT, SOUTH 
CAROLINA; AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO” enacted by the City Council 
on June 23, 2020 (the “Bond Ordinance”). Terms with initial capitals and not otherwise 
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Bond Ordinance. 
 
(B) 
It is provided in and by the Bond Ordinance that, upon enactment of a “Series 
Ordinance,” there may be issued one or more Series of Bonds for the purpose of, among other 
things: (1) obtaining funds for the acquiring, purchasing, constructing, improving, enlarging, 
and repairing of the System and improvements and additions thereto, including the recoupment 
or reimbursement of funds already so expended; (2) providing funds for the payment of any 
bond anticipation notes; (3) refunding Bonds or other obligations; (4) providing funds for the 
payment of interest due on any Bonds; (5) funding a Debt Service Reserve Fund, if any, in an 
amount equal to the Reserve Requirement; and (6) paying the costs of issuance of Bonds, 
including any credit enhancement therefor. 
 
(C) 
The City currently has no indebtedness payable from the revenues derived from 
the System. 
 
(D) 
The City has determined to issue the Series 2020 Bonds (as defined herein) to:

renovated or replaced stormwater lines and related infrastructure (the “2020 Project”); (2) 
provide for the refunding of all or a portion of its $6,000,000 General Obligation Bond, Series 
2018, dated December 10, 2018 (the “Refunded Bond”); (3) fund, if necessary, the 2020 Debt 
Service Reserve Fund (as defined herein) in a manner permitted by the Bond Ordinance; and 
(4) pay the costs of issuance of the Series 2020 Bonds.

The Series 2020 Bonds may be sold on a competitive basis as set forth at Section 8.02 
hereof, or on a negotiated basis as set forth at Section 8.03 hereof, as determined by an 
Authorized Officer. 
 
Section 8.02 
Competitive Sale. 
 
The Series 2020 Bonds may be sold at a date and time certain after public notice thereof. 
Bids may be received at such time and date and in such manner as determined by an Authorized 
Officer. Unless all bids are rejected, the award of the Series 2020 Bonds may be made by an 
Authorized Officer to the bidder offering the most advantageous terms to the City, with the basis 
of such award and the date and time certain for opening bids to be set forth in a request for 
proposals used in connection with the sale of the Series 2020 Bonds (the “RFP”). 
 
Any Series of Series 2020 Bonds sold on a competitive sale basis may be sold pursuant to 
either of the following methods as determined by an Authorized Officer:  
 
(A) 
Competitive Direct Placement. Any Series 2020 Bonds may be sold to an 
institution or institutions as a single instrument as a means of making a 
commercial loan (a “Direct Placement Purchaser”). The City Council authorizes 
an Authorized Officer to distribute the RFP to prospective purchasers of Series 
2020 Bonds and award such Series 2020 Bonds to a Direct Placement Purchaser 
on the basis of the terms and conditions contained therein. Such Series 2020 
Bonds shall be issued as a single Bond (or separate single Bonds if the Series 
2020 Bonds are sold in multiple Series), without CUSIP identification (unless 
otherwise agreed by the Direct Placement Purchaser and an Authorized Officer on 
behalf of the City), shall not be issued in book-entry-only form, and no official 
statement shall be prepared in connection with the sale of such Series 2020 
Bonds. The Direct Placement Purchaser of any such Series 2020 Bonds shall 
execute an investor letter to the City acknowledging its purchase of such Bonds as 
a means of making a commercial loan. 
 
(B) 
Competitive Public Offering. Any Series 2020 Bonds may be sold in the public 
capital markets to an underwriter for the purpose of reselling such Series 2020 
Bonds. In such case, the City Council hereby authorizes an Authorized Officer to 
prepare, or cause to be prepared, a preliminary official statement and distribute 
the preliminary official statement and the RFP (or official notice of sale) to 
prospective purchasers of Series 2020 Bonds. The City Council authorizes an 
Authorized Officer to designate the preliminary official statement as “final” for 
purposes of Rule 15c2-12 of the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Rule 
 
17 
15c2-12”). The Authorized Officer is further authorized to see to the completion 
of the final form of the official statement upon the sale of such Series 2020 Bonds 
so that it may be provided to the underwriter of such Series 2020 Bonds. 
 
Section 8.03 
Negotiated Sale. 
 
Any Series 2020 Bonds sold on a negotiated basis may be sold pursuant to either of the 
following methods as determined by an Authorized Officer. 
(A) 
Negotiated Direct Placement. Any Series 2020 Bonds may be sold to a Direct 
Placement Purchaser as a means of making a commercial loan pursuant to 
negotiation, with or without providing for distribution of an RFP. In such case, the 
City Council authorizes an Authorized Officer to solicit, or cause to be solicited, 
financing proposals from prospective purchasers of Series 2020 Bonds and award 
the Series 2020 Bonds after negotiation with prospective purchasers. Such Series 
2020 Bonds shall be issued as a single Series (or separate single Bonds if the 
Series 2020 Bonds are sold in multiple Series), without CUSIP identification 
(unless otherwise agreed by the Direct Placement Purchaser and an Authorized 
Officer on behalf of the City). The Direct Placement Purchaser of such Series 
2020 Bonds shall execute an investor letter to the City acknowledging its 
purchase of the Series 2020 Bonds as a means of making a commercial loan. 
 
(B) 
Negotiated Public Offering. Any Series 2020 Bonds may be sold to an 
underwriter pursuant to the terms of a bond purchase agreement for resale in the 
public capital markets. The underwriter shall be selected after soliciting proposals 
for the same and the bond purchase agreement shall be executed by an Authorized 
Officer upon advice of Bond Counsel and the Financial Advisor. The execution of 
the bond purchase agreement by such Authorized Officer shall constitute 
conclusive evidence of his or her approval thereof. In such case, the City Council 
hereby authorizes an Authorized Officer to prepare, or cause to be prepared, a 
preliminary official statement and authorize the distribution of the preliminary 
official statement by the underwriter. The City Council authorizes an Authorized 
Officer to designate the preliminary official statement as “final” for purposes of 
Rule 15c2-12. Such Authorized Officer is further authorized to see to the 
completion of the final form of the official statement upon the sale of such Series 
2020 Bonds so that it may be provided to the underwriter.

TAX AND SECURITIES LAW COVENANTS 
 
Section 9.01 
Tax Covenants. 
(A) 
General Tax Covenant. The City will comply with all requirements of the Code in 
order to preserve the tax-exempt status of the Series 2020 Bonds, including without limitation, (i) 
the requirement to file Form 8038-G, Information Return for Tax-Exempt Government 
Obligations, with the Internal Revenue Service, and (ii) the requirement to rebate certain 
arbitrage earnings to the United States Government pursuant to Section 148(f) of the Code. In 
this connection, the City covenants to execute any and all agreements or other documentation as 
it may be advised by Bond Counsel will enable it to comply with this Section 9.01, including its 
certification on reasonable grounds that the Series 2020 Bonds are not “arbitrage bonds” within 
the meaning of Section 148 of the Code. 
 
 
(B) 
Tax Representations. The City hereby represents and covenants that it will not 
take any action which will, or fail to take any action which failure will, cause interest on the 
Series 2020 Bonds to become includable in the gross income of the Holders thereof for federal 
income tax purposes pursuant to the provisions of the Code and the United States Treasury 
Regulations (the “Regulations”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the City 
represents and covenants that: 
 
(1) 
All property financed or refinanced with the proceeds of the Series 2020 
Bonds will be owned by the City or another political subdivision of the State so long as 
the Series 2020 Bonds are Outstanding in accordance with the rules governing the 
ownership of property for federal income tax purposes. 
 
(2) 
The City shall not use, and will not permit any party to use, the proceeds 
of the Series 2020 Bonds, or any bonds refunded thereby, in any manner that would result 
in (i) 10% or more of such proceeds being considered as having been used directly or 
indirectly in any trade or business carried on by any Nongovernmental Person, (ii) 5% or 
more of such proceeds being considered as having been used directly or indirectly in any 
trade or business of any Nongovernmental Person that is either “unrelated” or 
“disproportionate” to the governmental use of the financed facility by the City or by any 
other Governmental Unit (as the terms “unrelated” and “disproportionate” are defined for 
purposes of Section 141(b)(3) of the Code) or (iii) 5% or more of such proceeds being 
considered as having been used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans to any 
Nongovernmental Person. 
(3) 
The City is not a party to, and will not enter into or permit any other party 
to enter into, any contract with any person involving the management of any facility 
financed or refinanced with the proceeds of the Series 2020 Bonds or by notes paid by the 
Series 2020 Bonds that does not conform to the guidelines set forth in Revenue Procedure 
2017-13, or a successor revenue procedure, Code provision or Regulations.  
 
20 
(4) 
The City will not sell, or permit any other party to sell, any property 
financed or refinanced with the Series 2020 Bonds to any person unless it obtains an 
opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel that such sale will not affect the tax-
exempt status of the Series 2020 Bonds.   
(5) 
The Series 2020 Bonds will not be “federally guaranteed” within the 
meaning of Section 149(b) of the Code. The City shall not enter into, or permit any other 
party to enter into, any leases or sales or service contract with any federal government 
agency with respect to any facility financed or refinanced with the proceeds of the Series 
2020 Bonds and will not enter into any such leases or contracts unless it obtains the 
opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel that such action will not affect the tax-
exempt status of the Series 2020 Bonds. 
(C) 
Arbitrage Bonds, Rebate. The City covenants that no use of the proceeds of the 
sale of the Series 2020 Bonds shall be made which, if such use had been reasonably expected on 
the date of issue of such Bonds would have caused the Series 2020 Bonds to be “arbitrage 
bonds” as defined in the Code, and to that end the City shall: 
 
(1) 
comply with the applicable regulations of the Treasury Department 
previously promulgated under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as 
amended, and any regulations promulgated under the Code, so long as the Series 2020 
Bonds are Outstanding; 
(2) 
establish such funds, make such calculations and pay such amounts, in the 
manner and at the times required in order to comply with the requirements of the Code 
and Regulations relating to required rebate of certain amounts to the United States 
Government; 
(3) 
make such reports of such information at the time and places required by 
the Code and Regulations; and 
(4) 
take such other action as may be required to assure that the tax-exempt 
status of the Series 2020 Bonds will not be impaired. 
(D) 
Tax Certificate. An Authorized Officer is hereby authorized and directed to 
execute, at or prior to delivery of any Series of Bonds, a certificate or certificates specifying 
actions taken or to be taken by the City, and the reasonable expectations of such officials, with 
respect to such Series of Bonds, the proceeds thereof, or the City. 
 
(E) 
Bank Qualified. Series 2020 Bonds may be designated by an Authorized Officer 
pursuant to Article V hereof as “qualified tax-exempt obligations” in accordance with Section 
265(b)(3)(B) of the Code. 
 
(F) 
Reimbursement Declaration. The City hereby declares its intention to reimburse 
itself for a portion of the costs of the 2020 Project with the proceeds of Series 2020 Bonds. To 
that end, the City Council determines and declares as follows: 
 
 
21 
(1) 
no funds from any sources other than the Series 2020 Bonds are or are 
reasonably expected to be, reserved, allocated on a long-term basis or otherwise set aside 
by the City pursuant to the budget or financial policies of the City for the financing of the 
portion of the costs of acquisition, construction, and equipping of the 2020 Project to be 
funded with the Series 2020 Bonds; 
 
(2) 
the City reasonably expects that all or a portion of the expenditures 
incurred for the 2020 Project and the issuance of the Series 2020 Bonds will be paid prior 
to the issuance of the Series 2020 Bonds; 
 
(3) 
the City intends and reasonably expects to reimburse itself for all such 
expenditures paid by it with respect to the 2020 Project prior to the issuance of the Series 
2020 Bonds from the proceeds of the Series 2020 Bonds, and such intention is consistent 
with the budgetary and financial circumstances of the City;  
 
(4) 
all of the costs to be paid or reimbursed from the proceeds of the Series 
2020 Bonds will be for costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Series 2020 
Bonds, or will, at the time of payment thereof, be properly chargeable to the capital 
account of the 2020 Project (or would be so chargeable with a proper election) under 
general federal income tax principles; and 
 
(5) 
this 2020 Series Ordinance shall constitute a declaration of official intent 
under United States Department of the Treasury Regulation Section 1.150-2. 
 
(G) 
Taxable Bonds. Prior to the issuance of a Series of Bonds, an Authorized Officer 
may, in consultation with Bond Counsel, designate a Series of Bonds as taxable under the Code. 
The election to issue a Series of Taxable Bonds shall be clearly indicated by including the phrase 
“Taxable Series,” or words to that effect, in the series designation of such Taxable Bonds. The 
above provisions of this Section 9.01 shall not be applicable to any Series of Taxable Bonds. 
 
Section 9.02 
Securities Law Covenants. 
 
(A) 
The City hereby covenants and agrees that it will comply with and carry out all of 
the provisions of any continuing disclosure certificate or agreement, executed by an Authorized 
Officer and dated the date of delivery of the Series 2020 Bonds, which will meet the 
requirements, as applicable, of Section 11-1-85 of the South Carolina Code, which may require, 
among other things, that the City file with a central repository when requested:  
 
(1) 
a copy of its annual independent audit within 30 days of its receipt and 
acceptance, and  
 
(2)  
event-specific information, within 30 days of an event adversely affecting more 
than five percent of its revenues or five percent of its tax base.  
 
The only remedy for failure by the City to comply with the covenants in this Section 9.02 shall 
be an action for specific performance of this covenant. The City specifically reserves the right to 
 
22 
amend this covenant to reflect any change in Section 11-1-85 of the South Carolina Code, 
without the consent of any Bondholder. 
 
(B) 
The City hereby covenants and agrees that it will comply with and carry out all of 
the provisions of any continuing disclosure certificate, executed by an Authorized Officer and 
dated the date of delivery of the Series 2020 Bonds, which will meet the requirements, as 
applicable, of Rule 15c2-12 (the “Continuing Disclosure Undertaking”). Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this 2020 Series Ordinance, failure of the City to comply with the Continuing 
Disclosure Undertaking shall not be considered an event of default hereunder; however, any 
Bondholder may take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate, including seeking 
mandamus or specific performance by court order, to cause the City to comply with its 
obligations under this Section. The execution of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking shall 
constitute conclusive evidence of the approval by the person executing the same of any and all 
modifications and amendments thereto. Additionally, an Authorized Officer is authorized to 
contract with a dissemination agent for certain dissemination services associated with the 
execution and delivery of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking. 
 
(C) 
In the event any Series 2020 Bonds are not sold as securities, but rather sold to a 
Direct Placement Purchaser as a commercial loan, no Continuing Disclosure Undertaking shall 
be required as to such Series 2020 Bonds, but the City may covenant to provide information to 
the purchaser of such Series of Series 2020 Bonds as may be mutually agreed.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
On May 12,2020, City Council authorized negotiations with the recommended contractor, Great Southern
Recreation, on RFP 2020-112 - Waterfront Park Playground equipment.  The negotiations were successful and
the design was solidified, reducing the overall cost of the project from the proposed price of $298,682 to
$274,654.30.  
 
Additional background on this project is related to a $500,000 Land Water Conservation Grant, requiring a
$500K match from the City.  This grant was awarded in November 2018.  City resources for the grant were set
aside at that time in the Capital Projects fund as required on the grant.  The scope of the grant funded project
was: major repairs to the waterfront park pilings, new playground equipment and improvements to the Scott
Street entrance.
 
The major repairs to the Waterfront Park pilings is complete and with the negotiated cost for the playground
equipment there are sufficient remaining resources of the project available to complete the Scott Street entrance
, thereby satisfying the grant compliance on the overall scope of the project.
 
The grant closeout and project is required to be complete in totality by September 30, 2020.
