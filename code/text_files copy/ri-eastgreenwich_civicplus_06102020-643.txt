INSTRUCTIONS TO ACCESS THE MEETING 
 
The information provided is to assist board members, applicants and their 
representatives, residents and other interested parties with the technical information 
necessary to participate. 
 
The Town has chosen to use a video conferencing product called ZOOM for hosting 
local public meetings during the current health emergency.  Zoom is available as an 
app – you can download it your smart phone or personal computer for free.  (Deluxe 
4 
 
“for-a-fee” versions also exist and many of you may already be using those in your 
own personal or business dealings.)  You will also have the low-tech option of simply 
phone dialing-in for audio-only.   
 
Attendees are encouraged to test their internet connection and audio capabilities in 
advance of the meeting.  Please use the following link for detailed information from 
Zoom on how to test your equipment: 
 https://support.zoom.us/hc/en/-us/articles/115002262083 
 
We strongly encourage you to access the meeting visually – for obvious transparency 
reasons, so you can see Board members and applicants – but also because the 
presentations will be on-screen (plan sets and related reports) to round out your 
understanding of what is being considered.   
 
To be clear, you do not have to have a Zoom account to attend a Zoom meeting. You 
may wish to create an account, but that is not required to participate in the Town’s 
“virtual” public meetings.  We hope you will join us via Smartphone, tablet, laptop, or 
computer as this option enables you to view the Board and presenters in a gallery view 
and to see all application materials presented on your screen.  If accessing the meeting 
this way, you will be prompted to download the software.  You can get to the meeting 
by either clicking the hyperlink in the posted agenda (available via the Town’s or 
Secretary of State’s Website) OR  -   
 
Go to Zoom.us and Simply Click on “Join a Meeting”. 
When you go to the Zoom website, you will be prompted to either JOIN or 
DOWNLOAD the Zoom tool. Note t he download will require a second step to 
install the application. This is a personal choice. 
 
Enter this Webinar/Meeting ID: 849 6848 6445 
(The meeting ID will be different for every zoom meeting/webinar you join.  The meeting ID above 
is specific to the June 10, 2020 HDC meeting.) 
 
To join you will be asked for your name and email. Your name is all that is required. 
 
You will be asked if you want to join the meeting audio via computer audio, or 
via telephone. Use of computer audio is recommended, if enabled on your device, 
however you can also use your telephone for audio.  When you enter the meeting 
room, your phone will be muted.  You will be able to see members and participate 
when called on for public comment.  If you would like to speak when the Chair 
opens the floor for public comment, use the ‘raise your hand’ icon in the Zoom 
platform, located toward the bottom of the screen.  You will be recognized to 
5 
 
speak and can share your comments via audio when recognized.  You will be 
prompted on your screen to unmute yourself and you will be required to state your 
name for the record.   
 
If Accessing the Meeting By Telephone: 
If you do not wish to or if you do not have a device capable of accessing the internet-
based Zoom meeting, you may use your telephone – land line or cellular - for audio-
only access to the proceedings.   
Dial this number to join:  +1 929 205 6099 
Alternative phone numbers can be used if necessary (if the line rings busy, for 
example): 
 +1 312 626 6799 (Chicago); or +1 346 248 7799 (Houston); 
 or +1 669 900 6833 (CA);  or  +1 301 715 8592 (Maryland). 
 
Enter this Webinar/Meeting ID: 849 6848 6445 
 
Then press # and then # again (there are no “Participant ID’s”). 
When you join the meeting, your phone will be muted. 
At the appropriate time, the meeting will be open for questions and comments. 
During the public comment portion of the meeting, anyone who wishes to be heard 
will be allowed to speak. Only one commenter at a time will be allowed to speak to 
ensure the comment is clearly heard and recorded.  To be recognized, you will need to 
“raise your hand”.  Dial *9 to ‘raise your hand’ and be recognized to speak.  Dial *6 
to unmute your telephone; and when done speaking, dial *6  again to mute yourself.  
All speakers will be required to state their name for the record. 
For  Scheduled Historic District Commission Hearings 
Accessing applications, site plans and other documents: 
All materials submitted for consideration will be made available on the Town’s 
website well in advance of the scheduled meeting.  You will want to visit the Planning 
Department’s page via the ‘eastreenwichri.com’ site.  There you will see a sidebar 
heading called “Current Projects” where all relevant materials are placed and labeled.  
{To get to this location directly, please go to: 
http://www.eastgreenwichri.com/648/Current-Projects  }  Alternatively, once the 
6 
 
agenda for the meeting is posted online, hyperlinks to the relevant application 
materials will be inserted for ease of access. 
Please do not hesitate to call the Planning Department at 401-886-8645 or 401-886-
886-8643 or contact Lea Anthony Hitchen at lanthony@eastgreenwichri.com  if you 
need help viewing any information.   
All interested parties who anticipate participating in this meeting are strongly 
encouraged to contact the Planning Department at 401-886-8645 or 401-886-8643 in 
advance.  This is especially true if you expect to present evidence during the meeting 
(photographs, petitions, or other documents) as these will need to be officially entered 
into the record and marked appropriately as exhibits.  Your cooperation is greatly 
appreciated.   
Remember, you do not have to have a webcam to join a Zoom video conference or 
meeting. You will still be able to use your computer, laptop, etc. for access but 
will not be able to transmit your video. However, you will be able to listen to the 
proceedings and view any screen sharing. 
Basic Zoom Audio Troubleshooting: 
 
If you are recognized to speak, but cannot be heard in the Zoom meeting, 
please use the following steps to troubleshoot your computer audio or telephone 
connection. 
 
• Ensure your microphone or telephone is unmuted. Remember on a phone, 
*6 toggles the mute/unmute feature.  For users joining the meeting via 
computer video conference, you will find your ‘mute’ control in the lower left 
corner of the Zoom meeting screen.  
• If you still cannot be heard and have joined by computer audio, you may 
need to switch to a telephone to improve the audio connection. Click on the 
‘drop-down’ menu located beside the ‘mute’ control on the screen to change 
your audio connection to telephone. Use the information that pops-up on the 
Zoom screen to join the meeting using a telephone. You will need to enter 
the meeting id after calling the phone number. 
• If you are still unable to be heard, you may need to disconnect from the Zoom 
meeting and rejoin. If you continue to have trouble during the meeting, you 
will need to use the ‘Q&A’ function on the Zoom screen to inform the 
Meeting Host that you cannot be heard.
