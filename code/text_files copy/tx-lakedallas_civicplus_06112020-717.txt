2. Invocation and Pledges of Allegiance 
Mayor Barnhart led the invocation and the pledges. 
3. Announcements & Special Recognitions.    
 
A. City Manager’s Report 
City Manager John Cabrales updated the Council regarding COVID-19 for the City, 
County and State.   
4. Citizen Agenda & Public Comments 
Mayor Barnhart opened the Visitors/Citizens Agenda.  
 
City Manager John Cabrales read the following into record.  
 
Sheila Daniel of 621 Beck Ave, Lake Dallas, Texas. 
Please do not approve either of the zoning change requests on the agenda. Much time and 
money was spent soliciting input from citizens of Lake Dallas for the 2030 Vision and 
developing the new zoning map. Most of the council members were in service at the time that 
vision was implemented. I don't recall high density housing being a highly requested item. 
Each of these developments will bring higher density populations which increase traffic and 
overload the public services.  While some might argue four story apartments are progress and 
will increase property tax base, the cost of city services and the cost of traffic & lifestyle to the 
neighborhoods are high. 
Page 2 of 11 
 
If the developers are interested in helping the Lake Dallas community, their plans will reflect 
that. Talks of benefiting the community are rather vague and not backed with much thought or 
cost to the developers. Are either properties planning to save any of the mature trees? Clear 
cutting the land and not making any environmentally friendly efforts tends to make me think 
the intent is strictly to maximize their profits. Replacing quality mature trees with 3” caliper 
trees on smaller lot sizes is not in the interest of the environment or community and doesn’t 
necessarily fit the term of quality development in my mind. Many of our old mature trees have 
been removed from our town to be replaced with concrete and tiny trees. What is the cost to 
drainage, flooding and the watershed in such close proximity to the lake?  
 On the corner of Shady Shores & Swisher they want to split commercial and higher density 
housing. If you want to benefit the community build the commercial and increase the sales tax 
base first and then talk about higher density housing. The plan seems to be increasing 
population and then maybe we can get someone else to put in the commercial. What size is 
that dog park? How is it landscaped/equipped? And how much will it cost the city to maintain 
it?  Parking for citizens to walk their dog? If you are so sure traffic is not going to be a problem, 
why aren’t you willing to pay up front for that traffic study?  I see no plans to improve the 
infrastructure to allow for turn lanes. Seems to me benefits are loaded on developer side. 
Though we all recognize it is about the money and developers need return on their investment, 
seems to me we are being duped with sales pitch of benefits to community to get the zoning 
changed and then council no longer has a say.  
  
Once the zoning is changed then it will be "we can't legally do anything about it the zoning 
allows them to do it." Please protect the zoning that you put in place. 
 
Mark Wilson of 508 Howard Drive stated that there is a drainage problem on Howard Drive 
which was causing foundation problems to his home.  He stated there a low stop where the 
water starts to backup.  He stated he would like for the City to look at what can be done to fix 
the problem.

Mayor Barnhart open the public hearing at 8:33 p.m.  
Sheila Daniel of 621 Beck Ave, Lake Dallas, Texas, against the proposed zoning change. (Read 
by Mr. Cabrales). 
Donna Hammond, 761 Winding Oak Bend, Lake Dallas, TX 75065. (Read by Mr. Cabrales) 
Thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinions even if not in person.  I know my time is 
short so I will include an Addendum to this that you may choose to read openly or for review. 
Because of the Covid-19 shutdown we have been unable as a community to meet with the 
developer in person as was hoped for after our Planning and Zoning Committee meeting.  I 
think this meeting would have been crucial in helping us as a community impacted by this 
proposed change to understand the necessity – currently my feelings are it is strictly monetary 
on the part of the developer – I understand that the City would benefit from additional tax 
dollars and permit fees as well. 
As a resident of this area for many years and Thousand Oaks for 5, I chose this area for its 
rural/suburban appeal.  The area is zoned R-1-7200 as is most property north of Swisher Rd.  
Your own Vision 2030 refers to this area as Suburban Residential with no mention of 
minimizing zoning for the benefit of a developer – it appears to be written with the City and 
Residents in mind.   
I am concerned that the change in zoning to Planned Development District will lessen the 
quality of life in the northern city area as this borders on Shady Shores where the minimum lot 
size is set at ½ acre.   
While infrastructure such as electric and (hopefully) water will probably not be impacted by 
this change in density I fear that the storm water runoff, sewer (our lift station appears to 
struggle as is), internet/cable and cell service will.  In addition, this development will coincide 
with the addition of a 300 unit apartment/mixed use development on Swisher Rd.  This alone 
will dramatically affect the traffic at the intersection of Shady Shore Rd and Swisher Rd – an 
intersection already plagued with increased traffic using the toll bridge.  Surface conditions of 
the surrounding roads (Dobbs and Shady Shores) is rough on a good day and continues to 
degrade – potholes, flooding and traffic are a continual issue. 
Not having a child in school any longer I am not familiar with the current classroom density 
level however I see that the addition of the 3 proposed developments could greatly impact the 
Page 4 of 11 
 
school system as the children in these families move from Level to Level. (We only have 1 
High School). 
I strongly urge the Council to not approve the change in Zoning from R-1-7200  to Planned 
Development District as the rules are firmly in place for R-1-7200 but the rules for Planned 
Development are not and can be changed at the stroke of a pen if the changes are deemed “not 
material”. 
If the Council chooses to proceed with the approval of Zoning Change I ask that you refer to 
the Attached Addendum for concessions already agreed to and those I propose. 
 
Mike Rakes, 766 Texas Oak Trail, Lake Dallas Texas. (read by Mr. Cabrales) 
I am writing you today in concerns of the development going in at 707 N. Shady Shores Drive 
Lake Dallas Tx 75065. Through the times we are going through we all have had the chance to 
encounter the flooding shady shores rd. I looked into draining issues and regulations for off 
site drainage since my down spots deck drains and yard all drain towards this property. And 
with them planning on building houses 15 feet from my back yard which we have an electrical 
easement all the way down the property they plan to build on which I do not see in the plane 
at all listed and access points to this easement. I have listed our ordinance and listed points that 
I have concerns over and things that would be nice to see before we allow this huge 
development. In this sections it list that the builder is responsible for all drainage in and out of 
his property (a) Sec. 94-163. - Off-site drainage. The owner or developer of property to be 
developed or constructed shall be responsible for all rainfall, stormwater and floodwater 
drainage flowing on and from his property. This responsibility includes the drainage directed 
to that property by ultimate development, drainage naturally flowing through the property by 
reason of topography, and drainage affecting property downstream. 1. I had a bid to redirect 
my drainage and its around $44k since I have to redo my entire decking and drainage around 
my house so that I can pump the drain water back to the street that’s up another 6 feet and 100 
feet to the street. WHO PAYS FOR THIS?? Since I have not seen a plan on how the developer 
plans to handle this situation, I have to figure stuff out myself. I believe the developer is way 
under prepared for this billion-dollar job when they have no answers in how or what they will 
do. All we have heard is wait until we get in there and we can figure it out. My house is too 
close and evolved to let that be the case. I am a general contractor who does residential pool 
and back yard renovations which are no more than $100k job and I have to present a better 
design than any of the builders that have spoken have presented. I have a pic attached of the 
designs that are required by me at a lot lower price scale. (b) 1. The residents Have not seen 
any of this on how they prepare to drain their water into an already flooded street and smaller 
trailer park development across the street. (c) On lots or tracts of three acres or more, rainfall, 
stormwater and floodwater drainage shall not be permitted onto adjacent or downstream 
property except in existing creeks, channels or storm sewers, unless proper drainage easements 
or notarized letters of permission from the affected property owners are provided. If necessary 
easements or letters of permission cannot be obtained, 1(the city engineer will review the 
downstream damage potential and make recommendations to the planning and zoning 
Page 5 of 11 
 
commission and the city council where preliminary or final plat review and approval is sought. 
If downstream damage potential exists as a result of the proposed subdivision, development or 
construction, no development, construction or building permit shall be issued until adequate 
provision has been made to eliminate such potential.) Where a development, construction or 
building permit has been refused, the applicant's sole remedy shall be too perfect an appeal to 
the city's board of adjustment, whose decision Adequate consideration shall be given by the 
owner in the development of property to determine how the discharge leaving the proposed 
development will affect adjacent property. in the matter shall be final. The board of adjustment 
shall have the authority in such cases to grant special exceptions to the requirements of this 
article where downstream damage potential is demonstrated to be nominal or insignificant or 
where the special exception is in the best interest of the city, having due regard to the property 
rights of the owners of affected property and the general health, safety and welfare of the city. 
1. i believe this development puts more damage downstream to our shady shores rd. 
which is a cross through street. They will not be able to use storm drains since so close to 
water levels already. (d) The subdivider or developer shall pay for the cost of all drainage 
improvements required for the development of the subdivision or construction of the proposed 
improvements, including any necessary off-site channels or storm sewers and acquisition of 
the required easements. 1. At the last meeting the speaker said we cannot ask the 
development for money to improve the drainage issues and streets. Yet it says the 
developer shall pay for the cost of all drainage improvements required, including any 
necessary off-site channels or storm sewers and acquisition of the required easements. 
Which mean if roads need tore up to install the correct drainage, they need they shall 
pay. There in no need to wait for Denton county and the shady shores project the 
developer should pay to add all these ppl (e) 1.Where it is anticipated that additional runoff 
incidental to the development of a subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage 
facility or system, whether natural or manmade, the planning and zoning commission may 
withhold approval of the subdivision plat, whether preliminary or final, until improvements, 
including storm sewer systems, channel grading, driveway adjustments, culvert improvements, 
etc., are first approved. No development, construction or building permit shall be issued until 
the approved drainage improvements are first constructed. SHADY SHORES RD RUNOFF 
IS VERY CERTAIN IT CAN NOT HOLD THE EXTRA RUN OFF (1) In areas where 
existing downstream drainage facilities or systems are inadequate to handle anticipated 
increased flows, the city as one alternative may consider accepting monetary payment in lieu 
of actual drainage improvements. The monetary amount must be in an amount which is 
reasonably expected to reimburse the city for its anticipated costs in constructing the necessary 
downstream drainage improvements. LETS PROTECT The city and put this in affect if 
they do not plan to pay for it upfront. (3) Where previously subdivided or platted property 
is considered for development or improvement, applications for development, construction or 
building permits may be denied by the city where downstream improvements are required but 
none are made or proposed. In the event of such denial, the applicant's sole remedy shall be an 
appeal to the city council, which shall conduct a hearing on the appeal. The decision of the city 
Page 6 of 11 
 
council shall be final. The council shall have the authority in such cases to grant special 
exceptions to the requirements of this section where downstream damage potential is 
demonstrated to be nominal or insignificant or where the special exception is in the best interest 
of the city, having due regard to the property rights of the owners of affected property and the 
general health, safety and welfare of the city.(Ordinance 26, § 7(C), 1967; Ordinance 26-A, § 
2, 1986; Code 1989, § 17.24.130; Ordinance 99-01, § 2(17.24.130), 1-14-99) I THINK 
SHADY SHORES IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF 
OUR CITY LEADERS. WITH ONE WAY IN AND ONE WAY OUT FOR OVER A 
THOUSAND PPL WHO MUST USE THIS ROUTE BECAUSE OF FLOOD WATER IS 
NOT SAFE OR REASONABLE TO WAIT FOR THE SHADY SHORES ROAD PROJECT 
WHEN WE CAN HAVE THIS DEVELOPMENT FIX AT LEAST THE LAKE DALLAS 
ISSUE OF FLOODING OF SHADY SHORES. (a) I BELIEVE A MORE VISUAL 
DESIGN NEEDED BEFORE DEVELOPMENT IS LOOKED AT. I ALOS BELIEVE A 
CITY MANAGER NEEDS TO LOOK AT ALL DRAINAGE ISSUES AND NEED TO 
MAKE 
SUGGESTIONS 
ON 
THE 
IMPROVEMENTS 
BEFORE 
ANY 
CONSTRUCTION IS ALLOWED (b) (c) The applicant shall dedicate an appropriate 
drainage easement either in fee or by drainage easement or by conservation easement of land 
on both sides of existing watercourses to a distance to be determined by the planning and 
zoning commission. THE Development IS IN CHARGE OF THE COST TO PROVIDE 
THE CORRECT DRAINAGE NOT THE RESIDENT. (Ordinance 26, § 7(D), 1967; 
Ordinance 26-A, § 2, 1986; Code 1989, § 17.24.140; Ordinance 99-01, § 3(17.24.140), 1-14-
99) This development as is, is not considered in the best interest of the city residents. I 
would like to see the improvements they plan to make to the drainage issues we all deal 
with in thousand oaks developments and the city of lake dallas especially when the roads 
flood. It clearly states that the development must either put in Sec. 94-164. - Drainage 
easements. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the 
inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements 
for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines and with 
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat or on a topographical 
diagram submitted in support of the application for development, construction or building 
permit. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or to other 
drainage facilities. When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land 
outside the subdivision or outside the boundary of the property to be developed, appropriate 
drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat or other instrument as approved by 
the city attorney. In the case of clear public interest, the city may participate in easement 
acquisition by power of condemnation. DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHTS FOR DRAINAGE 
NOT SURE IF ITS APPLICABLE IN THIS SITUATION? appropriate drainage easement 
where needed such along the back of my house or they need to pay for the invoice to have 
my drainage corrected and drained to the street. If not, we will end up with standing 
water which because a cesspool for mosquitoes and other harmful mater. (a) (b) (c) The 
minimum width of a street shall be 50 feet; the minimum gradient shall be four-tenths of one 
Page 7 of 11 
 
percent and the maximum gradient shall be ten percent. (Ordinance 26, § 7, 1967; Code 1989, 
§ 17.20.020) I went to get an awning added to my house recently yet the builder said I had a 
6.5ft build line. I wanted to take the awning to my property line but looks like I will be denied. 
If I have a 6.5 ft build line Sec. 94-112. - Street design. For the purpose of facilitating the 
movement of traffic, certain streets are designated by the city plan as thoroughfares. A map 
showing these thoroughfares will be on file in the office of the city planning and zoning 
commission, and reference shall be made to this system of streets before any preliminary plan 
is approved. NO PLANS ON HOW THEY WILL BRING TOGETHER THE 
DEVELOPMENT ENTRACE AND LAKE SHORE WHICH IS A thoroughfare ROAD. 
NO REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE TO THIS BY THE DEVOLPMENT. IT 
ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE NOT LEFT ANY ROOM FOR LAKE SORE 
TO WIDEN. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OVER ALL PLANS OF HOW THEY 
PLAN TO INTERCEPT LAKE SHORE BEFORE WE ALLOW THEM TO BUILD 
OUT TO THE CURRENT LAKE SHORE. When a proposed subdivision abuts a major 
street, or is bounded by a line that will in the future lie in a major street, as shown on the city 
plan, the owner of that subdivision shall dedicate, without charge, any land within such 
subdivision that is necessary to provide conformity with the city plan, such dedication to be 
shown on the preliminary plan and final plat. This shall also apply when such subdivision is 
divided by a major street. LETS SEE THE CITY PLAN AND HOW THEY PLAN TO BE 
THE FIRST OF MANY INTERSECTIONS ON OUR NEW LAKE SHORE ROAD. this puts 
minimum 32 feet between our houses so that makes it at least 19 feet between any permeant 
structure. Which The development wanted to put the house at first 5 feet apart how ridiculous 
which I believe we made it to ten feet as a request now when it should really fall in suite with 
existing structures with a minimum of 19 feet between homes. I’m not sure why we would go 
away from city ordinance and allow new homes to be different from the neighborhoods that 
have been here. It's seems to me that city look a lot nicer if they continue on the same trend 
and not allow all these little homes and subzero lots. It's going to make the city look ridiculous 
driving down the same street seeing zero lot houses compared to the original housing of lake 
Dallas. 
 
Rick Allen stated that his property abuts this property.  He stated that he was concern about 
the trees on his property being cut down.  He also stated that he was concerned about the pad 
elevation.  
 
Jane Boyd stated that she was speaking on behalf of Don Lee of 409 S Shady Shore Rd. She 
stated that are concerned about the   increase of water onto their property which is directly 
across from this property.  Ms. Boyd stated she was concerned about the increase in traffic on 
Shady Shores Road which was already a busy road. She asked if there would be a limit on how 
many cars would be allowed for each resident. She asked if this would increase the water and 
wastewater rates?

Interlocal Cooperative Purchasing Agreement  
 
DESCRIPTION: 
 
Consider and Act on a Resolution approving the Interlocal Cooperative Purchasing Agreement 
between the City of Lake Dallas and Denton County, Texas. 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
 
The City of Lake Dallas entered into a Interlocal Cooperative Purchasing (“ICA”) with Denton County in 
1998.  The Interlocal Cooperation Act, V.T.C.A. Government Code, Chapter 791, allows the City to 
enter into joint contracts and agreements for the performance of governmental functions and 
services including administrative functions normally associated with the operation of government 
such as purchasing of necessary materials and supplies.  Since the current ICA is over 20 years old, 
the County would like to update the current agreement.  This ICA would give the City other options 
to purchase equipment, supplies, etc. without going thru the bid process.   
 
 FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION: 
 
RECOMMENDED MOTIONS: 
 
I move to approve/deny authorize Resolution approving the Interlocal Cooperative Purchasing 
Agreement between the City of Lake Dallas and Denton County, Texas.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
 
Mr. John Glover is seeking to enter into an agreement with the City of Lake Dallas to provide 
Environmental Health Inspections and related professional services for the City of Lake Dallas. 
Mr. Glover has provided health services to the City of Lake Dallas for several years and his current 
contract expires on June 14, 2020. The proposed agreement would begin on June 15, 2020 
running through September 30, 2021 and renew automatically for up to three (3) years after that 
on an annual basis. Renewal periods would run from October 1 through September 30 to be in 
line with the City of Lake Dallas Fiscal Calendar.  
 
The role of the health inspector is to ensure local food establishments are complaint with Texas 
Food Establishment Rules as well as Chapter 54-Health and Sanitation of the Lake Dallas Code of 
Ordinances. The City of Lake Dallas Code of Ordinances states the health authority of the city and 
the authority's appointed representative may at any reasonable hour enter any building or 
premises for the purposes of making an inspection or investigation which, under the provisions 
of this article, such official may deem necessary to be made in order to assure the health, safety 
and well-being of the citizens of the city (Sec. 54-32). Sec. 54-32 (b) gives the health inspector the 
authority to cite establishments not in compliance with State and City requirements.  
 
Mr. Glover’s services provided to the City of Lake Dallas shall consist of the following:  
 
• Food establishment inspections: scheduled inspections 1 time every 6 months or at a 
frequency authorized by the City of Lake Dallas. Inspection fee shall be $70.00 per facility. 
Inspections shall confirm compliance with State food establishment rules and City of Lake 
Dallas Ordinances. 
• Pre-opening inspections: preopening inspections shall be $70.00 per inspection. 
• Special Events: Inspections of temporary food establishments, authorized by the City 
Manager or his/her designee. Inspection fees shall be $15.00 per facility.  
• Swimming Pools: scheduled inspections of public/semi-public swimming pools shall be 1 
time per year or more frequently upon authorization by the City Manager or his/her 
designee. Inspection fees shall be $70.00 per swimming pool.  
• Enforcement: enforcement of violations of the Texas Food Establishment Rules or the City 
of Lake Dallas Code of Ordinances. The contractor shall collect all evidence in accordance 
with the Texas Code of Criminal Procedures and shall file charges in the City of Lake Dallas 
Municipal Court when authorized by the City Manager or his/her designee. The fee 
charged to the City of Lake Dallas for filing a charge with the City of Lake Dallas Municipal 
Court shall be $70.00 per charge/offense. 
• Complaint investigations: food establishment complaint investigations shall be 
authorized by the City of Lake Dallas. Investigation fee shall be $70.00 per complaint and 
shall be invoiced to the City of Lake Dallas. 
• Food establishment plan review: plan review shall be $75.00 per plan review and 
performed to ensure compliance with State food establishment rules/City of Lake Dallas 
Code of Ordinances.  
 
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION: 
 
There is no financial impact to the taxpayers of the City of Lake Dallas. Section 54-33 (f) of the 
Code of Ordinances states all required inspections are subject to a fee consistent with the amount 
charged to the city to have the inspection performed. The affected individual business will be 
billed an amount equal to the inspection fee. 
 
Recommended Motion:  
 
I make a motion to approve/deny a Resolution authorizing the City Manager to negotiate 
services and enter into a Professional Services Agreement with Mr. John Glover for the 
performance of Environmental Health Inspections and related services.

AGENDA ITEM 6 
CITY COUNCIL 
AGENDA MEMO 
Prepared By: Angie Manglaris, Director of Development Services     June 11, 2020         
Conduct a public hearing and consider an Ordinance changing the zoning relating to the 
development and use of 6.767± acres out of the N. French Survey Abstract  No. 424 from C-1 
Retail and C-3-Commercial to PD Planned Development for R-1 Single Family to allow for 
approximately 50 single family dwellings on approximately 6.8 acres.  The property is more 
commonly known as 301 Carlisle Drive.  (Case Z-2020-03) 
 
DESCRIPTION:  
Conduct a public hearing and take appropriate action on a request to adopt an ordinance 
changing the zoning for 6.767 acres of land described as a portion of the N. French Survey 
Abstract A-424 from C-1 Retail and C-3-Commercial to R-1-PD Single Family Planned 
Development to allow for approximately 50 single family dwellings on approximately 6.8 acres.  
The property is more commonly known as 301 Carlisle Drive.   
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
Ms. Marykay Smith (“Applicant”) has applied to rezone Lots 2-A and 3-A, Gatlin Addition, a 
combined 6.767-acre parcel near the corner of Carlisle Drive and the DART/DCTA rail corridor.  It 
is staff’s understanding that Ms. Smith is the owner of the property and wishes to develop the 
property with the intent of constructing approximately 50 single family homes on 2,900 square 
foot lots.     
 
The proposal is to construct a single-family residential subdivision with smaller lots to create a 
walkable neighborhood.  The area regulations proposed are: 
 
 
Existing R-1-6000 standards 
Proposed PD regulations 
Front yard 
25 feet 
15 feet 
Side yards 
5 feet 
2.5 feet (P&Z 
recommended 5’) 
Rear yards 
30 feet 
15 feet 
Lot Width 
50 feet 
40 feet 
Lot Depth 
90 feet 
72 feet 
Lot Area: 
6,000 square feet 
2,900 square feet 
Minimum dwelling size 
1,200 square feet 
800 square feet 
 
The intent is to build pre-World War 2 housing types and styles.  Staff recommends that an 
architectural control committee be included in a set of deed restrictions, since the State 
legislature has limited a city’s ability to enforce building materials and aesthetic regulations. Two 
stormwater detention ponds are proposed which may have park-like amenities and a connection 
to the DCTA Rail trail is planned. 
 
A PD ordinance is a negotiated set of regulations where the developer gets some flexibility in 
development standards in exchange for higher development standards and/or additional public 
amenities.  The City Council will need to make a determination whether the public interest is 
served by the proposed development. 
 
CONFORMANCE WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 
 
The recently-adopted Lake Dallas Vision 2030 Comprehensive Plan shows the property as a 
combination of “single family residential”, which is intended for residential detached 
developments that generally range between 0.5 and 7 dwelling units per acre, and “Mixed-Use 
Development”, which is intended to include a mixture of uses (vertically or horizontally) including 
residential, retail, commercial and office uses in a walkable setting.  
 
ADJACENT ZONING AND LAND USE: 
 
The existing zoning on the subject property is C-1 Retail and C-3 Commercial.  The zoning and 
existing land use on the subject property and adjacent property is as follows: 
 
 
PLANNING ANALYSIS 
 
Land Use:   
 
While the proposed project does not provide true mixed use and has a proposed density (8.5 
units per acre) greater than the general range for single family (0.5 to 7 units per acre), the project 
does provide a housing type that could be compatible with a mixed use walkable community. 
Although the project is adjacent to some commercial uses and the DART/DCTA rail corridor, Staff 
concurs that the property is not conducive to retail uses. Any potential conflicts with adjacent 
land uses can be mitigated through design and buffers.

The project is not large enough to require a traffic impact analysis.  Although the Lake Cities Fire 
Department has indicated that they may be able to serve a subdivision of up to 75 lots with a 
single point of entry, staff believes that it is prudent to require two points of access for any 
subdivision with 20 or more lots.  The applicant has proposed a street stub to the northeast that 
would satisfy this requirement in the future. 
 
Drainage 
 
The property has a slight ridgeline that runs from northwest to southeast, so the northeast 
portion of the property drains to the northeast and the southwest portion of the property drains 
to the southwest.  A fair amount of fill has been placed on the property which may alter the 
drainage patterns. The 100-year floodplain does not appear to affect this property.  Any on-site 
drainage will be addressed during platting and site plan review. 
 
Regulatory Issues 
 
The applicant is proposing to rezone two legally-platted lots.    The Applicant has submitted a 
concept plan, but it appears that they prefer to tie their PD ordinance to a set of regulations 
rather than a specific site plan.  The concept plan would be revised during the platting process.  
 
The property will need to be platted in accordance with the Subdivision Ordinance and a final 
plat approved before any construction or building permits can be issued. 
 
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION: The proposed development, when built out, would generate 
additional property and sales taxes.  It would also require additional costs in police, fire and other 
city services.  The City has not made a detailed fiscal assessment of the impact of the 
development. 
PLANNING AND ZONING MUNUTES OF FEBRUARY 20, 2020 
6. Change the zoning for 6.767 acres of land described as Lots 2-A and 3-A, Gatlin Addition, 
from C-1 retail and C- Commercial to R-PD-Planned Development District to allow the 
construction of 55 single family lots on 2.9 SF minimum lots.  The Property is more generally 
known as 301 Carlisle Drive.  The applicant is Marykay Smith.     
John Cabrales introduced Marykay Smith as the (Applicant) for her presentation on the 
proposed zoning change.  She presented the following features of her proposed project: 
• Proposed Front Yard setback of fifteen (15) feet with allowable ten (10) feet 
encroachment for front porches; however, greater depths shall be permitted at the 
discretion of the developer or homebuilder.   
• Side Yard – The minimum distance from any side building line to a property line at any 
point shall not be less two-and-one-half (2.5) feet, except on a corner lot where such 
distance shall not be less than five (5) feet. 
• Rear Yard – There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than ten (10) feet; 
however, greater depths shall be permitted at the discretion of the developer or 
homebuilder.  
• Width of Lot – The minimum width of the lot shall be forty (40) feet at the building line 
for all lots. 
• Depth of Lot – The minimum lot depth shall be not less than seventy-two (72) feet at the 
average distance between the front and rear lot lines. 
• Area of lot – Every lot shall have an area of not less than twenty-eight hundred (2800) 
square feet. The minimum floor area of the main building shall not be in the aggregate 
less than eight-hundred square feet (800 SF) exclusive of porches, garages, and accessory 
buildings. 
• Other Area Regulations shall be found in the Ordinance. 
John Cabrales told the Commission that Ms. Smith has applied to rezone Lots 2-A and 3-A, 
Gatlin Addition, a combined 6.767-acre tract near the corner of Carlisle Dr and the DCTA A-
line.  It is staff’s understanding that Ms. Smith is the owner of the property and wishes to 
develop the property with the intent of constructing approximately 50 single family homes 
on 29,000-square-foot lots. 
 
Public hearing opened at 8:35. 
Chris Gordon, Adam Oeabody, Olga Chernomvets and Stan Lovelace expressed their 
concerns regarding the increase of traffic on Carlisle and the zoning changes.  
 
Public hearing closed at 9:00 pm.  
 
The Commission discussed the drainage, traffic study, and the development  
Motion:  Melody Parlett moved to approve the proposed rezoning as presented subject to: 
• Development of a more detailed set of development regulations to allow preparation of 
a PD Ordinance including five-foot (5 ft.) sidewalks, a traffic study, a drainage study, 
increase the side yard setbacks to five feet (5ft.) and with an additional point of ingress 
and egress. Lester Rayburn second the motion.  Motion carried.    
 
Ayes: Ben Gilbert, Melody Parlett, John Moore, Lester Rayburn, Jayme Potter  
 
Nays: None 
PROJECT UPDATE:  
Since the February 20, 2020, Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, the applicant has worked 
with City staff to provide additional development regulations and information for the preparation 
of a Planned Development Ordinance. The proposed PD includes requirements to provide a 
street stub at the northeast portion of the project for future street connections, requirements to 
construct five-foot (5’) sidewalks connecting to the DCTA trail, revises the side yard side yard 
setback to five feet (5’), and provides additional architectural requirements for the development.  
Mr. Lee Williams, City Engineer, has reviewed the proposed development and has determined 
the project does not reach the threshold require a traffic impact analysis (TIA) per the Engineering 
Manual. The email from Mr. Williams is included in the packet for reference.   
A full drainage study and plans are be required at the time of plat and construction plan review.  
RECOMMENDED MOTION: 
City staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission recommend the following motion: 
I move to adopt an Ordinance to rezone 6.767 acres of land described as a portion of the N. 
French Survey Abstract No. 424 from C-1 Retail and C-3-Commercial to PD Planned Development 
for R-1 Single Family uses.

Email from City Engineer, 18 May 2020 
 
John, 
 
This development does not reach the threshold to require a TIA per the Engineering Manual. The 
manual requires a TIA for several situations. These two are most applicable, and neither one would 
require a TIA: 
 
1. Zoning – These TIA requirements shall apply to all zoning requests for land uses which will 
generate 2,000 or more vehicle trips per day or contain a density of 0.75 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) 
or greater. Applicable requests include zoning requests and Thoroughfare Plan amendments, if 
no previous traffic assessment was performed. Special circumstances  including, but not limited 
to, development with no case history, which do not meet the daily trip generation threshold, may 
also require a TIA. Such circumstances, as determined by the City Engineer may include, but are 
not limited to, impacts to residential neighborhoods from  non-residential development, 
inadequate site accessibility, the implementation of the surrounding Thoroughfare Plan is not 
anticipated during the estimated time period of the proposed development, the proposed land 
use differs significantly from that contemplated in the Comprehensive Plan, or the internal street 
or access is not anticipated to accommodate the expected traffic generation. 
 
This is a residential development that should generate about 500 trips per day (generally about 
9-10 trips per house is the calculation for single family development). I don’t believe any of the 
other special circumstances apply, as there doesn’t seem to be an accessibility issue and Carlisle 
should be able to handle the increased traffic. The site is currently zoned commercial and is 
changing to residential. Commercial zoning would have higher trip generation than residential. 
The lowest trip generation rate in commercial land uses is about 12 trips per 1,000 square feet 
for office space. Converting to residential will have the long-term effect of lowering the 
projection for traffic on Carlisle when all is built-out.  
 
2. Development – These TIA requirements shall apply to all development requests for land uses, 
except single-family residential development, which will generate over 100 total trips during the 
AM or PM peak hour. 
 
This is single-family residential, and the peak hour trip generation for 500 vehicles per day would 
be about 50 vehicles per hour in the peak hours.  
 
I can understand the concern about additional traffic on Carlisle, but the main effect of having that 
acreage in residential versus commercial is that the long-term effect on traffic will be less. For some 
perspective, this development would be expected to produce an additional 500 vehicles per day. If all of 
that traffic were to use Carlisle (that would be spread out more if there is a second ingress/egress 
point), that would add about 50 vehicles per hour in the busiest hours, which translates to about 1 
vehicle per minute. Even with this increase, the traffic on Carlisle is well below capacity. The intersection 
at Lake Dallas Drive will have more stress, but the all-way stop will help alleviate the issues on Carlisle, 
as it will give those vehicles a chance to turn onto Lake Dallas. 
 
I hope this helps, and let me know if you need anything else or have any questions. 
 
Thanks, 
Lee

AGENDA ITEM 7  
CITY COUNCIL  
AGENDA MEMO 
Prepared By: Angie Manglaris, Director of Development Services       
JUNE 11, 2020 
Conduct a public hearing and consider an Ordinance changing the zoning regulations governing 
the development and use of 0.51± acres out of the Mary Wright Survey, Abstract No. 1355, said 
property being located in the Downtown District, from C-1 Retail District and C-3 Commercial 
District to Planned Development (PD) for C-3 Commercial District and adding laundromats as a 
permitted use.  The property is more commonly known as 312 S. Shady Shores Drive.  (Case Z-
2020-05) 
 
DESCRIPTION:  
 
Conduct a public hearing and take appropriate action on a request to adopt an ordinance rezoning a 
0.051± acre tract out of the Mary Wright Survey, Abstract No. 1355 located in the Downtown District from 
C1 Retail District and C3 Commercial  Planned Development for C-3 Commercial District and adding 
laundromats as a permitted use.  The property is more commonly known as 312 S. Shady Shores Drive.   
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
 
1. 
The request is to revise the zoning for the property at 312 S. Shady Shores to clean up the current 
split zoning and to add authorize the property to be used and developed as a laundromat, which 
is presently a prohibited use in the overlay zoning district known as the “Downtown District”.  The 
northern one-third of the property is presently zoned C1 Retail and the remainder is zoned C3-
Commercial  A laundromat is a permitted use in both the C1 and C3 Zoning Districts, but is listed 
as a prohibited use in the Downtown District. 
  
2. 
There is an existing structure on the property with Liberation Coffee and Shear Design Salon as 
current tenants. A car wash is located to the north, a residence to the east, a fast-food restaurant 
(Sonic) is located to the south, and the DCTA rail line is to the west across S. Shady Shores Drive.  
CONFORMANCE WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 
 
The recently-adopted Lake Dallas Vision 2030 Comprehensive Plan shows the property as well as the 
surrounding property.  as “Downtown Mixed Use”. The Downtown Mixed Use category is meant to include 
horizontal and vertical mix of uses including residential, retail, institutional and office with secondary uses 
of lifestyle residential and associated supporting uses.  One could argue that a laundromat is a support 
use for residential.  It is not clear whether the propose rezoning conforms to the Comprehensive Plan. 
 
ADJACENT ZONING AND LAND USE: 
 
The existing zoning on the subject property is C1 Retail and C3 Commercial, subject to the Downtown 
District overlay zoning regulations.   
 
2 
 
 
PLANNING ANALYSIS 
 
Conformance with Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances 
 
1. 
The lot is split-zoned and should be rezoned to all one use or the other.  Since the majority 
of the lot is zoned C3-Commercial subject to the Downtown District overlay, staff 
recommends rezoning to the base C3 Commercial district. 
 
2. 
While both the C1 Retail and C3 Commercial districts allow laundromats, the Downtown 
District overlay regulations specifically prohibits laundromats as a permitted use.  Since 
the current staff is not aware of the rationale for prohibiting laundromats from the 
Downtown District overlay zone, we have no opinion about the merits of the request. 
 
3. 
The property is unplatted.  Since no new construction is proposed, there is no need to 
plat the property at this time. 
 
Land Use:   
 
The proposed use will be located within an existing commercial building.  There may be slightly increased 
noise, but otherwise should have no adverse effects on adjacent property.  Many problems associated 
with laundromats result from inadequate onsite management, so the Council may want to inquire about 
whether onsite personnel will be present and clarify the proposed operating hours. 
 
Traffic 
 
There should be no appreciable effect on traffic on S. Shady Shores over any other allowed commercial 
use. 
 
Drainage 
 
Drainage generally flows from east to west toward S. Shady Shores Drive and a drainage channel between 
S. Shady Shores Drive and the DCTA rail line. Since the proposed use will be in an existing building, there 
will be no change in runoff.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION:

UNAPPROVED P&Z MINUTES FROM MAY 21, 2020 
6. Change the zoning for 0.53 acres of land described as tract 15 of the Wright Survey A-1355A, 
from C1-DD Commercial with Downtown Overlay and C3-DD Commercial with Downtown 
Overlay to C3-PD Commercial Planned Development to allow the installation of a laundromat. 
The Property is more generally known as 312 S. Shady Shores. The applicants are Chris and 
Jessica Haney.  (Case Z-2020-05) [PUBLIC HEARING] 
 
Mr. Chris Haney, applicant, presented his project to the Commission and explained his interest in 
the changing of the zoning of the 0.53 acres of land described as tract 15 of the Wright Survey A-
1355A.  
Mr. Dave Gattis presented the staff memo to the Commission and gave an overview of the project. 
Mr. Gattis explained the reason for the zoning request at 312 S. Shady Shores is to clean up the 
current split zoning that exists on the property and to create a Planned Development to a allow a 
laundromat at the location as is a prohibited use in the Downtown overlay District. The northern 
one-third of the property is zoned C1-DD Commercial with Downtown overlay and the remainder 
is zoned C3-DD.  A laundromat is a permitted use in both the C1 and C3 Districts but is listed as a 
prohibited use in the Downtown overlay. 
The Comprehensive Plan shows the property as “Downtown Mixed Use”,” as well as the 
surrounding property.  It is not clear whether the propose rezoning conforms to the 
Comprehensive Plan.  The Staff prefers rezoning to the base C3 district. 
The public hearing opened at 7:38 pm.  
Glen Verba, 202 Julian Street, Lake Dallas, TX 75065, spoke in favor of the zoning change.  
John Moore asked what type of security will be on site. Chris Haney responded cameras and 
can/will be monitored by phone at all times.  
The public hearing closed at 7:41 pm.  
Melody Parlett asked for clarification between C-1 and C-3.  Mr. Gattis read different types of 
businesses allowed in C-3 verses C-1. 
John Cabrales, City Manager, spoke on type of businesses the City envisioned as part of the Lake 
Dallas downtown area.   
 
Motion   Melody Parlett moved to recommend that City Council approve the proposed rezoning of Tract 
15 to C3-PD to specifically allow a laundromat.    
 
John Moore seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously by a vote of three (3) in favor to none 
(0) opposed.   
RECOMMENDED MOTION: 
4 
 
City staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission recommend the following motion:  
I move to adopt an Ordinance to rezone 0.51± acres out of the Mary Wright Survey, Abstract No.-1355 
located in the Downtown District from C1-Retail  and C3 Commercial Planned Development for C-3 
Commercial and adding laundromats as a permitted use.

CITY COUNCIL 
AGENDA MEMO 
Prepared By: Angie Manglaris, Director of Development Services       
June 11, 2020 
Conduct a public hearing and take appropriate action on a request to replat Lots 1-6 and Lots 
11-16, Block 1, Lake Dallas Sites into two larger lots, including vacation of a portion of street 
right-of-way for Carrollton Street The property is more commonly known as 112 N. Lakeview 
Drive.  (Case P2020-01) 
 
DESCRIPTION:  
Conduct a public hearing and take appropriate action on a request to replat Lots 1-6 and Lots 11-16, Block 
1, Lake Dallas Sites into two larger lots.  The replat includes the vacation of a portion of street right-of-
way for Carrollton Street adjacent to Lots 11-16, Block 1, Lake Dallas Sites.  A portion of Carrollton Street 
previously was vacated in 2012.  The property is more commonly known as 112 N. Lakeview Drive.  (Case 
P2020-01).  The owner/applicant is Samuel Montalvo and the property is zoned R-1-6000 Single Family 
Residential. 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
Mr. Samuel Montalvo (“Applicant”) has applied to replat six existing platted lots, plus a portion of street 
right-of-way for Carrollton Street, into two larger lots encompassing approximately 0.3 acres at the 
northeast corner of N. Lakeview Drive and Mosely Street.  There is a single-family house on the proposed 
southern lot.  As part of the replat, Mr. Montalvo has requested the City vacate and abandon eight feet 
of width of Carrollton Street at the rear of the new lots in exchange for dedicating approximately 3.6 feet 
of additional right-of-way along North Lakeview Drive.  
 
CONFORMANCE WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 
 
The recently-adopted Lake Dallas Vision 2030 Comprehensive Plan shows the property as “Single Family 
Residential”, as well as the surrounding property.  The proposed replat conforms to the Comprehensive 
Plan. 
 
ADJACENT ZONING AND LAND USE: 
 
The existing zoning on the subject property is R-1-6000 Single Family Residential.

Conformance with Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances 
 
• 
The property is zoned R-1-6000 single family.  Each of the proposed lots exceeds the minimum 
size lot required in the zoning district.  It is unclear whether the required zoning setbacks will be 
maintained for the existing residence with the replat.  The applicant’s surveyor was requested to 
provide an exhibit that showed the footprint of existing structures and their setback from 
proposed property lines, to verify that no encroachments into the required front, side or rear 
yards were created by the plat, but none was provided. 
 
• 
The plat proposes to vacate an eight-foot wide portion of Carrollton Street on the east side, and 
to dedicate an additional 3.64 feet of right-of-way for North Lakeview Drive along the west side.  
The existing right-of-way width of North Lakeview Drive is approximately 37.96 feet and would be 
only 41.6 feet wide with the proposed ROW dedication.  Section 94-112(c) of the Subdivision 
Ordinance requires that all streets be 50 feet wide.  Therefore, the minimum right-of-way 
dedication along the west side should be six feet (6’), or one-half of the deficiency.  The right-of-
way for Mosely Street is also substandard, so a minimum of five feet (5’) of right-of-way should 
be dedicated. 
 
The applicant notes a five-foot strip of land was dedicated for roadway along the west side of 
North Lakeview Drive a couple of years ago and the corner clip was also established at that time. 
Right-of-way was not dedicated from the east side at that time. The applicant is proposing to 
dedicate 3.6 feet on the east side of the street to match the corner clip that was dedicated 
previously. Mosely Street right-of-way was matched up to the south line of the replat of Lake 
Dallas Sites to the east which was approved in 2013. 
 
• 
The name of the surveyor should be added to the listing in the lower right-hand corner to comply 
with Sec. 94-71(1) of the Subdivision Ordinance. 
 
• 
Front building setback lines should be added along North Lakeview Drive and Mosely Street to 
comply with Sec. 94-71(5) of the Subdivision Ordinance. 
 
• 
Staff is concerned about Note 1 at the bottom center, which states that a title search has not been 
conducted.  Staff recommends that the applicant verify that all recorded easements that affect 
these properties are shown on the face of the plat. 
 
Land Use:   
 
The proposed replat has no significant effect on land use.  It has the minor benefit of reducing the overall 
density by combining existing platted lots. 
 
Traffic 
 
1. There is no appreciable effect on traffic on N. Lakeview Drive or Mosely Street. 
 
2. The vacation of the southern 150 feet of right-of-way of Carrollton street results in a remaining 
50-foot section of Carrollton street ROW to the north with no access.  It would be preferable to 
vacate this remaining portion of Carrollton Street to the adjoining property owner of Lots 7, 8, 9 
and 10 (Dennis Craig, owner) so that the City does not end up with a land-locked piece of right-
of-way. 
 
The applicants state the Craig property has access to North Lakeview Drive and the Carrollton 
Street right-of-way should not be an issue that affects this tract. The applicant states that if the 
Craigs ever replat they would acquire the remnant of the abandoned street at that time. 
 
Drainage 
 
Drainage generally flows from west to east, with less than two-foot of fall over 90 feet.  The drainage 
sheet flows onto the adjoining residential lots to the east.  There does not appear to be any need for 
additional drainage improvements. 
 
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION:  
The proposed development would have minimal effect on City costs and revenues.  If additional street 
right-of-way needs to be acquired, then the taxpayers would need to pay fair market value for the 
additional right-of-way if not donated. 
UNAPPROVED P&Z MINUTES FROM MAY 21, 2020 
5.  Consider and make a recommendation on a request to replat of Lots 1-6 and 11-16, Block 1, 
Lake Dallas Sites into two larger lots.  The replat includes the vacation of a portion of Carrollton Street.  
The Property is more commonly known as 112 N. Lakeview Drive. (Case P-2020-01) 
Mr. Jerald Yensan of Landmark Surveying, a representative of the applicant, gave a presentation to the 
Commission regarding the proposed replat. Mr. Yensan explained the purpose of the replat was to 
combine Lots 1-6 and Lots 11-16, Block 1, Lake Dallas Sites into two larger lots vacation of a portion of 
street right-of-way for Carrollton Street adjacent to lots 11-16, Block 1 Lake Dallas Sites.   
Mr. Dave Gattis presented a slide presentation and gave an overview of the proposed replat to the 
Commission. Mr. Gattis explained there were several items the plat was deficient in and the Commission 
needed to consider as part of their discussion including: 
• 
The property is zoned R-1-6000 single family.  Each of the proposed lots exceeds the minimum 
size lot required in the zoning district.  It is unclear whether the required zoning setbacks will be 
maintained for the existing residence with the replat.  The applicant’s surveyor was requested to 
provide an exhibit that showed the footprint of existing structures and their setback from 
proposed property lines, to verify that no encroachments into the required front, side or rear 
yards were created by the plat, but none was provided. 
 
• 
The plat proposes to vacate an eight-foot wide portion of Carrollton Street on the east side, and 
to dedicate an additional 3.64 feet of right-of-way for North Lakeview Drive along the west side.  
The existing right-of-way width of North Lakeview Drive is approximately 37.96 feet and would be 
only 41.6 feet wide with the proposed ROW dedication.  Section 94-112(c) of the Subdivision 
Ordinance requires that all streets be 50 feet wide.  Therefore, the minimum right-of-way 
dedication along the west side should be six feet (6’), or one-half of the deficiency.  The right-of-
way for Mosely Street is also substandard, so a minimum of five feet (5’) of right-of-way should 
be dedicated. 
 
• 
The name of the surveyor should be added to the listing in the lower right-hand corner to comply 
with Sec. 94-71(1) of the Subdivision Ordinance. 
 
• 
Front building setback lines should be added along North Lakeview Drive and Mosely Street to 
comply with Sec. 94-71(5) of the Subdivision Ordinance. 
 
• 
Staff is concerned about Note 1 at the bottom center, which states that a title search has not been 
conducted.  Staff recommends that the applicant verify that all recorded easements that affect 
these properties are shown on the face of the plat. 
 
Public hearing opened at 7:14 pm. No public input was received. The public hearing closed at 7:15 
pm.  
Discussion was held amongst the Commission regarding the staff recommendations about right-of-
way dedication and what future right-of-way could be used for. Mr. Gattis explained the 
recommendation was based on the Code of Ordinances and minimum right-of-way requirements. Mr. 
Gattis further explained right-of-way could be used for public improvements such as the installation 
of sidewalks.  
Motion   Melody Parlett moved to approve the proposed replat of Lots 1-6 and Lots 11-16, Block 1, 
Lake Dallas Sites subject to the following conditions:  
1. The applicant provides verification that the proposed replat will not result in any 
encroachment by existing buildings, and address housekeeping items as discussed in the 
including: the applicant provide setback lines along Lakeview Drive and Mosley; and the 
applicant shall name of the surveyor to the plat; 
2. The applicant shall dedicate six feet (6’) of right-of way on North Lakeview Drive; and 
3. The applicant shall dedicate five feet (5’) of right-of-way on Mosley Street. 
 
John Moore seconded the motion. The motion carried unanimously by a vote of three (3) in favor to     
none (0) opposed.  
 
Project Update:  
The applicant has submitted a revised replat for consideration to reflect conditions stipulated 
by the Planning and Zoning Commission at their May 21, 2020 meeting. The revised replat 
provides the following: 
1. Six feet (6’) of right-of-way has been dedicated along N. Lakeview Drive and five feet (5’) of 
right-of-way has been dedicated along Mosely Street to comply with Section 94-112 (c) of the 
Subdivision Ordinance; 
 
2. The name of the surveyor has been added to the listing in the lower right-hand corner to 
comply with Section 94-71 (1) of the Subdivision Ordinance; 
 
3. The building setback lines along North Lakeview Drive and Mosely Street have been added 
to comply with Section 94-71 (5) of the Subdivision Ordinance; and 
 
4. The applicant has verified that all recorded easements that affect these properties are 
shown on the face of the plat to comply with Section 94-71 (5) of the Subdivision Ordinance. 
The proposed replat is compliant with the City of Lake Dallas Code of Ordinances and is 
ready for approval.  
RECOMMENDED MOTION: 
I move Council approve the proposed replat of Lots 1-6 and Lots 11-16, Block 1, Lake Dallas Sites.

Lake Cities Broadband Committee 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
 
Consider and Act on a resolution and an Inter-Local Agreement (ILA) with the City of Corinth for 
a Broadband Study.   
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
 
Despite the growing dependence on technology, recent discussion with Lake Cities Broadband Committee 
revealed that the community may not have the level of broadband access as defined and reported by the 
Federal Communications Commission. The Digital Divide could be much greater not only in terms of access 
but also with respect to how residents, businesses, and institutions are adopting and using online 
resources in the Community. The proposal provides various service options for the committee to consider 
in addressing the gaps. The aggregate area represents 197.7 road miles and 17.8 square mile.  
 
The proposal received from Connected Nation (CN) is lined out below:  
 
1. Field Validation, Mapping and Data Analysis  
a. Scope: CN will build upon its statewide broadband data collection and mapping 
activity and the input from the Lake Cities Broadband Committee to conduct a 
targeted broadband access field validation and audit. The broadband field 
validation and outside plant audit will be performed to test and confirm provider 
service boundaries, deployed infrastructure assets, broadband speeds, and 
delivery platforms.  
b. Deliverables: Once this analysis is complete the following will be available  
i. An interactive map of the Community with data later representing the 
validated broadband infrastructure data. 
ii. Field audit report and data analysis  
2. Demand Survey 
a. Scope: Scope:  CN will develop a customized online survey portal, to be made 
available for Lake Cities’ residents, businesses, and institutions. The survey will 
examine the broadband supply and demand landscape in the community across 
households, businesses, and community anchor institutions including healthcare, 
libraries, schools, public safety, and others.    
b. Deliverables:  Once this analysis is complete the following will be available  
i. An executive summary of the survey results and corresponding data 
analysis. 
ii.  An interactive map with survey respondent data to target areas of most 
significant broadband demand.  
iii.  An interactive data portal with survey results and benchmark data to 
other communities. 
3. Asset Inventory 
a. Scope:  CN will work with Lake Cities stakeholders to identify assets within the 
community that can be leveraged to accelerate or enhance broadband 
infrastructure deployment.   
b. Deliverable:  Once this analysis is complete the following will be available  
i. An interactive map with the comprehensive asset inventory and the 
ability to isolate various data layers. 
4. Strategic Plan 
a. Scope:   If the community selects to pursue and complete the project options 
described in sections 1 and 2, CN will use the broadband data captured in the 
infrastructure audit and validation process and demand survey to develop a 
comprehensive assessment and broadband strategic plan. The plan will include a 
set of recommended actions that must be edited and prioritized by the 
Broadband Committee. Once prioritized, CN will develop a comprehensive 
assessment and plan with an implementation matrix.  
b. Deliverable:  Once this analysis is complete the following will be available 
i.  A comprehensive strategic plan document estimated to be 25-40 pages 
delivered in electronic pdf format. 
5. Mobile Broadband Policy Analysis and Coverage Planning  
a. Scope:  CN will examine the federal, state, and local rules that influence the 
deployment of small cells and 5G infrastructure in the community. Analysis will 
include reviewing the regulations pertaining to size, shape, and placement of 
wireless network equipment as well as pertinent fee caps and agreements.  
6. Broadband Planning Support Services  
a. Scope: CN will remotely attend regular Broadband Committee meetings and 
provide updates on federal, state, and local broadband activities, best practices, 
or innovations which may be relevant to Lake Cities’ strategic goals. CN will also 
make available subject matter experts in GIS, policy, research, and engineering 
to follow-up on requests or inquiries to keep the Lake Cities Broadband 
Committee on the leading edge of broadband developments and opportunities 
 
 FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION: 
 
The Broad Band Committee has recommended funding for the following Projects: 
  
• Project 1: Field Validation, Mapping and Data Analysis 
a. Cost: $25,000 
b. Time Frame: 2 months  
• 
Project 2: Demand Survey 
a. Cost: $9,500 
b. Time Frame: 3 Month  
• Project 4: Strategic Plan 
a. Cost: $9,000 
b. Time: 2 months after completion of mapping and demand survey 
 
The Lake Cities will be sharing the cost of the three recommended projects. The total cost for all 
the recommended projects is $43,500. The portion Lake Dallas will be responsible for is, 17.7% 
of the total cost, which is $7,700.  This cost will be paid out of the Administrations Consultants 
and Professionals line item.  
 
RECOMMENDED MOTIONS: 
 
I move to approve/deny a resolution and inter-local agreement with the City of Corinth for 
Broadband Study.

Executive Summary 
 
 
Background 
 
Connected Nation (CN) is an organization dedicated to expanding the access, adoption, and 
use of broadband and broadband-enabled technologies. Since 2001, CN has been providing 
community broadband planning services to states and municipalities across the country. 
Though terminologies and focus areas may change over time, the pillars of an effective 
community broadband assessment process have consistently involved: 
 
the engagement of local leadership, pre-planning, and identification of expectations; 
 
public events designed to build awareness and inform and educate local citizens; 
 
community-wide and sector-specific data collection and benchmarking; 
 
data analysis and review, including a snapshot of the local broadband ecosystem; and  
 
drafting, reviewing, finalizing, and publicizing the community’s strategic broadband 
plan. 
 
CN has provided highlights of its extensive experience in state and community broadband 
planning in the Company Information section of this proposal. It’s with the experience and 
expertise that CN proposes supporting Lake Cities with assessing their broadband issues and 
opportunities and developing steps to improve the technology landscape for their residents, 
businesses, and institutions. The proposal is organized to focus on various technical services 
options for consideration. Each option includes detail of the scope, time, cost, deliverable and 
an example of similar work, if applicable.  
 
Statement of Need  
 
Technology plays a pivotal role in how businesses operate, the types of services consumers 
expect, how institutions serve the community, and where consumers choose to live, work, and 
play. The success of any community has also become dependent on how broadly and deeply 
the community adopts technology resources, which includes access to reliable high-speed 
networks, digital literacy of residents, and the use of online resources locally for business, 
government, and leisure. 
 
Despite the growing dependence on technology, recent discussions with Lake Cities 
Broadband Committee revealed that the community may not have the level of broadband 
access as defined and reported by the Federal Communications Commission. The Digital 
Divide could be much greater not only in terms of access but also with respect to how 
residents, businesses and institutions are adopting and using online resources in the 
community. The following proposal provides various service options for the Committee to 
consider in addressing these gaps. The Lake Cities community, referenced as “community”, is 
comprised of four communities: Corinth, Hickory Creek, Lake Dallas and Shady Shores as 
defined by boundary data maintained by Denton County. The aggregate area represents 197.7 
road miles and 17.8 square miles.

Project Options 
 
 
1. Field Validation, Mapping and Data Analysis  
Scope:   CN will build upon its statewide broadband data collection and mapping activity and 
the input from the Lake Cities Broadband Committee to conduct a targeted broadband access 
field validation and audit. The broadband field validation and outside plant audit will be 
performed to test and confirm provider service boundaries, deployed infrastructure assets, 
broadband speeds, and delivery platforms. CN’s Engineering & Technical Services (ETS) staff 
will utilize a variety of resources for validation support, including provider coverage maps, FCC 
databases, public feedback on the broadband maps, and voluntary provider data submissions. 
Based upon initial analysis, CN has identified the following internet service providers as 
offering services in the community:  
 
AMG Technology Investment Group (Nextlink) 
 
CenturyLink, Inc. 
 
Charter Communications 
 
Frontier Communications 
 
Grande Communications 
 
Skybeam, Inc. 
 
Southwestern Bell (AT&T) 
 
Speed of Light 
 
Validation will include wireline and fixed wireless platform types and include the road miles 
defined in the previous section. CN’s validation and verification methodologies have undergone 
stringent reviews that are based on industry accepted standards to reduce the risk of 
overstating broadband coverage and to develop products to inform and promote data-driven 
decisions that will expand broadband access. CN will document findings using these 
methodologies in a field report and aggregate the validated infrastructure data in an interactive 
map. In the course of field validation activities, CN will also identify strategic vertical assets that 
are not included in existing Lake Cities databases that could be leveraged for broadband 
expansion. Asset attributes will not be collected. Travel is required and will be dependent upon 
any national or state travel restrictions or guidance being lifted. 
 
Time:   2 months 
Cost:   $25,000 (includes travel cost) 
Deliverables:  
1. An interactive map of the community with data layers representing the validated 
broadband infrastructure data. 
2. Field audit report and data analysis 
Example:

2. Demand Survey 
Scope:  CN will develop a customized online survey portal, to be made available for Lake 
Cities’ residents, businesses, and institutions. The survey will examine the broadband supply 
and demand landscape in the community across households, businesses, and community 
anchor institutions including healthcare, libraries, schools, public safety, and others. The 
survey data will allow the examination of several metrics related to the community’s barriers 
and opportunities to broadband and technology use in the community. This survey will 
ultimately help gauge the gaps in access, adoption, and use of broadband and define potential 
expansion opportunities based on the demand analysis.   
CN will calculate sample sizes and breadth of survey distribution required to ensure that the 
data is useful and sufficient for analysis. Lake Cities leaders and community stakeholders will 
be responsible for promoting completion of the online survey. No travel is required. 
Time:   3 months 
Cost:   $9,500  
Deliverables:  
1. An executive summary of the survey results and corresponding data analysis. 
2. An interactive map with survey respondent data to target areas of most significant 
broadband demand.  
3. An interactive data portal with survey results and benchmark data to other 
communities.

3. Asset Inventory 
Scope:  CN will work with Lake Cities stakeholders to identify assets within the community that 
can be leveraged to accelerate or enhance broadband infrastructure deployment.  
Vertical assets will include, but are not limited to, structures such as towers less than 200’ 
which may not be registered in the FCC’s ASR database, grain elevators, silos, water towers, 
or other tall structures that could be leveraged to develop a fixed wireless broadband system. 
This inventory will seek to identify the asset, asset owner, exact location, and other pertinent 
information. Upon a first pass collection of this data, CN will employ a process to conduct 
quality assurance on the data culminating in an on-the-ground review of assets, to ensure the 
completeness of the data collected and to answer any outstanding questions that might exist 
after the initial data inventory is conducted. Utility or other poles can also be integrated into the 
database and map provided that the community provides the geographic data in a shpfile, kmz 
file or other usable format in addition to the corresponding attribute data. 
Horizontal assets will include, but are not limited to, dark and lit fiber, long haul and metro 
fiber, conduit and/or other assets that can be used to support network deployment. The 
horizontal asset inventory will primarily be developed through desktop research, access to 
subscription based data, and integration of data provided by the community. Travel is required 
and will be dependent upon any national or state travel restrictions or guidance being lifted. 
Time:   3 months 
Cost:   $16,000 (includes travel cost) 
Deliverable:  An interactive map with the comprehensive asset inventory and the ability to 
isolate various data layers.

4. Strategic Plan 
Scope:   If the community selects to pursue and complete the project options described in 
sections 1 and 2, CN will use the broadband data captured in the infrastructure audit and 
validation process and demand survey to develop a comprehensive assessment and 
broadband strategic plan. The plan will include a set of recommended actions that must be 
edited and prioritized by the Broadband Committee. Once prioritized, CN will develop a 
comprehensive assessment and plan with an implementation matrix. This body of work will 
detail next steps for addressing any deficiencies or opportunities for improving the local 
technology ecosystem. The plan and implementation matrix will serve as a blueprint to 
coordinating at federal, state, and local levels and leveraging technology to advance economic, 
social, and educational opportunities for families, businesses, and institutions in the 
community.  
Deliverable:   A comprehensive strategic plan document estimated to be 25-40 pages delivered 
in electronic pdf format. 
Time:   2 months after completion of mapping and demand survey.  
Cost:   $9,000  
 
5. Mobile Broadband Policy Analysis and Coverage Planning 
Scope:  CN will examine the federal, state, and local rules that influence the deployment of 
small cells and 5G infrastructure in the community. Analysis will include reviewing the 
regulations pertaining to size, shape, and placement of wireless network equipment as well as 
pertinent fee caps and agreements. CN will work the Broadband Committee and other local 
stakeholders to identify strategies to accelerate investment and deployment of next-generation 
technologies by wireless carriers throughout the community. No travel is required. 
Time:   2 months 
Cost:   $6,000 
 
6. Broadband Planning Support Services 
Scope:   CN will remotely attend regular Broadband Committee meetings and provide updates 
on federal, state, and local broadband activities, best practices, or innovations which may be 
relevant to Lake Cities’ strategic goals. CN will also make available subject matter experts in 
GIS, policy, research, and engineering to follow-up on requests or inquiries in order to keep the 
Lake Cities Broadband Committee on the leading edge of broadband developments and 
opportunities. Any requests beyond 10 hours per month will need to be approved and invoiced 
at an hourly rate of $200. No travel is required. 
Time:   Monthly 
Cost:   $2,000

Company Information 
 
Connected Nation (CN) was originally founded on February 19, 2001, as the Center for 
Information Technology Enterprise (CITE) in Bowling 
Green, Kentucky, to promote technology expansion in 
Kentucky. CITE evolved into ConnectKentucky, a public-
private initiative focused on conducting broadband 
mapping research and grassroots community-level 
planning statewide. ConnectKentucky led community 
planning efforts in all 120 Kentucky counties which 
helped to expand the use of the emerging technologies 
of the early 2000s. Other states began to seek that same 
type of guidance, and, to facilitate a multi-state 
consultancy, Connected Nation was formed in 2007.  
CN has nearly 20 years of experience providing strategic 
consulting and advisory services at the federal, state, 
and local community levels in order to accelerate and 
expand broadband access. CN’s strategic consulting 
and advisory services provide a multi-discipline view of 
the broadband landscape by providing broadband and 
telecommunications research, policy insights, mapping, 
engineering, and federal, state, and local strategic 
planning services.  
CN has experience and a process to inform and develop 
a comprehensive plan with measurable outcomes that is 
representative of multi-sector stakeholders. Evidence of 
state-level engagement and comprehensive plan 
development include the production of the Nevada State 
Broadband Action Plan and Puerto Rico's Gigabit Island 
Plan. A recent example of a community-level 
engagement and technology action plan is available via 
the following link for Ward County, Texas: http://connectmycommunity.org/ward-county/  
CN enjoys a strong policy staff that fully understands the telecommunications industry, 
drawing on years of experience working with states on broadband issues and having 
experience in Washington both with the FCC and with our nation’s legislators. This experience 
allows for robust development of policy and programs that can help pave a mutually agreeable 
path toward greater availability and expansion of broadband services. 
CN has facilitated the development of state-level task forces or similar governance committees 
in 11 states focusing on strategic planning initiatives related to broadband. Examples include, 
but are not limited to:  
 
Alaska Broadband Task Force

Interlocal Agreement for Grant from Denton County for CARES Act Funding 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
 
Consider and Act on a resolution approving an Interlocal Agreement  with Denton County 
regarding a grant of Coronavirus Relief Funds pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act and authorizing development of an economic development 
grant program relating to use of said grant funds.  
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
 
Denton County has received federal funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act 
(the “CARES” Act) to address and respond to the impact and effects of the COVID-19 Emergency. The 
County has established a COVID-19 municipality funding program, allowing the County to grant money to 
municipalities. The use of the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) is to assist a municipality with its expenditures 
incurred because of COVID-19 and to potentially fund a local economic relief grant program.  
 
The CRF Funds/Municipal Funds allows for the following uses:  
 
1. Necessary Expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the effect of 
COVID-19.  
2. Were not accounted for the in the most recently approved budget of the municipality, including 
any amendment  
3. Are incurred between March 1, 2020 and December 30, 2020 
 
 FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION: 
 
The CFR funding calculation is based on the higher of each city’s 2019 NCTCOG estimated 
population (7,260) or 2018 ACS estimated population of (7,944) multiped by $55 Per Capita:  
 
7,944 
X $55 
$436,920 
 
 
Staff is proposing that City request $75,000 for eligible expenses that the City has already 
incurred as well as future expenses. Staff is recommending this amount to cover the cost of the 
following:  
1.  
 
The remaining $361,920 the County will be able to utilize for Business Grant Program, specifically 
for Lake Dallas business. The guidelines for eligibility and application process for such a grant 
program will need to be established, with any such grant being required to comply with any 
guidelines and directives issued by the federal government. 
 
RECOMMENDED MOTIONS: 
 
I move to approve/deny a resolution approving an interlocal agreement with Denton County 
for a grant to the City for Coronavirus Relief Funds and development of an economic 
development grant program providing for use of such funds.

3 
Interlocal Cooperation Agreement 
Coronavirus Relief Fund- Municipality Distribution 
 
c. to promptly return to the County any Municipal Funds not used; 
 
d. to participate in the Forum; 
 
e. to maintain proper and adequate records of its own expenses, including monthly 
uploads to Dropbox, and supporting documentation of the expenditures, and 
provide copies of, or access to such, at any time as required by the County; 
 
f. to maintain proper and adequate records of the expenses of any grantees of 
Municipal Funds, including monthly uploads to Dropbox, and supporting

any time as required by the County; 
 
g. to return the Statement of Compliance Certificate by February 1, 2021; 
 
h. to cooperate and coordinate with other members in the Forum concerning a 
federal compliance audit; and 
 
i. to comply with Chapter 381 and Chapter 380, if applicable. 
 
USE OF FUNDS 
 
10. Amounts paid from the Treasury’s Coronavirus Relief Fund are subject to the restrictions 
outlined in the Guidance for State, Territorial, Local, and Tribal Governments (dated April 22, 
2020) and set forth in section 601(d) of the Social Security Act, as added by section 5001 of the 
CARES Act.  See Attachment C, which is incorporated by reference into this agreement. 
 
11. Section 601(d) allows CRF funds/Municipal Funds to cover only those costs that: 
 
a. are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with 
respect to the effects COVID-19; 
 
b. were not accounted for in the most recently approved budget [of the 
Municipality], including any amendments; and 
 
c. are incurred between March 1, 2020 and December 30, 2020.  See Coronavirus 
Relief Fund Frequently Asked Questions (Updated as of May 4, 2020).  See 
Attachment C. 
 
12. “Necessary Expenditure” Condition.  The use of the money is limited to “necessary 
expenditures.”  The Treasury intends for broad interpretation of the word “necessary,” meaning 
“reasonably necessary for its intended use in the reasonable judgment of the government officials 
responsible for spending the Fund payments.”  The Treasury’s standard, reasonable judgment, 
adopts a subjective, not objective standard.  Examples of eligible expenditures include, but are 
not limited to, payment for certain types of: 
 
4 
Interlocal Cooperation Agreement 
Coronavirus Relief Fund- Municipality Distribution 
 
a. medical expenses; 
 
b. public health expenses; 
 
c. payroll expenses; 
 
d. expenses relating to facilitating compliance; 
 
e. expenses associated with providing economic support in connection with the 
COVID-19 public health emergency; and 
 
f. any other COVID-19-related expense reasonably necessary to the function of 
government. 
 
13. Funds may not be used to fill shortfalls in governmental revenue to cover expenditures 
that would not otherwise qualify under section 601(d).  REVENUE REPLACEMENT IS 
STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND IS NOT A PERMISSIBLE USE OF FUNDS. 
 
14. “Due To” Condition.  The requirement that expenditures be incurred “due to” the public 
health emergency created by COVID-19 means that expenditures must be used for actions taken 
to respond to the public health emergency.  These may include expenditures incurred by the 
Municipality to respond directly to the emergency, as well as expenditures incurred to respond to 
second-order effects of the emergency (e.g., economic support to those suffering from 
employment or business interruptions due to COVID-19-related business closures). 
 
15. The Municipality expressly agrees without qualification or exception to adhere and 
comply with section 601(d) and the accompanying guidelines regarding its spending and uses of 
the Funds. 
 
16. Return of Unused Funds by Municipality.   Any Municipal Funds not spent on eligible 
expenses before December 30, 2020 must be returned to the County within 30 days after 
December 30, 2020. 
CRF COMPLIANCE FORUM 
 
17. Description. The Forum is a county-wide initiative between the County and all of the 
Municipalities that have requested upfront funding of the Municipal Funds. It is a single, 
integrated initiative to mutually benefit all municipalities and the County. 
 
18. Purpose.  The Forum shall work for the mutual benefit of the County and the 
Municipalities, which will promote administrative efficiency, streamline initial compliance 
measures, and continuing through a potential audit, and foster collaboration between our 
counties.   
 
19. Benefits. The primary goals of the Forum are to:

b. provide assistance with documentation guidelines;

suits, charges, or legal or administrative proceedings, claims and losses, including, without 
limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs, caused by or arising out of any act or omission of the 
Municipality relating to the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to any ineligible 
expenditures.  
 
21. Recoupment.  If the County, or its designee, reasonably determines that all or a portion of a 
Municipality’s expenditure of Municipal Funds is an ineligible expenditure, then the Municipality 
shall immediately reimburse the County in an amount equal to the amount of the ineligible 
expenditure from funds of the Municipality other than Municipal Funds granted pursuant to this 
Agreement, and provide to the County evidence of such reimbursement.  The Municipality shall 
have 30 days of receipt of the County’s determination of an ineligible expenditure to reimburse the 
County for such expense. If the Municipality chooses to subsequently grant its Municipal Funds, it 
shall be responsible for properly tracing and accounting for when, how, why and by whom the 
expenses were ultimately incurred. This includes the documentation responsibilities listed in 
Paragraph 9(f-g) above. In the event the County has to enforce this Agreement, it shall be entitled to 
recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in doing so.  
 
22. Offset.  To the extent allowable by law, the County reserves the right in its sole discretion to 
apply any money, damages or costs incurred as a result of a material breach of this agreement by the 
Municipality against the future distribution of future tax revenues or receipts from the County to the 
Municipality.

Agreement and is binding on the parties and their legal representatives, receivers, executors, 
successors, agents and assigns. 
 
27. Amendment. Any Amendment of this Agreement must be by written instrument dated and 
signed by both parties. 
 
28. Severability. No partial invalidity of this Agreement shall affect the remainder unless the

MEMORANDUM 
 
To: 
All Denton County Mayors 
 
From: Denton County Commissioners Court 
 
Date: May 29, 2020 
 
Re: 
COVID-19 Relief Funds – CRF Compliance Forum 
 
 
The purpose of this memorandum is to provide you with an explanation of the Denton County  
CRF Compliance Forum (the Forum) relating to the disbursement of funds to your municipality 
(“Municipal Funds”) from the Coronavirus Relief Fund (“CRF”). 
 
Description 
The Alliance will consist of representatives from both the County and each municipality electing 
an upfront allotment of Municipal Funds. 
 
The Alliance will act as a single, integrated program in which everyone works together, rather 
than separately.  The intension of the Alliance is to benefit everyone mutually. 
 
The work of the Alliance will commence immediately and will end upon the completion of the 
Treasury compliance audit. 
 
Purpose 
The purpose of the Alliance is to promote administrative efficiency, streamline initial 
compliance measures, continue coordination through a potential audit, and foster collaboration 
between our cities and County. 
 
A highly collaborative, organized effort will ease the administrative burdens and costs of 
complying with the CRF regulations. The Forum will establish a framework for tracking and 
accounting for the disbursements and spending.  
 
Identify funds not likely to be expended so they can be reallocated to other Denton County 
programs.  
  
Benefits 
The Forum will help provide answers to ongoing issues and specific questions (e.g., eligible uses 
of funds).  
 
Denton County Commissioners Court 
 
 
 
2 | P a g e  
 
The Forum will also assist with documentation and retention of eligible expenses, both of which 
should reduce overall noncompliance risk. Our efforts on the front-end is a much better way to 
prepare for and manage a U.S. Treasury compliance audit. 
 
A collaborative effort will also help strategically allocate funds to the areas and industries in 
most need, avoiding duplicative efforts.  
 
Forum Overview 
 
Why is this necessary?  Two important reasons. First, the CRF guidelines are new, and there is a 
reasonable amount of uncertainty about some of the specifics. We would prefer a unified 
understanding of the guidelines.  Second, the U.S. Treasury has the ability, under the CRF 
regulations, to recoup (clawback) any funds not used, or used for ineligible purposes.  
 
What are we asking for from our cities?  Your commitment to work together.  An appointed 
person from each municipality joins the Forum and participates in monthly meetings to address 
and communicate ongoing concerns.

AGENDA ITEM 14 
 
 
 
 
CITY COUNCIL 
AGENDA MEMO 
Prepared By: John Cabrales Jr, City Manager 
 
 
 
   June 11, 2020 
Revising the Declaration of Local Disaster Issued by the Mayor 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
 
Consider, discuss, and take appropriate action on a Resolution of the City Council of the City of 
Lake Dallas, Texas, modifying the Declaration of Local Disaster adopted pursuant to Resolution 
05142020-15 and orders related thereto. 
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
 
 At the May 28, 2020, the City Council approved Resolution No. 05142020-15 extending and 
modifying the City’s local disaster declaration relating to measures to be taken to address the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including the adoption of certain restrictions designed to blunt the spread 
of the virus within the City.  On June 3, 2020, Governor Abbott issued Executive Order GA-26 
implementing “Phase 3” of the Opening Texas program. Executive Order GA-26 modifies or 
removes the restrictions previously imposed on the operation of non-essential businesses and 
other activities within the state.  Executive Order GA-26 continues to preempt to a great extent 
local orders that conflict with Executive Order GA-26. 
 
Section 2.I. “Peddlers and Solicitors” of Resolution No. 05282020-suspends the issuance of 
permits and licenses pursuant to the Lake Dallas Municipal Code Chapter 78 for peddlers and 
solicitors. This suspension was implemented as a precautionary procedure to minimize the 
spreading of COVID-19 to staff and the public. In light of the removal of many restrictions on the 
operation of business with the state set out in Executive Order GA-26, staff recommends that the 
prohibition on issuance of peddler and solicitor permits be repealed. 
 
RECOMMENDED MOTIONS: 
 
I move to approve/deny a Resolution modifying the Declaration of Local Disaster adopted 
pursuant to Resolution No. 05142020-15 and orders related thereto to repeal the suspension of 
issuance of peddler and solicitor permits.
