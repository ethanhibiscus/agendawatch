Financial Report 
Mr. Hitchin reported on the financial accounts for March and April.  In March, the first eleven 
emergency loans were dispersed, totaling $44,000.  The regular beerwerks program charges for postage 
were paid, in the amount of $317.99 (as a reminder this is a pass through for the EDA) and the annual 
$499.95 QuickBooks subscription was paid.  In April, the last emergency loan was dispersed in the 
amount of $2,500 and a check in the amount of $5,000 has been drafted for a façade project that has 
been completed at 137 N Wayne Avenue (façade funds are reimbursed from the city).  Mr. Hitchin 
noticed that the administrative and beerwerks expenses were not updated on the April dashboard, he 
will revise and send the updated report (sent April 30, 2020).  Mr. Reed made a motion to approve the 
façade check as written.  The motion was seconded by Mr. Snyder and passed by a unanimous roll call

Committee Reports 
a. Audit: Ms. Bandy has received the bank reconciliation reviews but had not reviewed them yet.  
Mr. Hitchin will move this item to the next meeting agenda.   
b. Loans: The RLF committee approved twelve loans totaling $46,500 during March and April as a 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of emergency shut down of businesses.  There is 
currently a balance of just over $2,000 in the RLF account and there are five additional 
application requests in hand.  Out of the current RLF program, four businesses have taken 
advantage of deferrals in April, three to-date for May and there are two outstanding loans that 
staff has not received communication from since March.  Mr. Hitchin passed along a comment 
from one of the loan participants who expressed their gratitude for allowing deferrals during 
this difficult time.   
 
Augusta Health Enhanced Access Plan 
Mr. Hitchin introduced Mark LaRosa, VP of Business Development & CSO of Augusta Health who shared 
his screen via zoom and gave a presentation on Augusta Health’s COPN Application to the Virginia 
Department of Health.  Augusta Health has made application for a free-standing outpatient diagnostic 
testing facility on its campus which would house one CT scanner and one MRI.  Augusta Health is 
considered the local hospital, being created twenty-five years ago when the Staunton and Waynesboro 
hospitals came together to create one facility. Over the past five years, Augusta Health has experienced 
steady growth in all the major imaging modalities, especially CT and MRI.  This is primarily due the 
growth in the over age 65 population which is higher than state or national averages.  This growth has 
resulted in Augusta Health experiencing an institutional need for an additional MRI unit and CT scanner 
3
 
3 
 
to be added to the complement Augusta Health CTs and MRIs.  Over the next 15 years, this growth is 
expected to continue in the Augusta, Waynesboro, and Staunton areas.  The Center will not only address 
growing demand, but it will also be structured as freestanding in order to offer MRI and CT services at a 
lower cost.  The Augusta Health’s freestanding imaging center will include a 3.0T MRI and 128 slice CT 
scanner in order to advance the specialized outpatient imaging capabilities in our area.  Sentara has also 
made an application for an MRI and CT scanner at a free-standing center to be located in Staunton.  
There is only need in our area’s market for one MRI and CT scanner and Augusta Health is looking for 
Waynesboro’s support of their application.  Waynesboro City Council has adopted a resolution at their 
recent meeting, in support of Augusta Health’s application.  After some brief discussion, Ms. Bandy 
made a motion authorizing the chairman to sign a resolution supporting approval of the COPN request 
for Augusta Health to the Virginia State Health Commission.  Mr. Brooks seconded the motion and it 
passed by a unanimous vote as follows: 
 
Mr. Fridley 
Aye 
Ms. Bandy 
Aye 
 
Ms. Sullivan 
Aye 
 
Mr. Brooks

Mr. Snyder

Abstaining due to conflict of interest 
 
Economic Development/COVID 19 Response Update 
Mr. Hitchin gave an update on the City’s response to the COVID-19.  He expressed appreciation to the 
board’s quick action taken with allowing deferrals of existing loans and for using the remaining balance 
in the RLF account for emergency loans.  Waynesboro was one of the first localities in the state to offer 
an emergency loan program and other localities both within the state and out of state have contacted 
the Waynesboro economic development office about modeling our program.  Staff has been following 
updates on the PPP and EIDL programs and been in contact with the local SBDC.  The office is 
maintaining an “open for business” list that can be found on the website and social media which is 
updated regularly as businesses change their status and operating hours and procedures.  At the end of 
March, the economic development office mailed out over one thousand letters to current business 
license holders within the city.  The letter gave information and links to website resources, a business 
survey and information on how to sign-up to receive newsletters and updates.  Staff has also sent out 
twelve COVID-19 related newsletters since March 1st with an average open rate of 40% which is a high 
rate for these types of communications.  As a result of the communications sent, we have received 
several new subscriptions to our newsletters and fifty-two responses to the business survey to-date.  
Mr. Hitchin gave a brief summary of the survey results received.  Staff is looking at working with regional 
and state partners to develop resources to support the relief and recovery stages ahead.  
 
Monthly Updates 
Tourism – Ms. Callison gave a brief overview for tourism.  Staff is staying active on social media with a 
large audience currently on their phones and social media accounts.  She is adapting state initiatives to 
have a Waynesboro spin and engaging the local followers more than visitors at this time.  She is working 
on building content on the tourism website, both for current purposes and for the future when things 
are more normal.  The Virginia Tourism Corporation has launched several campaign initiatives and she 
has been following that messaging to keep Waynesboro at top of mind for future travel.

Other Business/Discussion 
At the previous meeting, the Chairman asked about federal aid to localities.  Mr. Hitchin gave an update 
to the board.  The Waynesboro City Manager has created a task force of staff members to look at 
potential aid available to states/localities.  The USDA RD has some funding available for primarily 
broadband and expansion of telemedicine but there are also funds for business and industry loans.  The 
Department of Commerce EDA has $1.5B to use for infrastructure and planning and possibly capitalize 
local funds for loans.  The CDBG funds are also available, Waynesboro is an entitlement community so 
Waynesboro will have access to those funds.  Rules for the new programs are still being developed and 
staff is monitoring as updates are given.   
 
Correspondence and Communication of the Chairman 
The next regular meeting is scheduled for May 8th.  Unless new business should arise, this meeting will 
likely be canceled. 
 
 
There being no other business to discuss, Mr. Brooks made a motion to adjourn the meeting.  The 
meeting was adjourned at 4:58 PM.

Waynesboro small business is the lifeblood of our community and backbone of the economy.  They 
represent steadfast commitment by owners to provide goods and services to citizens and visitors while 
offering vast employment opportunities. However, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has forced 
widespread closures of small businesses threatening livelihoods, acute job losses, and imperiling the 
future of our local economy. 
 
FUNDING SOURCE 
The U.S. Treasury guidance allows states to use Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) dollars for expenditures 
“related to the provision of grants to small businesses to reimburse the costs of business interruption 
caused by required closure.” The Commonwealth of Virginia has elected to disperse a portion of its 
allocation to local governments.  The Waynesboro City Council has elected to use part of the City’s 
allocation to help preserve small business in Waynesboro by providing grants to eligible businesses. 
The RENAISSANCE FUND will provide up to $10,000 cash grants.
