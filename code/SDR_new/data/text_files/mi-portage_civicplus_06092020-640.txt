PUBLIC HEARINGS:   
 
ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS - ADULT USE MARIHUANA (ZONING):  Mayor Randall opened 
the public hearing and invited any citizens waiting on the public phone line to speak.  
Citizen Jevin Weyenberg (5817 Cheshire) spoke in favor of the proposed ordinance.  He 
stated that approving adult-use is the best approach to repel black market marihuana sales and 
supports the local economy by increasing jobs and tax revenue.  He thanked City Council for their 
efforts, noting citizen approval of the matter in recent ballot initiatives on marihuana.  Mayor Randall 
thanked Mr. Weyenberg for his support and efforts with the city throughout the process. 
Councilmember Urban stated he voted no during the first reading of this ordinance and 
planned to do so again.  He noted that there are provisions in the state law that he does not support, 
but he accepts the voter approval of marihuana.  He expressed concerns regarding the amount of 
marihuana made available under the proposed ordinance and the possibility of the substance ending 
up in the wrong hands.  Mr. Urban noted that in light of the annual Red Ribbon Week observance  
and prior conversations with his young daughter, he would be voting no again. 
Councilmember Ford stated he did not believe proximity would be an issue and understood 
the city is introducing the ordinance in small steps.  He expressed support for the ordinance. 
Councilmember Reid stated her hope that City Council will be open to reviewing the matter 
in the future should they find that revisions are needed once the ordinance goes into effect.  She 
stated that she has not received negative feedback from citizens and would be voting in support of 
the ordinance.  Councilmember Reid thanked the City Administration for their efforts and 
appreciated the ordinance that had been drafted. 
Mayor Pro Tem Pearson agreed with Councilmember Reid, also noting he had not received 
any negative feedback from citizens.  He also agreed with Councilmember Ford regarding the 1,000-
foot proximity.  He stated he would be voting in support of the ordinance, noting the prior citizen 
(4)          
 
Page 3 
 
May 26, 2020 
votes in support of marihuana.  He expressed appreciation for the prior Council meetings and staff 
efforts on the matter, as well as each Councilmember having input on the creation of the ordinance. 
Councilmember Knapp noted that adult-use marihuana is legal in Michigan and Portage 
voters have expressed support for marihuana.  She agreed with Councilmember Urban and Mr. 
Weyenberg that marihuana exists in Portage with or without the proposed ordinance, but she is 
hoping that the ordinance will provide for the best service and means for a consistent and reliable 
approach.  She stated she would be voting in support.   
Councilmember Urban stated he respects fellow Councilmember opinions but highlighted 
the contrary responses regarding marihuana in the 2017 Citizen Survey. 
Mayor Randall thanked everyone for their statements.  She stated that the City of Portage 
needed to define marihuana use in the city before it was defined by others.  She thanked the 
advocates that had reached out to the city, including Mr. Weyenberg.  The Mayor also agreed with 
Councilmember Reid regarding the flexibility for future ordinance revisions if necessary. 
Motion by Pearson, seconded by Reid, to close the public hearing.  Upon a voice vote, 
motion carried 7 to 0.  Motion by Ford, seconded by Burns, to adopt Ordinance Amendment #19/20-
A (5), allowing Adult Use Marihuana in certain districts, of Chapter 42, Land Development 
Regulations, Article 4 (Zoning).  Upon a roll call vote, motion carried 6 to 1 with Councilmember 
Urban voting no. 
 
REGULAR BUSINESS AGENDA: 
 
FISCAL YEAR 2020-2021 BUDGET APPROVAL AND RESOLUTIONS ADOPTION:  Mayor 
Randall asked the City Manager to summarize the proposed 2020-2021 Budget.  City Manager La 
Margo noted that the proposed budget has no increases to millages or fees, as well as no new 
millages or fees.  He relayed that the City Administration is putting safeguards in place to ensure 
expenditures do not outpace revenues in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Mr. La 
Margo noted the revision Councilmember Reid requested for the General Fund Reserve Policy 
Resolution during the Pre-Council Meeting and relayed that Deputy Director VanderVeen and 
Director Furry were available for questions. 
Councilmember Urban inquired whether Council had been provided with an updated 
General Fund Reserve Policy Resolution document.  City Manager La Margo responded that the 
options for the proposed revision were noted in his Pre-Council Meeting response e-mail with 
Deputy City Manager Herringa recommending the revision be implemented during the Regular 
Council Meeting. 
Motion by Reid, seconded by Knapp to amend language noted on page two of the General 
Fund Reserve Policy Resolution from “… the following provision be added to the General Fund 
Reserve Policy: ‘if the Fund Balance at the end of a fiscal year is above 24 percent, the City Council of 
the City of Portage shall be informed as to how the excess fund balance is to be utilized’” to “… the 
following provision be added to the General Fund Reserve Policy: ‘funds in excess of the 24% fund 
balance be spent on budgeted items.’” 
Mayor Pro Tem Pearson complimented the City Administration and Director Furry, noting 
that previously the Fund Balance was set at 25 percent and City Council would not have been aware 
of spending in that fund.  He stressed the need for transparency in light of the effects of the COVID-
19 pandemic and asked the City Manager to comment on Councilmember Reid’s suggested motion. 
City Manager La Margo responded that the City Administration would follow through on the 
will of the Council.  He noted that unexpected expenditures occasionally occur, but stated the City 
Administration will remain within budget and highlighted the planned quarterly budget review 
meetings with Council to guarantee this measure.

May 26, 2020 
Councilmember Reid noted her motion was provided by the City Administration and would 
not preclude the proposed budget; if an expense is not budgeted, it still requires Council approval.  
She relayed that this was the more flexible option suggested by the City Administration.  
Mayor Pro Tem Pearson asked the City Manager to read the Pre-Council Meeting response 
for clarity.  Mr. La Margo recited the response.  
City Attorney Brown stated that the City Administration would still need to adhere to the 
Purchasing Ordinance no matter what the General Fund Reserve Policy Resolution stated. 
Councilmember Knapp stated she did not believe the proposed revision was constricting 
and supported the change. 
Councilmember Urban stated that he had received the Pre-Council Meeting response e-mail 
but preferred a revised resolution document be presented to Council before a formal vote. 
Motion by Urban to table Councilmember Reid’s motion. There being no support, the 
motion did not pass.  City Council debate regarding procedures followed. 
Motion by Urban, seconded by Reid, to separate the General Fund Reserve Policy 
Resolution from the action recommended regarding the Fiscal Year 2020-2021 Proposed Budget.  
Upon a roll call vote, motion failed 2 to 5. 
City Manager La Margo stated his concurrence with the amended Resolution. 
Councilmember Knapp stated that she was unsure as to the purpose of postponing the 
vote, complimenting the Pre-Council Meeting responses provided by the City Administration.  Mayor 
Pro Tem Pearson and Councilmember Ford agreed. 
Councilmember Urban expressed his concern with changes made during a meeting and the 
reason for his prior motion. 
Mayor Pro Tem Pearson noted those members present at the Pre-Council Meeting and the 
discussion during the Pre-Council Meeting regarding Councilmember Reid’s concerns.  He noted that 
Council has met several times previously with staff regarding the proposed budget and expressed 
support for the revision to the Resolution. 
Mayor Randall stated the shortened workweek due to the Memorial Day holiday did not 
help the situation with both the Pre-Council Meeting and the Regular Meeting on the same day, but 
stressed the importance of the Pre-Council Meeting.  She agreed with Councilmember Reid and 
asked to move forward with the budget. 
Mayor Randall requested the City Clerk to call the vote regarding Councilmember Reid’s 
earlier motion.  Upon roll call vote, motion carried 7 to 0. 
Motion by Burns, seconded by Pearson, to approve the Fiscal Year 2020-2021 Proposed 
Budget with Revisions, and adopt the General Appropriations Act, Salary and Wage, and General 
Fund Reserve Policy Resolutions. Councilmember Reid made a Point of Order to ensure 
Councilmember Burns’ motion included the revision to the General Fund Reserve Policy Resolution.  
Clarified motion by Burns, seconded by Pearson, to approve the Fiscal Year 2020-2021 Proposed 
Budget with Revisions, and adopt the General Appropriations Act, Salary and Wage, and revised 
General Fund Reserve Policy Resolutions. Upon a roll call vote, motion carried 7 to 0. 
Councilmember Reid thanked staff for their efforts, likening this particular budget to a birth, 
and expressed appreciation for the upcoming quarterly budget reviews. 
 
ENERGY SERVICES COMPANY:  Councilmember Reid indicated that this was the first-time, 
unique contract and she asked City Manager La Margo to provide additional elaboration. 
City Manager La Margo explained the city’s efforts toward cost-efficiency and energy 
savings, noting that the proposed firm will be contracted to review the city’s line-item budgets to 
assist in this endeavor.  He further deferred to Deputy City Manager Herringa. 
(6)

May 26, 2020 
Deputy City Manager Herringa agreed that this endeavor is new for Portage but not for local 
governments and industries.  He stated that the city is hoping to improve its energy efficiency, which 
was first started by the Environmental Board.  He noted that the City Administration does not have 
the time truly necessary to perform an in-depth review, nor the expertise and that is where the 
vendor proves useful.  Mr. Herringa stated that there is no initial charge to the city for the service 
until the vendor realizes energy savings for the city and will then receive a portion of the savings.  He 
stated that any resulting City Hall projects will still go through the usual bidding process.  He closed 
by noting that the firm came recommended by other Michigan cities that have performed similar 
reviews. 
Councilmember Reid noted two other firms had also been interviewed. 
Councilmember Urban inquired how the savings would be determined.  Deputy City 
Manager Herringa responded that it would be based on actual dollars saved, with an eight to ten 
percent profit margin.  Councilmember Urban further asked how the entity selecting the project 
would be differentiated.  Mr. Herringa responded that the contract has metrics for determination 
and further noted that the city’s Fleet & Facilities Deputy Director has a Level One certification in 
building operations with knowledge on ESCO practices.  Councilmember Urban then asked about the 
timeline.  Deputy City Manager Herringa responded that the city researched firms in December, 
published the RFP in March, and closed on May 11th. 
Mayor Randall stated she looks forward to the review and has heard of the savings possible. 
Motion by Reid, seconded by Knapp, to enter into an agreement with Noresco for the 
provision of ESCO services for the period of July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2025 and authorize the City 
Manager to execute all documents related to this contract on behalf of the city.  Upon a roll call vote, 
motion carried 7 to 0. 
 
UNFINISHED BUSINESS AGENDA:   
 
ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS - ADULT USE MARIHUANA (BUSINESSES):  Mayor Randall 
deferred to the City Manager.  City Manager La Margo noted this was the second reading of the 
ordinance and asked if there were any questions.   
Councilmember Urban asked for clarification regarding which aspect was being discussed.  
City Attorney Brown noted that this portion of the adult-use marihuana ordinance related to the 
business aspect while the zoning aspect had been passed by Council during the public hearing 
segment of the meeting. 
Motion by Reid, seconded by Ford, to adopt Ordinance Amendment #19/20-6, Marihuana 
Businesses, of Chapter 14, Businesses, Article 12.  Upon a roll call vote, motion carried 6 to 1 with 
Councilmember Urban voting no. 
 
  
 
 
STATEMENTS OF CITY COUNCIL AND CITY MANAGER:  Councilmember Burns congratulated 
Finance Deputy Director VanderVeen as a fellow CPA on her promotion.  He then thanked those in 
the military and first responders in light of Memorial Day. 
 
  
Councilmember Ford echoed Mr. Burns’ comments and noted two Americans were scheduled 
to travel to space tomorrow with NASA.  He then congratulated City Manager La Margo and Deputy 
Director VanderVeen on passing their first budget. 
 
  
Councilmember Urban also congratulated Deputy Director VanderVeen and thanked Finance 
Director Bill Furry for his service. 
 
  
Councilmember Reid also congratulated Deputy Director VanderVeen and thanked Director 
Furry on his retirement.  She noted that this was the first Memorial Day in her experience without a 
parade or memorial service, which she missed but expressed gratitude for those keeping the country

safe.  Ms. Reid further noted that the Governor had extended the Stay Home, Stay Safe Executive 
Order through June 12th.  She understood this was frustrating but encouraged everyone to maintain 
safe practices. 
 
  
Councilmember Knapp congratulated Deputy Director VanderVeen and Director Furry, noting 
that Director Furry would still be around to advise the city, but she appreciated his knowledge and 
expertise.  Ms. Knapp thanked all staff for their efforts with the budget and noted appreciation for 
the upcoming quarterly budget reviews. 
 
  
City Manager La Margo commented that he has worked with a lot of department directors 
over time and noted that Director Furry continued to work diligently despite his pending retirement.  
He responded to Councilmember Reid that he had never heard comparing a budget to birth but 
stated that the city will get through this difficult time while meeting or exceeding the city’s current 
level of service.  He then expressed appreciation for Memorial Day noting his son currently serves in 
the military.  Mr. La Margo closed by reminding everyone that the beaches would remain closed until 
June 12th under the Governor’s orders, but tennis and pickleball courts would now be open. 
 
  
Mayor Pro Tem Pearson thanked Director Furry and congratulated Deputy Director 
VanderVeen.  He relayed his family history with the military in light of Memorial Day and thanked 
veterans for their service. 
 
  
Mayor Randall congratulated Deputy Director VanderVeen and relayed that the city would 
miss Director Furry.  She stated that the next Portager newsletter would be dedicated to the 2020 
graduates.  She thanked everyone for successfully conducting another remote meeting to 
accommodate the public and fulfill city business.

Honorable Mayor and City Council 
 
FROM:
Joseph La Margo, City Manager
 
SUBJECT:
Wetherbee Drive Sanitary Sewer and Water Main Improvements - Bid Tabulation
 
SUPPORTING PERSONNEL:
Kendra Gwin, Director of Transportation & Utilities
 
ACTION RECOMMENDED:
Award a construction contract for the Wetherbee Avenue 
Sanitary Sewer and Water Main Improvement Project to Balkema 
Excavating, Inc., of Kalamazoo, Michigan, in an amount not to 
exceed $593,381.45 and authorize the City Manager to execute 
all documents related to the contract on behalf of the city.
 
The FY 2017–18 and FY 2018–19 Capital Improvement Program budgets provide funding for the 
Wetherbee Avenue Sanitary Sewer and Water Main Improvement Project from Portage Road to 
Woodlawn Drive.  The project involves the installation of new sanitary sewer, new water main, storm 
drainage improvements, sidewalk and asphalt pavement replacement on Wetherbee Avenue from 
Portage Road to Woodlawn Drive.
On October 10, 2017, City Council awarded a contract in the amount of $39,315 to Hurley & Stewart, 
LLC, for the design and construction engineering for the project.  Project design is complete and on 
May 28, 2020, bids for the construction work were received from seven contractors.  The lowest bid 
was submitted by Balkema Excavating, Inc., of Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the amount of $593,381.45.  
Balkema Excavating has successfully completed many similar projects for the city, with the most recent 
being the South Shore Drive sanitary sewer installation and water main replacement project.
It is recommended that City Council award a construction contract for the Wetherbee Avenue Sanitary 
Sewer and Water Main Improvements to Balkema Excavating, Inc., of Kalamazoo, Michigan, in an 
amount not to exceed $593,381.45 and authorize the City Manager to execute all documents related to 
the contract on behalf of the city.  If approved by City Council, the project is expected to begin June 23, 
with completion anticipated in mid-September. 
 
FUNDING: Funds are budgeted in the FY 2017–18 and FY 2018-19 Capital Improvement Program 
budgets.

CITY COUNCIL AGENDA ITEM A.4.
JUNE 9, 2020
TO:
Honorable Mayor and City Council 
 
FROM:
Joseph La Margo, City Manager
 
SUBJECT:
Delinquent Water and Sewer Bills
 
SUPPORTING PERSONNEL:
Lauren VanderVeen, Interim Finance Director
 
ACTION RECOMMENDED:
Order notice to applicable property owners that all water and/or 
sewer charges remaining unpaid as of June 30, 2020 will be 
transferred to the 2020 city tax roll and assessed against the 
property for which the services were furnished.
 
In accordance with city ordinances, unpaid water and sewer utility accounts considered un-collectible 
by the Finance Director are required to be reported to City Council on an annual basis.  As of June 1, 
2020, unpaid utility accounts total $51,088.97.  A progressive series of six separate notifications have 
been issued to the customer/owner in accordance with city procedures, state laws and Municipal Code 
Section 82-374 through 82-376, and these notices have not resulted in payment in all cases.  A listing is 
attached showing the delinquent accounts.  An updated listing of delinquent accounts will be produced 
on Tuesday, June 9, 2020 to account for payments made to these accounts received between Monday, 
June 1, 2020 at 4:10 PM and Tuesday, June 9, 2020.
State law allows the unpaid charges to remain with the associated property. According to Chapter 82, 
Division 7, Section 82-197, Lien for Unpaid Charges, Portage Code of Ordinances, the unpaid accounts 
are to be transferred to the city tax roll and assessed against properties to which the services were 
provided.  Action by City Council to order notice to all applicable property owners that all unpaid water 
and/or sewer charges transferred to the 2020 city tax roll is requested to begin this process.

purchased a home outside City of Portage limits.  In order to comply with the requirement that 
Councilmembers be residents, Councilmember Ford will be resigning from the Portage City Council 
effective June 30, 2020.   His last City Council Meeting will be June 23, 2020.  
It is recommended that City Council accept the resignation of Councilmember Richard Ford.

2020 Ford Resignation from City Council
(19)          
To: Honorable Mayor and City Council 
From: Councilmember Richard Ford 
Date: 6/4/2020 
Subject: Resignation of Richard Ford  
Action Recommended: Accept the resignation of Richard Ford, effective June 30th 
Patricia, Jim, Terry, Claudette, Lori, and Chris;  
I am writing to announce my resignation from Portage City Council, effective June 30th. This 
decision did not come lightly as I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here both as a resident and 
as a councilmember. Last summer, I began working for Varnum LLP, with the majority of my 
time spent in their Grand Rapids office. To shorten my commute and ultimately spend more 
time with my family and young children, I recently purchased a home outside City of Portage 
limits, and thus June 30th will be my last day as a Portage resident.  
I can't tell you how much I am going to miss sitting beside you all on the dais. I learned so 
much personally and professionally serving on this council. I would like to give a special thank 
you to Mayor Randall, who inspired confidence in me as a young city board volunteer. I will 
always value her mentorship and friendship.  
I know that I am leaving a great thing behind. Serving this community has become a hobby of 
mine, and I am not quite sure how I will fill the void. All of you are excellent leaders, and I 
know that the City of Portage will remain a great, transparent, Natural Place to Move under 
your leadership.  
Joe, Adam, Michael, Devin, Erica, Nich, Stacy, Chris, Kendra, Kathleen, Kim, Lauren, Shannon, 
Ed, Meshia, Rod, Larry, and Randy, and all other staff, both retired and current (in case I left 
someone out), 
As I often thank staff during council comments, I'd like to express my gratitude for the 
commitment each of you put into making Portage a fantastic place to live. I've always 
appreciated the dedication you bring to serving our community.  
To the Residents, 
Thank you for allowing me to be part of your leadership team over the past six-plus years. My 
two elections were very humbling, and Portage will always hold a special place in my heart. 
Sincerely, 
(20)

A Committee of the Whole meeting was held on May 14, 2020 to discuss the subject of City Attorney

requested that the subject of issuance of an RFP/RFQ be brought before the Council at an upcoming

separate proposals be solicited for City Attorney services and for prosecution services.
It is recommended that City Council instruct the City Administration to solicit proposals for City 
Attorney and prosecution legal services.  It is anticipated that results of an RFP/RFQ will be brought to
