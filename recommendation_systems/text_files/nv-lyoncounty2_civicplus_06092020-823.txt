6. Presentation and Reading of Miscellaneous Correspondence- None 
7. Advisory Board Reports- None 
8. Public Hearing Items- 
8.a. (for Possible Action) SCI (Summit Construction Inc.) - Conditional Use 
Permit - Request for a Conditional Use Permit to allow for a landscape material yard 
for sales to the general public in the LI-S (Light Industrial - Suburban) zoning district; 
located at 7013 E. Hwy 50, Dayton (019-192-05) PLZ-20-0004. 
Planner, Tammy Kinsley presented the staff report. The proposed use is allowed under 
Title 15 in this zoning district with a conditional use permit. Staff is recommending 
approval based on the findings and conditions.  
Commissioner Retzer had questions regarding conditions of approval 1, 2 & 24 
pertaining to fencing, landscaping and parking requirements.  
Planner, Tammy Kinsley explained the conditions of approval were taken from Title 15 
Development Standards based on the type of application, proposed use and size of 
area being developed. 
2 
 
Commissioner Retzer asked if there was a way to amend or remove conditions. 
Planner, Tammy Kinsley, stated the conditions placed on the application are based on 
Title 15 Development standards. Therefore all conditions of approval must be met.  
Mr. Viksna, applicant, spoke to the Planning Commission explaining he was unware 
there would be so many conditions associated with this type of permit. The cost of 
developing the property in the manner in which the development standards require is 
very costly. He went on to explain the proposed use is simply outdoor storage of 
landscaping materials, supply delivery and pick up at this point. He does not intend to 
utilize the entire parcel at this point just a small area. The applicant also asked if there 
was a way to mitigate some of the conditions to be fulfilled as necessary such as 
parking, restrooms, landscaping and fencing. The applicant referenced surrounding 
properties/businesses that do not seem to have the same development standards that 
are being place on him 
Planner, Rob Pyzel stated several of the properties referenced by the applicant were 
existing uses before Title 15 went into effect and the development standards vary 
depending on the parcel zoning and type of use.   
Commissioner Cassinelli asked staff if the conditions of approval and design standards 
placed on this application would change if it were simply outdoor storage and if the 
conditions pertaining to the retail sales portion could be fulfilled when and if an actual 
retail store is built or if all conditions need to be met before the applicant can obtain a 
business license and sale materials. 
Planner, Rob Pyzel, said the applicant will be expected to fulfill all conditions before 
they would be able to proceed with retail sales, however staff is willing to work with the 
applicant to see what conditions can be met in various stages. 
Commissioner Allan asked the applicant if they had sat down with staff to go over the 
development standards, conditions of approval and process. The applicant responded 
he had not, he was unaware that was on option.     
Planner, Tammy Kinsley, responded she spoke with the applicants wife several times, 
went over all the submittal requirements, conditions of the Conditional Use Permit and 
informed Mrs. Viksna she could meet with Staff if she had any further questions or 
concerns.  
County Manager, Jeff Page, said the Planning Commission has three options; approval, 
denial, or continuance with the applicants approval. Based on what the applicant has 
submitted and his intent, the conditions and findings are appropriate. Mr. Page went on 
to say he would recommend a continuance so the applicant can meet with staff in a 
round table to revisit his intent and see if a revision of the proposed use is appropriate 
and or if a gradual implementation of  the conditions is possible.  
Commissioner Cassinelli asked staff to clarify, if the applicant’s application is approved 
he has a year to comply with the approval conditions? Mr. Pyzel stated that the 
applicant has a year to comply with all approval conditions before the Conditional Use 
Permit expires. However all conditions must be met before the applicant can proceed 
with retail sales.  
3 
 
Commissioner Ritter asked Mr. Pyzel about the parking requirements. If the applicant 
changes the scale of land developed and operations can the parking requirements be 
scaled up or down accordingly? Was this question answered? 
Public Participation- None 
Commissioner Allan made a motion to continue the request for a Conditional Use 
Permit to allow for a landscape material yard for sales to the general public in the LI-S 
(Light Industrial - Suburban) zoning district to the May 12, 2020 Planning Commission 
Meeting. Commissioner Ritter seconded, motion carries (4 ayes, Commissioners 
Retzer, Ritter and Cassinelli; 0 nay; 3 absent, Commissioners Hendrix, Hardcastle and 
Lake) 
8.b. (for Possible Action) Robert & Janine Landstedt - Tentative Parcel Map -

there be 3 or 4 total. Mr. Pyzel stated there would be four total lots.

Staff Comments and Commissioner Comments- 
14.a. Staff update on recent County Commissioners actions 
Mr. Pyzel updated the Planning Commission on the Planning items that went before the 
Board of Commissioners at the March 5, 2020 meeting. The Sage Vista, Specific Plan 
application was denied. Commissioner Allan asked what the reason for denial was. Mr. 
Pyzel responded that the Commission felt the proposed future development was too 
densely populated, wanted more of the open space between Stagecoach and Dayton to 
remain as such and felt as though the lot sizes were too small.  
County Manager, Jeff Page encouraged the Planning Commission to get comfortable 
attending meetings via zoom. Moving forward they should expect this to be how the 
County will be doing business, at least for some time.  
14.b. Staff update on the proposed 2020 Comprehensive Master Plan   
Chris Baker, Manhard consultant, went over the process, timeline and goals of updating 
the 2020 Comprehensive Master Plan. The 2020 Comprehensive Mater Plan will be an 
update of the 2010 Comprehensive Master Plan. Reviewing and updating GIS data, land 
use maps, reviewing and updating goals, policies and strategies with staff’s 
6 
 
recommendations and incorporating community plans. Mr. Baker went over data collected 
at the community workshops for each community. He went on to say after the draft 
proposed Master Plan is completed it will go through another round of reviews for 
comments and recommendations in community meetings. As comments and

EXAMPLES OF FEEDBACK RECEIVED
Land Use, Economy and Growth
•
Start attracting commercial business, right now there are only plans for a lot industrial growth. We need more basic
businesses to turn from a commuter areas into full-service cities.
•
Require development to support diversified economic development by varying size and density of housing units.
Current developments appear to promote low income units, reducing the desirability of communities for higher
socioeconomic residents. High density housing does not promote strong community development.
•
This county doesn't need more jobs or to attract businesses. This county needs to stay rural in nature and respect
the current residents who wish to keep it that way. Rural areas are places to live, not places to develop and bring in
businesses.
Transportation
•
Provide expanded access to the southern development area (i.e. construction of additional bridge across river
course) to improve traffic flow, enhance distribution of environmental impact from increased usage, and ensure
public safety.
•
Public transportation is an absolute necessity and the lack of it creates many barriers for residents, particularly the
seniors and others in our communities who are unable to drive. Public transportation would provide access to
employment, health care, and other needed services in our county.
EXAMPLES OF FEEDBACK RECEIVED
Natural Resources and the Environment
•
Mining should be kept to a minimum and mining companies should be required to repair the damage they’ve done.
•
Need to address the county’s commitment to offsetting current and future effects from climate change, specifically
dealing with water/drought, weather impacts and energy generation.
Parks, Recreation and Open Space
•
I would like to see more open trails, and Dayton State Park needs to be protected.
•
Have a park, ball-field or playground that serves as the center of a community. The concept of a town with a park as
its center and focal point still has merit and appeal.
•
Wildlife reserves to preserve irreplaceable wild animals that are constantly pushed away by human development
Public Facilities and Services
•
The school district says it has plenty of funds, yet the water fountains are broken and the children have to pay for
drinkable water. The gates and fences are all well and good, but they don't work all the time. What good all that
money spent did, only to have the systems broken.
•
You can’t even keep up with the sewer now, let alone add more homes and yet you just approved 1,500 homes.
Where are the new schools, new fire department, and more police? None of that showed up in the master plan.
•
Domestic wells should be protected by the laws which were in effect when the property was purchased.
EXAMPLES OF FEEDBACK RECEIVED
Not Relevant To The Master Plan
•
Sewer rates are too high. My Carson City home is only $40.45 a month not $69 like Dayton. I may have to retire in
CC to save $400 a year in sewer fees. Cat food is$400 a year.
•
A general cleanup of some of the business and trailer park areas entering and leaving Dayton on 50. I've been
here a year and a half and have seen nothing done with the old Depot on the corner. That's a great area with a lot
of tourist potential.
Not Constructive
•
As always, the devil is in the details. That's where I'd like to have the discussion
•
DONT CRAP IN OUR BACKYARDS
•
This is not why we moved here. You are worthless idiots. In my humble opinion
•
Do not need, bla bla bla, Just words with no action mentioned, just hypothetical words
•
This is not what you said prior to election. Traitors...
•
This is sounding a lot like Communist California. Don't California my Nevada.

Staff Comments and Commissioner Comments- 
14.a. Staff update on recent County Commissioners actions 
Mr. Pyzel updated the Planning Commission on the Sage Vista, Specific Plan application 
that went before the Board of County Commissioners at the March 5, 2020 meeting and 
was denied. The applicant has filed for a judicial review. 
Chairwoman, Betty Retzer, asked Staff about the SCI (Summit Construction Inc.) 
Conditional Use Permit application that was continued from the April 14, 2020 meeting to 
the May 12, 2020. Planner, Rob Pyzel, stated that at the applicant’s request, it will be 
heard at the June 9, 2020 meeting. Planner, Tammy Kinsley, stated the applicant had a 
3 
 
roundtable with staff, Planners Rob Pyzel and Tammy Kinsley, Lyon County Road 
Department, Lyon County Utilities and Central Lyon County Fire Protection District on 
April 20, 2020. Staff reviewed each condition of approval to verify which conditions could 
be met prior to the issuance of a business license, after the issuance of a Business license 
or not at all. The applicant was asked to provide all requested materials by or before May 
1, 2020 in order to get on the May 12, 2020 agenda.  
On April 28, 2020 the applicant informed Mrs. Kinsley they would not be able to meet the 
deadline of May 1, 2020 to get on the May 12, 2020 agenda and requested a continuance 
to the June 9, 2020 Planning Commission meeting.  
Chairwoman, Retzer, asked staff if there was some kind of action that needed to be taken 
since the applicant’s original continuance was granted only to the May 12, 2020 meeting. 
Mr. Pyzel apologized for the oversight. The item should have been agendized for the 
Planning Commission to take action on another continuance. Since it was not agendized 
appropriately no action can be taken. Mr. Pyzel felt the best way to rectify the situation 
was to get a consensus from each Commissioner to make sure the Planning Commission 
understood this was an error on Staff’s part and agree that the application for SCI (Summit 
Construction Inc.) was being continued to the June 9, 2020 at the applicant’s request. All 
commissioners indicated they both understood and were okay with the continuance at the 
applicant’s request.  
Mr. Pyzel informed the Commission there would be an agenda item on the May 21, 2020 
Board of County Commissioners meeting asking them to approve a letter to address an 
ongoing complaint regarding the emissions and odor coming from the asphalt plant that 
borders the Carson City/ Lyon County line that will be sent to the Carson City Community 
Development Department, Board of Supervisors, NDEP Bureau of Air Pollution Control 
to address the complaints and work toward finding a solution.  
16. 
Public Participation 
John Covert- Thanked staff and Commissioners for their hard work, and patience and for 
continuing to work through everything as challenging as it is.

FINDINGS: 
A. The proposed parcel map conforms to the requirements set forth for the RR-1 (Rural Residential 1-
acre minimum) zoning district and for the CC (Community Commercial) zoning district as per Title 15 
of the Lyon County Code, or such requirements can be met with the imposition of reasonable 
conditions of approval. 
B. The proposed parcel map conforms to the requirements set forth in Title 15 of the Lyon County Code 
or such requirements can be met with the imposition of reasonable conditions of approval. 
 
Conditions of Approval: 
1. The applicant shall comply with all Federal, State, County and special purpose district regulations.

as necessary to insure an adequate water supply for proposed Parcels C1, C2, C3, and C4 for 
residential and commercial use on the newly created parcels, prior to recordation of the final parcel 
map. 
3. The developer shall provide written evidence demonstrating that the proposed parcels are able to be 
served by municipal water (City of Yerington) prior to recording a final parcel map.  
4. The applicant shall make corrections of any engineering or drafting errors and other technical map 
corrections to the satisfaction of the County Engineer and Planning Director prior to submitting the 
final parcel map for recordation. 
5. The applicant shall pay the actual costs for the County Engineer plan and map checking and County 
Inspector site improvement inspection fees, in accordance with the adopted County fee resolution in 
effect at the time, and provide proof of payment to the Planning Department prior to final parcel map 
recordation.  
6. The applicant shall comply with Lyon County’s 1996 drainage guidelines, as revised September

12. NDOT comments and conditions: 
a. Some of the proposed parcels are adjacent to Highway 95A. Highway 95A is a state-    
maintained road officially designated as US-95 Alternate (US-95A) and functionally  
classified as a rural minor arterial. 
b. NDOT requires the use of only legal, permitted accesses onto State roadways. The  
application states that legal access to the parcels is provided from Nadel Lane and Cheryl 
Lane, which have lower functional classifications than US-95A. NDOT’s 2017 Access 
Management System and Standards encourages providing access from roads with lower 
functional classifications. 
c. While direct access to US-95A is not proposed at this time, the applicant may be  
required to provide a traffic impact study to determine the impacts of any new development to 
the state highway system and any required mitigation strategies, if warranted by the scope of 
the final project. 
d. Prior to any grading within or adjacent to the NDOT right of way, a drainage form must  
be submitted to the NDOT District II Permits Office. The drainage form can be obtained by 
contacting the NDOT District II Permits Office at (775) 834-8330. 
e. NDOT will require an occupancy permit if any improvements are proposed within the   
State’s right of way. Please contact the NDOT District II Permits Office at (775) 834-8330 for 
more information relating to obtaining occupancy permits. 
f. 
The State defers to municipal government for land use development decisions. Public  
involvement for community development related improvements within NDOT right of way should 
be considered during the municipal land use development process. Significant improvements 
proposed within NDOT right of way may require additional public involvement. It is the 
responsibility of the applicant to perform such additional public involvement. 
 
13. The following items are required of all development: 
a. 
All construction shall comply with all applicable building and fire code requirements. 
b. 
Building permits shall be issued in compliance with Title 15 of the Lyon County Code. 
c. 
Site development work will require a grading permit(s) in accordance with Title 15.02.01. 
d. 
Structures placed on these parcels shall adhere to the County’s site and setback standards for   
 
the RR-1 and CC zoning district as it applies to each parcel at the time of development. 
e. 
Distinct and legible “temporary” addresses are required of any structures under construction  
 
until such time as permanent address numbers are installed and posted. 
f. 
All debris on construction sites must be contained and removed periodically as required for  
 
safety and cleanliness to the satisfaction of the Lyon County Building Department. 
g. 
Prior to any combustible materials being brought on site street name signage shall be installed,  
         if applicable. 
14. The final parcel map shall show the boundary of the AO D1 special flood hazard area on parcel C2 of 
the map and include the AO D1 special flood hazard area, with the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map 
number and date of the FIRM in the notes section on the final map. 
15. Any future development and improvements on proposed parcel C2 will be required to meet Title 
 15.800, FEMA, and NFIP requirements for development of that portion of the parcel that is located   
  within the special flood hazard area. 
16. Any future land division map applications for proposed parcel C2 will be required to resolve the "Split 
Zoning" of the 23.24 acre portion of RR-1 and the 10.84 acre portion of CC zoning on this parcel; as 
9
Page 4 of 15 
Planning Commission Public Hearing – June 9 2020 
Study Honey Holdings, LLC Yerington – Tentative Parcel Map 
Planning-tk 
 
Lyon County does not want to perpetuate the continuation of allowing split zoning on one parcel. 
Therefore any future parcel maps shall have the 23.24 acre portion of RR-1 zoning on one parcel and 
the 10.84 acre portion of CC zoning on a separate parcel. 
17. The applicant shall pay in full all property taxes through the end of the fiscal year (June 30) and any 
applicable agricultural deferred taxes prior to recordation of the final parcel map. 
18. The applicant shall pay required recording fees at time of final parcel map recordation. 
19. Any further division may be subject to the imposition of subdivision improvement standards as may 
be legally imposed at the time. The applicant shall place a note to this effect on the final parcel map 
prior to recordation 
20. The applicant shall provide the final parcel map to the Lyon County GIS Coordinator in form and 
format compatible with the County geographical information system (GIS). The scale of the site plan, 
improvements, monuments and other items shall be in model space correctly oriented to coordinate 
system as established by the GIS Coordinator. Cover sheet and standard details need not be 
included. 
21. Approval of the tentative parcel map shall not constitute acceptance of the final parcel map.  
Approval of the tentative parcel map shall lapse unless a final parcel map based thereon is 
submitted within two (2) years from the date of such approval.  No extension may be granted 
after receiving approval of the tentative parcel map.

Flood Zone:  
 
The subject parcel is located within the X-Unshaded Flood Zone and the AO D1 Special Flood Hazard 
Area (SFHA), as per FEMA FIRM Panel 32019C0750E dated January 16, 2009. Any future development 
and improvements on proposed parcel C2 will be required to meet Title 15.800, FEMA, and NFIP 
requirements for development of that portion of the parcel that is located within the special flood hazard 
area.

Topography: 
The subject site is relatively flat. Hwy 95A dissects the northern portion of the subject site. There 
is a portion of the northwestern corner of the parcel that is located in the AO D1 flood zone, 
which stems from an historic alluvial fan flooding occurrence, east of the project site above Hwy 
95A.   
 
Water:  
There is an 8-inch domestic water line located within the Nadel Road right-of-way within the 
subject site. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sewer:  
There are no sewer improvements in this area of Lyon County, therefore the developer will be required to 
provide Individual Sewage Disposal Systems for each parcel at the time of development as per the State 
of Nevada NAC 444, and meet all requirements of the State NDEP for septic system installation and 
construction. 
 
 
Traffic: 
This tentative parcel map is proposing four parcels, therefore it is anticipated that the number of traffic 
generated trips does not meet or exceed the County’s requirement for a Traffic Study with this tentative 
parcel map application. 
 
NDOT did provide comments and conditions regarding the portion of proposed Parcel C2 that is located 
on the north side and south side of HWY 95A regarding access and any improvements on this portion of 
HWY 95A. Staff has provided conditions to this tentative parcel map regarding these NDOT comments.

Telephone service will be provided by Frontier Telephone Company. There is no natural gas service 
provider to this area, therefore any gas service will be required to use a propane company for such 
services. 
 
Background: 
Per the applicant’s Justification and Narrative letter received March 31, 2020, the subject site was 
created through a Boundary Line Adjustment map in 2014. Specifically BLA Doc #537454 (see below).  
Previous to the BLA application, on December 5, 2013 the Lyon County Board of Commissioners 
approved a Zone Change request, on then parcel number 14-541-09, creating the split zoning of a 10.24 
acre portion of C-2 (General Commercial) and a 104.38 acre portion of RR-1 (Rural Residential – one 
acre minimum) on the parcel. (See Exhibit below) 
The owners of the subject site, adjusted the parcel to its present configuration of 108.49 acres to 
accommodate future development of 1.0 acre parcels for residential development as the parcels have 
access from Nadel Lane and water facilities available for development; and then commercial 
development along Hwy 95A.

Staff Review and Comments: 
Zoning: 
The subject site is currently zoned RR-1 First Rural Residential (1 Acre) under Title 10/ RR-1 (Rural 
Residential 1-acre minimum) under Title 15 and C-2 (General Commercial) under Title 10/ CC 
(Community Commercial) under current Title 15.  
The resulting parcels proposed as: 
C1 = 72.71 acres (RR-1); 
C2 = 33.48 acres (10.24 acres of C-2/CC and 23.24 acres of RR-1); 
C3 = 43,560 sq. ft. (1 acre) (RR-1) and; 
C4 = 43,560 sq. ft. (1 acre) (RR-1) 
 
created through the proposed parcel map are in compliance with the existing zoning district’s minimum 
parcel size requirements for the RR1 and CC zoning districts.   
 
Master Plan: 
The subject site is currently within the “Future Planning Area” master plan Land Use designation. 
Per the 2010 Lyon County Master Plan: 
“The Future Planning Areas designated on the County-wide Land Use Plan are 
 locations where future development may occur but where additional planning is  
necessary because of large common ownership, topography, infrastructure and  
16
Page 11 of 15 
Planning Commission Public Hearing – June 9 2020 
Study Honey Holdings, LLC Yerington – Tentative Parcel Map 
Planning-tk 
 
other factors. These are places where a master plan may have designations  
that are different than the existing land use designations. One area to be considered 
initially is: (1) Mason Valley/east of Yerington.” 
 
“1. Mason Valley/East of Yerington  
The Future Planning Area East of Yerington is a location where future municipal  
services will be available (sewer and water). Most of the zoning currently allows  
for agriculture and very low density development. Developing a plan for the  
area may entail collaborative planning with the City of Yerington and citizens.  
Future development of this area should have suburban densities appropriate 
           for municipal services.” 
 
As stated above in staff’s report, the subject site is located east of Yerington, where current water service 
infrastructure is in place, through the City of Yerington, to serve the proposed four parcels. Access to the 
subject site is also in place as Nadel Lane.  Therefore, this tentative parcel map application meets the 
requirements of the Master Plan.

Improvement Requirements and Water Rights Dedication: 
The proposed parcel map must meet the minimum discretionary requirements and mandatory water 
rights requirements set forth in Lyon County Code (“LCC”) Section 15.600.05 – Requirements: 
Mandatory Water Rights Dedication or Relinquishment Requirements are as follows: 
All maps of land division, including parcel maps, subdivision maps and maps of division of land into large 
parcels, must dedicate or relinquish water rights as follows: 
1.   If the land encompassed by any map of land division is not within the existing boundaries of a public 
water system as defined in NRS 445A and the newly created parcels are to be served by domestic 
well: 
a.   The land divider shall relinquish to the state engineer water rights necessary to ensure an 
adequate water supply for domestic use of the newly created parcels from within the water 
basin in which the parcel is located; and 
b.   The land divider shall bear all costs associated with such relinquishment; and 
c.   For purposes of this section, valid underground water rights in the amount of 2.0 acre-feet per 
year shall be relinquished for each new parcel created by the land division; and 
d.   No map of land division shall be recorded until the requirements of this section have been 
satisfied. 
2.    If the land encompassed by any map of land division is within the boundaries of, or will be served by 
a public water system as defined in NRS 445A: 
a.   The dedication or relinquishment of water rights necessary to ensure an adequate supply for 
the domestic use of the newly created parcels shall follow the rules and requirements of that 
system, or a written statement from the water system that no dedication or relinquishment 
requirement exists, or that dedication or relinquishment requirements have been satisfied, 
must be submitted before a map may be recorded; and 
b.   The land divider shall bear all costs associated with such relinquishment; and 
c.    For the purpose of this section, necessary water rights required shall be determined by the 
rules and requirements of the water system. 
3.    If a land division map is created on land subject to a conservation or agricultural easement meeting 
the requirements of section 170(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, the requirements for dedication or 
relinquishment of water rights enumerated in paragraphs 1 and 2 above may be waived by the board 
for those portions of the land division map subject to the easement when the following findings can 
be made: 
a.    The conservation or agricultural easement creates a perpetual restriction on development 
of the parcel(s) for residential use; and 
b.   The conservation or agricultural easement is held by a qualified land protection 
organization; and 
18
Page 13 of 15 
Planning Commission Public Hearing – June 9 2020 
Study Honey Holdings, LLC Yerington – Tentative Parcel Map 
Planning-tk 
 
c.    The conservation or agricultural easement document conforms to the requirements of 
15.340.A.5.e. 
LCC Chapter 15.600.05 sets out the mandatory and discretionary requirements for Parcel Maps.  County 
Code and Nevada Revised Statutes permits the imposition of reasonable requirements as part of the 
approval of a parcel map. The subject site is located within the existing boundaries of a municipal or 
private water system – City of Yerington.   
Documentation of the water rights relinquishment for the proposed Parcel B1, B2, B3, and B4 would be 
required prior to recordation of the final parcel map.  
Access: 
Lyon County code requires a minimum road easement width of 50 feet with an improved section of not 
more than 36 feet in width if the local road has the future potential to provide access for more than forty 
(40) lots.  
With this Tentative Parcel Map the applicant is proposing to dedicate the westerly 30-foot of Right-of-way 
on Nadel Lane in order to create a 60-foot Right-of-way, along the frontage on Nadel Lane of the 
proposed parcels C2, C3 and C4 and for a portion of parcel C1 at the intersection of Nadel Lane at 
Devera Lane.  
The applicant is proposing to dedicate a 50-foot wide road as Cheryl Lane for access to proposed parcel 
C1 to the south of the parcel.  
Proposed parcel C2 splits Hwy 95A with portions of the parcel on the north side and the south side of 
Hwy 95A.  On this proposed parcel C2 the applicant has provided a “call-out” of HWY 95A as a “100.00’ 
width N.D.O.T. easement not a dedicated right-of-way” with this map. The Nevada Division of 
Transportation (NDOT) provided comments and conditions on May 1, 2020 via email, that staff has 
added as conditions to this tentative parcel map (PLZ-20-0009). Please see below:  
a. Some of the proposed parcels are adjacent to Highway 95A. Highway 95A is a state-    
maintained road officially designated as US-95 Alternate (US-95A) and functionally  
classified as a rural minor arterial. 
b. NDOT requires the use of only legal, permitted accesses onto State roadways. The  
application states that legal access to the parcels is provided from Nadel Lane and Cheryl 
Lane, which have lower functional classifications than US-95A. NDOT’s 2017 Access 
Management System and Standards encourages providing access from roads with lower 
functional classifications. 
c. While direct access to US-95A is not proposed at this time, the applicant may be  
required to provide a traffic impact study to determine the impacts of any new development to 
the state highway system and any required mitigation strategies, if warranted by the scope of 
the final project. 
d. Prior to any grading within or adjacent to the NDOT right of way, a drainage form must  
be submitted to the NDOT District II Permits Office. The drainage form can be obtained by 
contacting the NDOT District II Permits Office at (775) 834-8330. 
e. NDOT will require an occupancy permit if any improvements are proposed within the   
State’s right of way. Please contact the NDOT District II Permits Office at (775) 834-8330 for 
more information relating to obtaining occupancy permits. 
f. 
The State defers to municipal government for land use development decisions. Public  
involvement for community development related improvements within NDOT right of way should 
be considered during the municipal land use development process. Significant improvements 
proposed within NDOT right of way may require additional public involvement. It is the 
responsibility of the applicant to perform such additional public involvement.

Fire Protection: 
The property is within the Mason Valley Fire Protection District (MVFPD).  
 
Public Utility Easements: 
Lyon County’s current standard for public utility easements (“PUEs”) requires a minimum 7.5-foot 
utility easement in the front yard of a parcel and a minimum 5-foot utility easement along all other 
property lines.  Per Document No 503239 there is an existing 10-foot wide water line easement 
along the parcel frontage (Nadel Lane) for the existing water line infrastructure. There is also an 
existing 50-foot wide water line easement located in Cheryl Lane, as per Doc#503439. 
 
Water Supply and Sewer Service: 
As noted above, the subject site can readily be served by the City of Yerington for domestic water 
service, as the applicant has provided a “Will Serve’ letter from the city.  There is no domestic sewer 
service in this area for sewer service therefore the developer will be required to provide Individual 
Sewage Disposal Systems for each parcel at the time of development as per the State of Nevada NAC 
444. 
 
Drainage: 
Per the applicant’s response for the requirement of a drainage report and geotechnical report, there 
are no existing drainage(s) identified on the subject site. No development or construction is 
proposed with this tentative parcel map application, As such, staff is of the opinion that the drainage 
of the subject site and surrounding properties has been considered by the applicant and will be 
dealt with as the subject site develops and may require a Drainage Report, prepared by a licensed 
Engineer and a Geotechnical Report, prepared by a Geotechnical Engineer.  
The subject site is relatively flat. Hwy 95A dissects the northern portion of the subject site. There 
is a portion of the northwestern corner of the parcel that is located in the AO D1 flood zone, 
which stems from an historic alluvial fan flooding occurrence, east of the project site above Hwy 
95A.  Therefore, as stated previously in the staff report the subject parcel is located within the X-
Unshaded Flood Zone and the AO D1 Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), as per FEMA FIRM Panel 
32019C0750E dated January 16, 2009. Any future development and improvements on proposed parcel 
C2 will be required to meet Title 15.800, FEMA, and NFIP requirements for development of that portion 
of the parcel that is located within the special flood hazard area.

PLZ-20-0004 VIKSNA CUP 
 
RECENT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
At the April 14th, 2020 Planning Commission hearing, the Planning Commission and the 
applicant agreed to continue their CUP application to the May 12th, 2020 Planning Commission 
meeting, in order for the applicant to meet with County staff and reviewing agencies to review the 
Conditions of PLZ-20-0004 for a Conditional Use Permit. To review and verify what conditions 
the applicant could meet prior to the issuance of a Business License, after the issuance of a 
Business license or not at all. 
During the April 20, 2020 Round Table meeting (please see attached Round Table meeting 
notes), which was held via the ZOOM meeting platform, planning staff read aloud, each condition 
and the applicant responded accordingly to each condition. At that meeting the applicants, Erik 
and Julie Viksna stated that they would provide a revised site plan and a revised description of 
the project, in order to move forward to the May 12, 2020 Planning Commission meeting. Staff

GENERAL INFORMATION: 
The applicants, Erik an Julie Viksna of Summit Contractors, Inc., are proposing to construct and establish 
a commercial landscape material yard for sales to the public on an approximately 1.51 acre parcel 
located at 7013 E. HWY 50, in Dayton (Mark Twain) NV; APN: 019-192-05.  
On January 3, 2020 the Lyon County Board of Commissioners approved the request to change the 
zoning district of C-2 (General Commercial under Title 10)/ CC (Community Commercial under Title 15) 
to the LI-S (Light Industrial – Suburban) Title 15 zoning district. 
The applicants submitted a revised site plan and revised project description, via email on May 26, 2020. 
(Please see below)  
 
The applicants are proposing the hours of operation as 8:00am to 5:00pm, seven days a week. The type 
of landscape materials proposed for sale are rock, gravel, DG, sand, barks, and top soil. They plan to 
conduct a majority of their business via phone. The applicants plan to dispense the landscape materials 
via small delivery loads off-site to their customers. They will not be dispensing their products from this 
project site, as they are proposing no walk-in clients and no employees at this time.  
There is no exterior lighting proposed and the site is currently fenced completely around the perimeter of 
the property.  Access to the site is from the Frontage Road along Hwy 50 via an existing 30-foot gated 
access.  The applicants are proposing the required 10-foot landscape buffer, on their property, along the 
frontage road property line, within the fenced area. They are also proposing six parking spaces and an

Access: 
Access to the subject site is located from the east side of Frontage Road via an existing 30-foot wide 
access with existing gate. The Lyon County Roads Director has provided conditions for the required 
improvements for the commercial access to the proposed business, as “The applicant is required to 
apply for a commercial encroachment permit with the Lyon County Road Department. The project site is 
required to have a paved approach onto the Frontage Road for the proposed commercial landscape 
material yard for sales to the public.” 
 
Topography: 
The subject site is relatively flat with a natural drainage, flow line, feature that crosses the southwest 
corner of the parcel.  
The project shall meet the “Drainage Guidelines for Lyon County” revised Sept. 20, 2018; The applicants 
are required to submit a drainage report analyzing the existing drainage ditch along the southeastern 
corner of the property and are to describe in the drainage report how site modifications will not impact the 
adjacent property owner.

Water and Sewer: 
There are existing Lyon County Utility water and sewer lines, approximately 350 feet, to the east within 
the S. Pinenut Drive right-of-way. The LCUD did provide comments and conditions regarding water and 
sewer service to this site as, “This property is not currently served by Lyon County Utility Department 
(LCUD). Any proposed connections to LCUD water or sewer will require a Utilities Permit Application.  
Any proposed water or sewer connections to LCUD may also require authorization from the Nevada 
Division of Environmental Protection for sewer service. 
If the applicants are proposing to use the existing well for anything other than a residential use, then the 
applicants are required to purchase water rights to apply the water rights to the existing well.  
The applicants will need to check with the State Division of Water Resources (DWR), to verify what kind 
of well is on the property, a domestic well or a commercial well. A domestic well cannot be used for a 
commercial use. 
Further review by the applicants will be needed in order to determine whether Lyon County Utility 
Department will allow the applicants to use the current well or have the project site connect to the LCUD 
system for water and sewer service.”
