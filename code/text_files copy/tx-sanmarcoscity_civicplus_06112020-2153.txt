Background Information:
Council Member Baker seeks support from City Council regarding the proposed letter to Governor Abbbott.
The letter is below:
Gov. Abbott:
The large majority of those who have been hospitalized by COVID-19 are people of color and low-income
populations. Public health experts have confirmed that this is mainly because Latinx and people of color are
overwhelmingly working on the front lines. Inaction to protect our frontline workers will result in predictable
consequences, including loss of life. Our local democracies are trying to take every action allowable under the
law to address this reality. Clearly, it is necessary for the state to take action as well. We are calling on you to
address the disproportionate impact this virus has on Latinx Texans.
We call on you to:
1. Expand Medicaid. Texas is the most uninsured state in America. The Latinx community lacks health
insurance more than any other major population in Texas. It is disturbing that you continue to refuse these
federal health care dollars during the COVID crisis.
2. Have the Attorney General drop the lawsuit that is blocking paid sick time policies. Paid sick time would be
guaranteed for all workers in Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio if it were not for the state’s lawsuit. Paid sick time
is more important now, than ever.
3. Use the Economic Stabilization Fund (a.k.a. Rainy Day Fund) to provide immediate and continued financial
relief to working class families, regardless of immigration status. Doing so will lead to fewer people being
forced to return to work if they are vulnerable or at-risk.
4. Nullify SB4, the “Show Me Your Papers” law. Because of your law, many immigrants are too afraid to seek
critical medical interventions or public assistance for fear of being separated from their families
5. Support Texas municipalities efforts to manage the Covid crisis. There is no “one size fits all” solution,
municipalities should be permitted to enforce CDC guidelines and emergency protocols that will most protect
and benefit their unique situations and constituents, which for San Marcos includes a large percentage of

Latinx and low income households. We must be supported in our efforts to save lives and prevent further
devastation to these communities.
We have taken several steps at the local level to alleviate some of the economic burden faced by our citizens.
However, there are many things outlined above that only you can legislate to help our community and they
require your full and absolute attention. Inaction on protecting people of color or those that are low-income
from COVID-19 is an affirmative decision to perpetuate racial and class injustice. It is a decision that will cost
lives. We eagerly await your response.
