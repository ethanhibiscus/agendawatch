SUBJECT/PROCEEDING: 
Discussion and possible action regarding residential fee schedule 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION: 
City Council has prior discussed construction fees for residential additions.  Proposed residential construction fees are 
as outlined below. All residential fees are paid by the general contractor at the time an application is submitted and 
includes all sub-contractors fees, plan review, and inspections. 
• 
New residential homes: $300 plus $0.55 per square foot of air conditioned space (plus digital plan review fee 
and digitizing plans fee is applicable) 
• 
Residential pool greater than $100,000: $300 plus digital review and digitizing fees for pools greater than 
$100,000. 
• 
Residential pool less than $100,000:  No Fee 
• 
All Residential Remodels, All Residential Additions, and independent trade permits: No Fee 
Language was added to page 2 of the fee schedule clarifying what an addition is. It reads “Additions are defined as 
construction, which adds new air conditioned space to an existing property which has been issued a Certificate of 
Occupancy”.  In cases where properties are under construction by the builder and a certificate of occupancy has not yet 
been issued, if they modify plans to add additional air conditioned space, these would not be considered residential 
additions. In that case, the property is subject to permit fees (plan revision fees and the difference in permit cost based 
on the added square footage). 
 
Council Member McLeod has provided an alternate proposal for residential additions for consideration. In this case, fees 
for residential additions would be based upon years since issuance of a certificate of occupancy of the home and 
consideration of air conditioned space to be added. Those fees would be structed as follows: 
Residential Additions adding 25% or more of existing square footage and issued a certificate of occupancy within the 
last 5 years: 
• 
Building Permit (includes all sub-contractors fees, plan review, and inspections) - $300.00 plus $0.55 per square 
foot of air conditioned space.

Residential Additions adding less than 25% of existing square footage or properties not issued a certificate of 
occupancy within the last 5 years:

Notes:  All permits shall be on display at the site of the project prior to any work being started.  If a permit is not on display at the 
site or a permit has not been attained, the individual/contractor doing the work may incur an investigation fee of $250.00 for the 
first offense and each additional infraction will increase to $1,000.00. If a fire permit is not on display at the site or a permit has 
not been attained, the individual/contractor doing the work may incur an investigation fee of ½ of the original permit fee. This fee 
is in addition to any permit fees or criminal charges.  If it has been determined that work has been done prior to pulling the permit 
the contractor must cease doing any further work until a permit has been issued unless it has been determined by the  Building 
Official that it is an emergency situation. 
 
If the contractor’s declared building permit valuations appear unreasonably low staff can use International Code Council’s (ICC) 
most current valuation table to verify accuracy of declared value.  If the declared building permits value is 10% less than the 
ICC’s determined value then staff can use the ICC value instead or staff can request the contractor to provide the bid to verify the 
declared amount. 
 
If building plans have been approved any additional plan sheets submitted after approval will require the Additional Plan Review 
fee of $500.00 for the first review each additional review will increase by $250.00 . 
After hour inspections must be scheduled 72 hours in advance and must be cancelled 24 hours prior to inspection to avoid any 
penalties. The rate for the 1st hour is $300.00 each additional half hour is $150.00 each inspection is a one hour minimum. Fire 
after hour inspections must be scheduled 72 hours in advance and must be cancelled 24 hours prior to inspection to avoid any 
penalties. The after hour inspection rate is $500 per fire inspection. 
 
Inspections must be cancelled by 8:30 a.m. the day of the inspection request in order to have the inspection cancelled.  If the 
request is not cancelled by 8:30 a.m. fees will occur. 
 
 
If an inspection fails and the re-inspection fee is applied that fee must be paid prior to receiving any further inspections.  
 
**The fee for site work permits are included in the building permit if the plans are submitted with the building plans as on 
combined submission. If the plans are submitted separately the fees for the building permit and site work permits will be charged 
separately and in their full amounts.
