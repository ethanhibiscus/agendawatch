Memorandum 
To: 
Honorable Mayor, City Council, and City Manager 
From: 
Chad William.~. Chief of Police 
Date: 
May 5, 2020 
Subject: 
Permission to Seek Criminal Justice Division Grant 
The Big Spring Police Department is seeking permission to seek a grant through the Office of the 
Governor, Criminal Justice Division for Coronavirns Emergency Supplemental Funding (CESF) Progrom, 
FY2020: This is a 0% match grant for the City of 
Big Spring. 
The purpose of this grant is to solicit funds for personnel protective equipment (PPE) and supplies (i.e. 
gloves, masks, sanitizer and disinfectant) to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the corona 
virus. This 
equipment will be available and disu·ibuted to our first responders to include the Big Spring Police 
Department, Howard County Sheriff's Office and Detention Center and Big Spring Fire Department and 
EMS. In most cases when a crisis occurs, Emergency Management has the ability to obtain excess 
supplies and equipment from within our region, but due to COVID-19 affecting all entities throughout the 
country, this "stockpile" has been diminished. We are asking to be considered for approximately 
$35,000.00 worth of 
equipment and supplies to establish their availability for future needs. 
Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.
