7.    PUBLIC HEARING 
 
Petition #20-05-01. City-initiated petition to discus and consider Text Amendments to Title IV, Land 
Use, pertaining to the following: (1) supermajority zoning approval requirements, and (2) massage 
therapy regulations/day spa accessory uses. 
 
Chairman Boggs opened the Public Hearing 
 
Assistant City Attorney, Parnell read the Exhibit List.

Exhibit 2

Exhibit 7 
Draft Ordinance Amending Sections 400.150, 400.180, 400.185, 405.100 and 
405.110 
Exhibit 8 
Draft Ordinance Amending Sections 400.090 and 400.335 
 
Planner Hood stated that this Text Amendment pertaining to the Super Majority is at the request of the 
Planning and Zoning Commission.  It allows, with a 2/3 vote, the Planning and Zoning Commission to deem 
specific conditions as necessary, which would then require a super majority at the City Council level to  
modify or delete them.  The second Text Amendment revises the definition of massage and added 
provisions under which massage services can be offered by non-medical licensed businesses as 
accessory.  Must be accessory to the primary use which can be determined by the City Manager.  
Commissioner Compton asked Planner Hood the reasoning behind available for purchase to general public.  
Hood stated that because it is being administered by non-licensed personal, it must be useable by 
everyone. Commissioner Ellebrecht stated that the super majority item seems a little open ended and 
suggested possibly limiting the necessary conditions to one per item on the agenda. Commissioner 
Compton agrees there needs to be limitations but isn’t sure 1 per item is the answer. Commissioner 
Ellebrecht questioned making it a unanimous vote at the Planning and Zoning level. Commissioner Gupta 
disagreed with unanimous. Commissioner Niebling stated that if a super majority is being required at the 
City Council level then it should be required at the Planning and Zoning level as well.  She also suggested 
creating a public record that communicates to the City Council the reasoning of any negative 
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Commissioner Bengston agreed with this idea. 
Commissioner Gupta would like to see the City Council send things back to Planning and Zoning that they 
disagree with giving the opportunity for dialogue and  to work together to get things approved.  
Commissioner Ellebrecht voiced concerns about items going back and forth and being held up between the 
City Council and Planning and Zoning. 
 
Commissioner Compton moved to forward a positive recommendation to the City Council as outlined in the 
attached exhibits.  The motion was seconded by Commissioner Gupta.  The votes were as follows:

Planner Hood stated that this is an application for a conditional use permit to allow the use of a leg compression 
device in connection with their business.  The  request is being processed concurrently with the City’s petition 
for the text amendment to allow such uses.  This is only to be used if the text amendment is approved.

9. DISCUSSION 
 
 
Medical Marijuana Comparison Table (Ballwin-Ellisville) 
 
 
Planner Hood stated that there was some concern from the last meeting that Ballwin may have more robust 
regulations than Ellisville.  Assistant City, Parnell, stated that the State is the primary regulator and that we 
cannot create harsher regulations than the State.  These type of businesses should be treated as a pharmacy. 
Commissioner Bengtson pointed out that we are less restrictive than the State when it comes to the distance 
from schools and churches and that the daycares were completely eliminated. Commissioner Niebling stated 
that she thinks Ellisville did a good job on this one.

Memo 
To: 
Chairman Rob Compto~ai 
Members of 
the Planning and Zoning Commission 
From: Ada Hood, City Planne 
Meeting 
Date: 
June 10, 2020 
Re: 
Petition of 
Cape Dogwood 573 LLC d/b/a Dogwood Social House for a conditional use 
permit to allow the operation of 
a retail beverage and retail entertainment establishment with 
the sale of 
liquor at the location known and numbered as 15682 Manchester Road within the 
C-3 Commercial Zoning District. 
SUMMARY 
The applicant is requesting approval of 
a Conditional Use Permit to authorize the issuance of 
a liquor license and allow the operation of 
a retail beverage and retail entertainment 
establishment at 15682 Manchester Road. 
Conditionally permitted uses are deemed permitted but have been identified as featuring 
specific aspects which may result in negative impacts to adjoining uses, traffic, environment, 
etc. It is the intention of 
the conditional use permit process to identify the negative impacts and 
mitigate such impacts. 
The Zoning Code establishes the following criteria for conditional uses: 
1. 
It shall be the responsibility of 
the applicant to clearly establish that the following criteria are 
met: 
a. 
The use will not have any negative effect upon traffic conditions. 
(1) In the event that the proposed commercial use or building is a motor vehicle oriented 
business as defined by Section 400.430(A)(2), traffic impact consideration screening 
procedures as set forth in Section 400.430(A)(4) shall be considered by the Council in 
determining whether there is a negative effect upon traffic conditions, in addition to any 
other evidence adduced pursuant to the permit procedure. 
b. 
The use will not substantially increase fire hazards. 
c. 
The use will not adversely affect the character of 
the neighborhood. 
d. 
The use will not adversely affect the general welfare of 
the community.

e. 
The use will not overtax the sewage or public utilities. 
f. 
The use will not adversely affect or overtax Police or other City services. 
g. 
The use will be the highest and best use of 
the location applied for. 
h. 
The use will not adversely affect the financial condition of the City including any adverse 
impact upon utilities, property and sales tax. 
i. 
The use will not have a substantial negative impact on the environment. 
J. The proposed use is compatible with surrounding uses and with the surrounding neighborhood. 
k. The comparative size, floor area and mass of the proposed use and/or proposed structure are 
appropriate and reasonable in relation to adjacent structures and buildings on surrounding 
properties and in the surrounding neighborhood. 
1. 
The proposed use will not adversely affect the neighborhood in terms of water runoff, noise 
transfer or heat generation due to significant amount of hard surfaced areas for buildings, 
sidewalk, drives, parking and service areas. 
m. 
The frequency and duration of various indoor and outdoor activities and special events 
associated with the proposed use will not have a deleterious impact on the surrounding area. 
n. 
The proposed use is likely to remain in existence for a reasonable length of time and not 
become vacant or unused and whether such use involves the presence of unusual, single-
purpose structures or components of a temporary nature. 
o. 
The proposed use complies with the standards of 
good planning practices. 
p. Where a proposed use has the potential for adverse impacts, sufficient measures have been or 
will be taken by the applicant that would negate, to an acceptable level, such potentially 
adverse impacts, as determined by the City Council. 
q. The use will comply with all other applicable provisions of 
this Chapter including performance 
standards as set forth in Section 400.170. 
Additionally, Section 600.030 of the Municipal Code pertains to liquor licenses and requires that 
liquor sales shall occur in association with the sale of other non-alcoholic goods having a value 
according to invoices of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The business is primarily a 
restaurant with outdoor dining, and incidental liquor sales. It is anticipated the sale of non-
alcoholic item will exceed the minimum requirement of $1,000.00. 
Additionally, as per Section 600.035, "No license shall be granted for the sale of intoxicating 
liquor, as defined in this Chapter, within one hundred (100) feet of any school, church or other 
building regularly used as a place of religious worship, unless the applicant for the license shall 
first obtain the consent in writing of 
the City Council, except that when a school, church or place 
of worship shall hereafter be established within one hundred (100) feet of any place of business 
licensed to sell intoxicating liquor, the license shall not be denied for this reason. Such consent 
shall not be granted until at least ten (10) days' written notice has been provided to all owners of 
• Page2 
June 2, 2020 
June 10, 2020 Planning and Zoning Commission Packet
Page 12 of 37
property within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed licensed premises." The proposed use is 
not within 100 feet of such uses. 
IMPACT 
As the shopping center was recently renovated and brought into compliance with landscaping, 
parking and sidewalk luminaires, staff did not perform any site inspections or believes any 
conditions of 
approval are required. 
The approval process requires a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
The Planning and Zoning Commission may choose to waive the public hearing at the 
Commission level. A public hearing is required at the City Council level. The City Council 
makes the decision on the application via ordinance. 
RECOMMENDATION 
Staff 
recommends that the Planning and Zoning Commission waives the public hearing at the 
Commission level as a public hearing will be held at the City Council level. Staff 
recommends the 
Commission forwards a positive recommendation.
