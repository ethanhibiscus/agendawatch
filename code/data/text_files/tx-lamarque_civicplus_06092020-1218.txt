Board Member Pennington wanted to know the size and height of the sign. Ms. 
Purnell noted that the only thing we are looking at is the placement location 
and the distance to the property lines.  
 
Board Member Jones wanted to know if they should get their permit first. Ms. 
Purnell said no because it would have to be denied as they have to go through 
the Board of Adjustments first for the placement location.

location and was worried that a digital sign would be distracting to drivers on 
this road.

Discussion/Possible action regarding a request for a commercial building set 
 
back variance to Section 71-20 – Schedule of district regulations requiring a 
 
Minimum Rear Yard setback of 10-feet and Side Yard setback of 5-feet for 
 
properties zoned Light Industrial (L-1) for Lot 14R of Block 59 of Division “K” 
 
Cook and Stewart Subdivision, a subdivision in Galveston County, Texas 
 
according to the map or plat thereof recorded in Galveston County Clerk’s File 
 
No. 2018013940 in the Official Public Records of Real Property of Galveston 
 
County, Texas. 
 
 
Staff addressed the Board and informed them that the two buildings are 
 
currently existing and the property is being subdivided for conveyance of one 
 
the lots. The required plat for conveyance is the trigger for the Board of 
 
Adjustments consideration of the building setback requirement variance 
 
request.   
 
  
The building on Lot 14 was constructed 4.1 feet from the back property lines 
 
many years ago and prior to building standards and the Zoning Code. The fact 
 
that the building is 4.1 foot from the property makes this property a non-
 
compliant zoned property. We have to consider the variance request so that 
 
once sold there will not be a “cloud” on the title at conveyance. 
 
 
You can only grant variance to the zoning ordinance when you have an 
 
unnecessary hardship that can’t be a financial hardship. In this case because 
 
they have existing buildings and they were there long before hand; if we don’t 
 
allow them to subdivide the property they won’t be able to sell the property 
 
off. Alternatively, they will have to look at picking up the buildings and moving 
 
them over. It is up to this board to see if this is an unnecessary hardship and 
 
you should grant them a variance under the zoning ordinance if you believe so. 
 
The Board members noted that this was a long time existing business who 
brings in sales tax and contributes to the city through charity work. 
 
Board Member Pennington motioned to grant a variance request for a 
commercial building set back variance to Section 71-20 – Schedule of district 
regulations requiring a Minimum Rear Yard setback of 10-feet and Side Yard

planning to publish at a later date.

request.

(5) allowing the operation of a group home on Lot 17, of Erickson Subdivision 
for a period of up to 90 days or the next scheduled Board meeting coinciding

Discussion Date:  June 9, 2020 
  
Approval Date:     
Submitted By:      Sussie Sutton 
 
SUBJECT:  
Consideration and possible action regarding request for a variance to the City Code of 
Zoning Ordinance Section 71-20 Schedule of District Regulations minimum side-building 
setback of 5-feet and front-building setback of 20-feet setback for residential homes 
located in an R-1 Single Family Residential area and allowing the conversion of a 
nonconforming commercial building use to a residential use of said building; to be 
allowed to permit and renovate the building located at 2402 Jackson, La Marque. 
 
DISCUSSION:  
In early May 2020, staff received an application to renovate the existing commercial 
building and convert it to a single family residential home. Upon review of the 
documentation it was found that the building did not meet the building set back 
requirements and the city codes to renovate and convert from a commercial to a family 
residential home. 
 
On May 15, 2020 staff received an application for variance to the building setbacks and 
to convert the commercial building to a single family residential home. 
 
This is a financial hardship to the owner as this building would have to be demolished 
to construct a residential home at this location in the event that this request is denied. 
The building is in good condition and could be renovated into a residence.  
 
  
RECOMMENDATION: The staff recommendation is to allow the approval of this request.

Security Interest created hereby and the resort to any remedy provided hereunder or provided by the 
Uniform Commercial Code ofTexas, or by any other law ofthe State ofTexas, shall not prevent the 
concurrent employment of 
any other appropriate remedy or remedies. 
The requirement of 
reasonable notice to Debtor of 
the time and place of 
any Public Sale of 
the Collateral, or ofthe time after which any Private Sale or any other intended disposition thereof 
is 
to be made, shall be met if 
such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor at the address ofDebtor,

release the Deed of 
Trust Lien securing the Collateral upon the full and final payment thereof to 
Secured Party, but Secured Party is under no obligation to make or enforce the collection of the 
Collateral and the failure of 
Secured Party from any cause to make or enforce the collection thereof 
shall not in any way prejudice the right of Secured Party to thereafter make or enforce collection 
thereof 
or in any way affect the indebtedness to Secured Party hereby secured. In the event Secured 
Party exercises its option to collect and receipt for sums becoming due on the Collateral, and the 
Collateral then is in default, Secured Party as Beneficiary of 
the Deed ofTrust Lien, pursuant to this 
agreement, may proceed with any right or remedy as provided in said Deed of Trust including 
requesting the Trustee named therein or Trustee's Successor or Substitute to sell the property 
described therein (and described above) as provided by said Deed ofTrust and Section 51.002 of 
the 
Texas Property Code, as then amended and otherwise complying with applicable law. Proceeds 
from such sale, after deducting reasonable expenses of 
sale shall first be applied toward payment of 
the Obligations and any other obligation or debt then due Secured Party by Debtor and the remainder 
thereon, if 
any, shall be paid to Debtor. Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiencies due on the 
Obligations. The recitals in any Trustee's Deed conveying said property shall be presumed to be true 
including the authority and rights of Secured Party as Beneficiary therein. In the event Secured 
Party does not exercise its option as stated in this paragraph and Debtor continues to collect and 
receipt for any and all sums becoming due upon the Collateral, Debtor may release the Deed ofT 
rust 
Lien upon the full and final payment thereon or, request Trustee or Trustee's Successor of 
the Deed 
of 
Trust to sell the property as provided therein. 
It is agreed that this agreement also secures Secured Party in the payment of any and all 
indebtedness now owing or hereafter to become owing by Debtor to Secured Party; provided, 
however, that this agreement shall not secure any indebtedness of 
Debtor to Secured Party which 
under any circumstances is prohibited by the Texas Finance Code or any other law, and the parties 
hereby agree that Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code shall not apply to this transaction. If 
default is made in the payment of 
any other indebtedness secured hereby, or if 
Debtor breaches any 
of the covenants contained in any lien or security interest securing such indebtedness, the 
indebtedness evidenced by the Obligations, at the option of 
the holder thereof, shall at once become 
due and payable. 
The pronouns used in this agreement are in the masculine gender but shall be construed as 
feminine or neuter as occasion may require. "Secured Party" and "Debtor" as used in this agreement 
include, shall bind and shall inure to the benefit of 
the respective heirs, executors or administrators, 
successors, representatives, receivers, trustee and assigns of 
such parties. If 
there be more than one 
Debtor, their obligations shall be joint and several.

pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower IIlllkes payment to

any which may attain priority over insurance), plus one-twelfth 
of yearly premium installments for mortgage :iruru:rance, if any, all as reasonably estimated initially and

Section 7. If 
Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly, pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails 
to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 7 and pay such 
amount and Borrower shall then be obligated !lllder Section 7 to repay Lender any such amount. Lender 
may revoke the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with 
Section 12 and, upoo such revocation, Borrower shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such. amounts, that

snch an institution). Lender shall apply the Funds to pay said Escrow Items. Lender shall not charge for so 
holding and applying the Funds, analyzing said account or verifying and compiling said assessments and 
bills unless Lender pays BoiiDWer interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such 
a charge. Borrower and Lender may agree in writing at the time of execution of 
this Deed of Trust that 
interest on the Funds shall be paid to Borrower, and unless such agreement is made or Applicable Law 
requires such interest to be paid, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earning on 
the Funds. Lender shall give to Borrower, without cha.:ge, an aonual accounting of the Funds showing 
credits and debits to the Funds and the piUJloSe for which each debit to the Funds was made. The Funds are 
pledged as additional security for the sums secured by this Deed of 
Trust

Funds

Escrow I 
terns as they fall due, such excess shall be, at Borrower's option, either promptly repaid to 
Borrower or credited to Borrower on monthly installments of Funds. If 
the amount of the Funds held by 
Lender shall not be sufficient to pay the Escrow Items as they fall due, Bor:rower shall pay to Lender any 
amount necessary to make up the deficiency in one or more payments as Lender may require. 
Upon payment in full of all s= 
secured by this Deed of Trust, Lender shall promptly refund to 
Borrower any Funds held by Lender. If 
under paragraph 16 hereof the Property is sold or the Property is 
otherwise acqurred by Lender, Lender shall apply, no later than immediately prior to the sale of the 
Property or its acquisition. by Lender, any Funds held by Lender at the time of application as a credit

the principal of 
the Note. Such payments shall be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in wruch it

fees, the absence of 
express authority in this Deed of

construed as a prohibition of the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge f~es iliat are expressly 
prohibited by 
this Deed of

If 
the Loan is subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that law is fmal.ly inte1preted so

permitted limits, then (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the 
charge to the permitted limit, and (b) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded the 
permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may choose to make this refund by reducing ilie 
principal owed under the No 
to or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, 
the reduction will be treated as a par-tial prepayment wiiliout any prepayment charge (whether or not a 
prepayment charge is provided for under ilie Note}. Borrower-'s acceptance of any such refund made by 
direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of 
any right of action Borrower might have arising out 
of 
such overcharge.

this Deed of Trust and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations nnder the Note, this Deed of 
Trost, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan S~-rvicer unrelated to a

the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the 
change that will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments 
should be made and any other information required by Applicable Law in connection wiili a notice of 
transfer of servicing. If 
the Note is sold and thereafter the Loan is serviced by a Loan Servicer other than

Servicer or be transferred to a successor Loan Servicer and are not assumed by the Note purchaser unless 
otherwise provided by tho Note purchaser. 
Neiilier Borrower nor Lender may co=ence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (as either an 
individual litigant or ilie member of a class) that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Deed 
of Trust or that alleges that ilie other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, 
this Deed of 
Trust, until such Borrower or Lender has notified ilie oilier party, in accordance with Section 
12, of such alleged breach and afforded the other party hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such 
notice to take corrective action. If 
Applicable Law provides a time period which must elapse before certain 
actio11 can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of 
this paragraph. The 
notice of acceleration and opportunity to cure given to Borrower pmsnant to Section 18 and ilie notice of 
acceler-ation given to Borrower pu=ant to Section 15 shall be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity

secured hereby. Lender may eiect to allow the Borrower to reinstate the Joan providing that; (a) Borrower

Dear Ms. O'Keeffe: 
Per our recent discussions regarding the upcoming DOT project to widen 1-45 in La 
Marque, Texas, in order for the DOT to complete the proposed feeder road overpasses, your 
billboard signs identified in Texas City Terminal Railway's records as T-0593(1) and T-
0593(2) will need to be relocated. 
I understand that in order to secure permits to relocate the sigs within the Texas City 
Terminal Railway's mainline railway corridor, you require the railroad's consent. 
This letter shall serve as your consent to the proposed relocation of your signs as shown 
in the attached drawing. 
If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact me at (281) 687-4156.

Subject: RE: City of La Marque Response: ROWCSJ: 0500-04-139; Parcel: 533 OAS. Part 1 and Part 2 
Importance: High 
Please see the City's response below: 
Mr. Herrera, 
The City is willing to entertain applications to the Board of Adjustments to allow relocation or reconstruction of 
existing billboards as continuation of a legal nonconforming use. The Board of Adjustments may place additional 
requirements on a sign before they give approval and such approval is completely within the discretion of the Board 
on a case by case basis. Sign owners that wish to pursue this option can submit the request using the city's variance 
application form. In addition to this form, the owner must submit the following additional information specific to this 
type of request: 
1) 
Explanation of whether the existing sign will be relocated or a new sign will be constructed (existing signs 
may only be relocated if they are in good repair and capable of meeting area wind loads); 
2) 
Details on the size of the sign face, height of the sign, and construction materials (the new sign Cannot be 
larger or taller than it was previously); 
A vicinity map and detailed location plan showing the setbacks from easements, rights-of-way, streets, property lines, 
and other structures; 
Landowner permission if the sign owner does not own the land; and 
Approval of proposed location and structural sign design be any other billboard owners on immediately adjacent 
property (i.e. the new sign cannot block any other nearby sign faces). 
I note that the new signs will be required to meet the setback requirements of the applicable zoning district and that a 
City building permit will still be required following BOA approval and receipt of a TxDOT permit. This option is only 
available to those signs impacted by the 1-45 project that are on the list you provided. 
Alternatively, a sign owner may request a digital billboard conversion agreement with the City. as previously 
discussed. 
If 
we are contacted directly by any sign owners, we will provide this same information, but you are welcome to 
provide it to them also. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance in this matter.

Approval Date:     
Submitted By:      Sussie Sutton 
 
SUBJECT:  Consideration and possible action regarding a request by the owners of PID# 
132855 located on FM 1765 for a variance to the City’s zoning regulations, specifically 
Sections 71-27 Thoroughfare Overlay District ordinance (e)(8) regulating the front, side, 
and rear building set back lines for any new construction. 3101 FM 1765 
 
 
DISCUSSION:  Mr. Nazim Momin, owner of this Light Industrial zoned property located 
on FM 1764 La Marque, presented the staff with an application to the Board of 
Adjustments to construct a washateria at this location. The size of the property 
constricts the placement of the building for this proposed project. Mr. Momin feels that 
if he could place the building as close as possible to the property line he would be able 
to move forward with the project. Without the approval of this variance the project 
will not be able to move forward.  
 
 
RECOMMENDATION:  Staff has no objection to this variance, Sections 71-27 
Thoroughfare Overlay District ordinance (e)(8) regulating the front, side, and rear 
building set back lines for any new construction.
