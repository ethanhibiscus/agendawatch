FUTURE AGENDA DISCUSSION 
 
ADJOURNMENT 
        UPPER PROVIDENCE TOWNSHIP 
 PLANNING COMMISSION  
REGULAR MEETING 
Wednesday, May 13, 2020 
 
 
A meeting of the Upper Providence Township Planning Commission was 
held via Zoom webinar on Wednesday May 13, 2020. Attending were Planning Commission 
members Chris Caggiano, Bob Heist, Tom Wright, Robert Gilinger and Matt Caffrey. Also in 
attendance were Bill Dingman from the Township Engineer’s Office, Joseph Bresnan, Esq. 
Township Solicitor, Anthony Valencia from the Township Traffic Engineer’s Office, and 
Geoffrey Grace, Township Director of Planning. 
 
 
Call to Order 
 
The regular meeting was called to order by Mr. Caggiano at 7:05 p.m. 
 
 
Public Comment for Non-Agenda Items 
 
 
None.  
 
 
Minutes to be approved 
 
The following minutes were reviewed: 
March 11, 2020 
 
Mr. Wright motioned, seconded by Mr. Heist, to approve the Planning Commission 
minutes from March 11, 2020. Motion carried 5-0. 
 
 
2019 Clean Up Ordinance Draft & Discussion 
 
Mr. Grace discussed the latest version of the clean-up ordinance. The most recent 
added item changed the plan submission requirements to a lesser amount of copies. Mr. 
Grace explained the history of the process which included having the consultants review 
the ordinance and make recommendations. Solicitor Bresnan added that most of the 
changes involve waiver issues that the Planning Commission was routinely granting, i.e. 
slope on the bottom of the retention basin. Mr. Dingman stated that these changes will 
bring the ordinance into compliance with current engineering standards. Mr. Heist liked 
the direction and hopes that there will be less waiver requests. Mr. Caggiano asked if there 
were any waivers granted that should be looked at again. Solicitor Bresnan used sidewalks 
and curbs as an example of waivers. He further stated that courts have held that waivers 
that foster good development must be granted. Mr. Dingman and Solicitor Bresnan 
discussed parking waivers for two locations. Mr. Grace discussed the next steps for the 
ordinance including dates for a possible hearing. Mr. Caggiano stated that this matter 
should be tabled for another month due to the lack of public input and public hearings due 
to the pandemic. Mr. Wright agreed but also wants this to move forward so it is not the

agenda with changes every month. Mr. Gilinger asked if this ordinance runs parallel with 
the comprehensive plan. Mr. Grace stated the township traffic engineer is working on the 
Complete Streets manual part. He further stated that the changes to the clean-up ordinance 
are more technical/engineering based. Mr. Grace will send to the draft to the Board of 
Supervisors to give them an opportunity to review the changes and a public hearing will be 
requested at a later time. 
 
Subdivision and Land Development Applications 
1. 209 Fourth Avenue Subdivision 
Present:   
Manrico Troncelliti, Attorney for the Applicant 
 
 
Michael Marchese, Applicant 
 
 
Joseph Venezia, Applicant 
 
 
Joseph Estock, Engineer 
 
 
 
Manrico Troncelliti, Esquire, representing the Applicant, stated that the applicant is 
looking to subdivide a parcel into a three-lot subdivision and construct two new twin 
homes. The property is in the village preservation zoning district. Applicant is looking for 
preliminary and final approval of its plans. The plans have been reviewed several times by 
township consultants and their comments and have been included. 
 
Applicant is requesting five waivers.  
• Waiver to not require existing features within 100 feet of the site. An aerial 
photograph was included with the plan 
• Waiver to request preliminary and final approval. Documents for both 
preliminary and final approval have been submitted 
• Waiver to not require sidewalks along Fourth Avenue. This is consistent with 
the area as there are no existing sidewalks on Fourth Avenue. 
• Waiver to minimum right of way and pavement width of Fourth Avenue. The 
surrounding roads are considered existing village roads. 
• Waiver to not increase the driver width from 10 to 12 feet when curbing is 
being used. 
 
Mr. Caggiano stated that there are a number of consultant letters in the submittal. 
He would like clarification that any additional items on the letters, not listed as waivers, are 
deemed will comply. Mr. Estock stated that the project will comply with the consultants’ 
letters. He also stated that the plans have been revised based on the consultants’ letters and 
a letter was sent to the township outlining the changes. Mr. Grace stated that he received 
the letter and forwarded it to the consultants for their review. To move the project forward, 
he suggested that the applicant have clean letters by the June Board of Supervisors’ 
meeting. Mr. Heist would like to have clean letters before sending this to the Board of 
Supervisors. He stated that the project is on a very difficult site and should have a detailed 
review. Mr. Heist would like to have a more detailed look at the water running through the 
site in conjunction with the waiver request to not include existing features within 100 feet.

He feels that the plan will work but it is a very difficult site. The site plan and aerial map 
were reviewed. Attorney Troncelliti stated that the water course was mostly dry and the 
plan meets the township’s stormwater requirements. Attorney Bresnan asked if there was 
anything specific Mr. Heist was referring to that was not discussed in the consultant review 
letters. He further stated that any difficulties with the site would be the responsibility of the 
developer. Mr. Grace stated that the plan was before the Planning Commission for tentative 
approval and before the Zoning Hearing Board where it received steep slope relief. 
Attorney Bresnan further commented that the prior twin subdivision was before the 
Planning Commission not that long ago. Mr. Heist commented that the two plans are 
substantial different due to the location of the site plan. Mr. Dingman stated that the 
proposed site plan has 1-foot contours for a total of 4-5 feet above the 100-year flood plain 
elevation. He stated that the structures would not impact the 100-year flood plain. The 
impact would be on the steep slopes, which the applicant already received relief from the 
Zoning Hearing Board. 
 
Mr. Heist asked for clarification on the trees shown in the aerial photo, specifically if 
they were to all be removed or some saved. Mr. Dingman stated that the trees near the 
flood plain would be saved but the trees at the top of the site would be removed. 
 
The architectural rendering was reviewed. Mr. Caffrey asked if the basement would 
be taking up grade and there is a small amount. The rendering shows a slab on grade. 
 
Mr. Valencia stated that the McMahon letter did not have many comments. He stated 
that there were no remaining concerns from a traffic perspective. 
 
Mr. Heist made a motion that 209 Fourth Avenue Subdivision, Plan #03027 -0354-
0003 P(SD) be recommended for preliminary approval with the stipulation that all 
comments in the consultants’ letters are agreed to, and with the waivers as listed in the 
May 7, 2020 letter. The plan is recommended to move forward to the Board of Supervisors 
for final approval. The motion was seconded by Mr. Wright. Mr. Caggiano asked for public 
comment, none was offered. The motion was passed 5-0. 
 
Applications Pending Review 
 
Mr. Grace discussed applications pending review. He stated that Items 2, 3, 5 and 6 
are not good candidates for this type of virtual meeting. There is currently no time clock 
issues. Mr. Grace advised that the Yerkes and Hopwood plans are in the process of 
obtaining clean consultant letters. Solicitor Bresnan stated that he spoke with Attorney 
Zarro and was advised that Mr. Silver recognizes a virtual meeting would be difficult to 
allow for public comment and questions regarding the Yerkes and Hopwood plans. Solicitor 
Bresnan also stated that the deed restrictions are in place for these plans. Mr. Grace stated 
that his last discussions with the neighbors included not having a meeting in April – said 
meeting was cancelled due to the pandemic anyway. He feels that the neighbors will be

attending the next public meeting.  
 
Mr. Caggiano asked about the property address for the Greenwood subdivision. Mr. 
Grace stated that this project is being completed by WB Homes. Mr. Grace stated that there 
is a township ordinance allowing the transfer of property from one developer to another. 
AT this time there has only been informal discussion about the transfer. Mr. Caggiano asked 
if the plans would be open again due to the transfer. Mr. Grace stated the property has 14 
units approved. The proposal is to sell the development rights of 13 of the units to the 357 
Greenwood Avenue Subdivision developer, leaving one unit on the Barker tract. The 
Greenwood Avenue Subdivision would go from 26 to 39 units. Items still included with the 
WB Homes plan are the sidewalk along Hess Road, the connection to the Township 
property at Hess and Valley View Roads, and the connection through the property to 
continue the trail system. This has only been discussed informally with no formal plan 
submitted to date. 
 
Mr. Grace stated that an item on the agenda for the May 27, 2020 meeting would be 
357 Greenwood Avenue Subdivision. He was advised earlier today that the application 
would not be ready for that meeting and requested to be moved to a later meeting. Also, 
Pope John Paul requested that the plan be moved to a meeting later in the summer. Mr. 
Grace stated that the May 27, 2020 Planning Commission meeting should be cancelled. The 
next meeting would be June __, 2020 
 
Adjournment 
 
Mr. Wright motioned, seconded by Mr. Caffrey, to adjourn at 7:57 p.m. Motion 
carried 5-0.

Dear Geoff: 
 
As requested, on behalf of Upper Providence Township, McMahon Associates, Inc. has completed a 
sixth traffic engineering review of the proposed development located on the western side of Hollow 
Road south of Schell Lane in Upper Providence Township. It is our understanding that the proposed 
development will consist of a 30,000 square foot building consisting of 9,500 square feet of office space 
and 20,500 square feet of warehouse space. Access will be provided via a full-movement driveway to 
Hollow Road, as well as an emergency-only access proposed to/from Egypt Road directly opposite 
MacDade Road. 
 
The following documents were reviewed in preparation of our review: 
 
▪ 
Final Land Development Plans for Providence Business Park 3, LLC/HBFC, prepared by 
Ludgate Engineering Corporation, last revised May 1, 2020. 
▪ 
Response to Comments Memo for HBFC Land Development Plan, prepared by Ludgate 
Engineering Corporation, dated May 4, 2020. 
 
Based on our review of the submitted documents noted above, McMahon has no further traffic related 
comments pertaining to the land development plans that need to be addressed at this time and finds 
the plans satisfactory for action by the Board of Supervisors. Please note, as a reminder to the 
applicant, that the approved Highway Occupancy Permit (HOP) Plans prepared by Traffic Planning 
and Design, Inc. associated with the emergency access, must be resubmitted to PennDOT for a 
supplemental permit to reflect the 60 ft. access easement at the intersection with Hollow Road and 
ensure consistency between the Land Development Plans and the PennDOT HOP plans.

RE: 
Traffic Engineering Review No. 5 
Ridgewood Phase 2B Review 
 
Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, PA 
 
McMahon Project No. 816298.11 
 
Township Escrow No. 304 
 
Dear Geoff: 
 
 
As requested, on behalf of Upper Providence Township, McMahon Associates, Inc. has completed a 
traffic engineering review of the modifications to the land development plans for the proposed 
residential development to be located along the southern side of Linfield Road (S.R. 4017) opposite 
Pennapacker Road and Fieldcrest Drive in Upper Providence Township. It is our understanding that the 
proposed development will occur in phases with Phase 1, which has been approved and is currently 
under construction, consisting of 51 townhouse units.  Phase 2A will consist of 68 townhouse units, Phase 
2B will consist of 58 townhouse units, and Phase 2C will consist of 58 townhouse units and one single 
family home. Access to Phases 1 and 2 of the development is proposed via the two (2) existing full 
movement intersections with Linfield Road (S.R. 4017), one opposite Pennapacker Road and the other 
opposite Fieldcrest Drive. It should be noted that this letter only pertains to the site modifications for 
Phase 2B of the development, which include increasing the lot width for units 172 to 177 from 20 feet 
to 24 feet. Since lots 172 to 177 will now have two-car garages instead of the previously proposed one-
car garages, the applicant is proposing to remove three (3) visitor spaces along Spring Lane and three 
(3) visitor spaces in the parking area across from units 178-183 in Phase 2C. 
The following document was reviewed in preparation of our review: 
 
▪ 
Final Subdivision & Land Development Plans for Ridgewood – Phase 2B, prepared by Bursich 
Associates, last revised March 6, 2020. 
 
Based on our review of the submitted documents noted above, McMahon has no other traffic comments 
related to the submitted plans that need to be addressed at this time and finds the plans satisfactory for 
action by the Board of Supervisors.

Pope John Paul II High School Stadium 
Amended Final Plan Review 
Twp. Plan #5006-0358-0002 LD 
 
Dear Geoff: 
 
In accordance with the Township’s request, we have reviewed the amended final plan for Pope John 
Paul II Stadium.  The review consisted of a four (4) sheets, titled “Amended Final Plan “Pope John Paul 
II Stadium,”” dated January 23, 2020, prepared by McCarthy Engineering, and associated Erosion and 
Sediment Pollution Control Report and Hydraulic Report.  This plan is being reviewed as an amended 
final plan submission.  The subject property is located on Rittenhouse Road at the south east corner of 
township Line Road.  The site is currently a high school with an athletic field without lights.  The proposal 
is to add a new concrete deck, building, and bleachers at the existing athletic field.  We offer the following 
comments for your consideration: 
 
Subdivision and Land Development 
 
1. 
§154-26.A. – There appear to be slopes greater than 3H:1V between the proposed pathway and 
north of the proposed building.  Please revise these slopes. 
 
General Comments 
 
1. 
It appears the van accessible signage is shown on the incorrect ADA parking spaces on Sheet 2.  
Please revise to place the van accessible signs at the parking spaces near the eight-foot-wide 
striping area. 
 
2. 
On Sheet 3, there is a 245-contour label along the proposed paving walkway which should be 
240-contour label. 
 
3. 
The grade of the existing paved access walkway from the eastern parking lot to the area at the 
back of the concession stand is approximately 15%.  The grade of the proposed paved access 
walkway to replace the existing walkway is approximately 19%. 
 
4. 
There is a large grade change in grade between the 19% slope proposed paving walkway to were 
it meets the lower level walkway at a slope of 2%.  This slope transition shall be made more 
gradual.

5. 
The proposed lower level retaining wall as shown has wall heights over four feet.  Structural 
calculations and details for the elevated walkway and retaining walls will be required prior to 
construction. 
 
6. 
The dimensions and elevations provided in the Concrete Trench Drain Detail on Sheet 4 shall 
match that of the trench drain in plan view.

The following should be noted concerning the submission of plan to amend the final plan of the Pope 
John Paul II High School campus. The current lot, parcel number 61-00-04459-007, is located at 181 
Rittenhouse Road (at the intersection of Rittenhouse and Township Line Roads): 
1. The applicant is proposing home bleachers, a ticket booth, and concession stand, all to be served by 
water and sewer. 
 
2. The subject parcel is within the Township’s Institutional Overlay Zone with the R-1, Residential 
Agricultural District as the underlying district. 
 
3. This is the first review of this proposed change to the High School Campus. The site recently received 
approval for the installation of lighting by the Board of Supervisors on February 18, 2020. 
 
4. The submitted plans consist of a four (4) sheet set, drawn by McCarthy Engineering. 
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance Compliance Review 
5. The submitted plans do not comply with the requirements for a final plan. The details and 
requirements of §154-13.A.(2) and §154-13.B.(2) are not shown on the plans.  While it is 
acknowledged that this change to the overall campus will likely not impact any of the data required 
by those sections, the applicant should, at a minimum, include an overall site plan showing how this 
change fits in the context of the overall site.

RE: 
Traffic Engineering Review #1 – Amended Final Plan 
 
Pope John Paul II Stadium Modifications 
 
Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, PA 
 
McMahon Project No. 820219.11 
 
Township Escrow No. 358 
 
Dear Geoff: 
 
As requested, on behalf of Upper Providence Township, McMahon Associates, Inc. has completed our 
initial traffic engineering review of the site modifications for the addition of bleachers to be added to the 
Pope John Paul II High School stadium in Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, PA.  It is 
our understanding from the plans received that the proposed site modifications will consist of installing 
bleachers, an approximate 13,000 square-foot concrete pad to be used for entry to the stadium, and 
accessory buildings, while modifying existing walkway(s) to/from the existing field.  Access to the overall 
site will continue to be provided via the existing site driveways along Rittenhouse Road and Township 
Line Road. 
 
The following document was reviewed in preparation of our review: 
 
 
Amended Final Land Development Plans for Pope John Paul II Stadium, prepared by McCarthy 
Engineering Associates, Inc., dated January 23, 2020. 
 
Based on our review of the submitted document noted above, McMahon offers the following comments 
for consideration by the Township and action by the applicant:   
 
1. The applicant should provide information on who will access the stadium via the walkway on 
the eastern side of the stadium. Since the main entrance gate to the stadium appears to be 
proposed on the southeastern side of the stadium, it appears as though this walkway will be 
Mr. Geoffrey Grace 
March 9, 2020 
Page 2 of 3 
used by staff/personnel during large events; however, the applicant must confirm this and 
describe whether it is also anticipated that the walkway will be available to access by the public. 
 
2. The applicant should provide details on the expected traffic and pedestrian operations in the 
immediate vicinity of the stadium during large events. Of specific concern is the potential for a 
high frequency of pedestrians walking to the stadium from the parking area located to the east 
of the stadium and crossing the two-way drive aisle between this parking area and the stadium. 
If necessary, during large events, consideration should be given to providing a crossing guard 
or some other safety measures at this location. Additionally, a high visibility crosswalk, 
appropriate signage, and compliant ADA facilities design in compliance with all federal and 
State requirements should also be considered in order to enhance pedestrian safety in this area, 
particularly due to the anticipated stadium events. 
 
3. A pedestrian connection should be considered and provided from the parking area to the 
southeast of the stadium and the sidewalk located immediately to the north of the ADA parking 
spaces located to the south of the stadium. This pedestrian connection must then include the 
appropriate ADA facilities, including a high visibility crosswalk across the drive aisle east of the 
stadium, signage, and the necessary sidewalk sections. All ADA facilities must de designed to 
current Federal and State requirements. 
 
4. The Township Fire Marshal should review the plans in order to confirm that visitors to the 
stadium are able to safely exit the stadium during large events if an emergency situation arises 
during such events. Ensure that any correspondence, including any review comments and/or 
approvals, is included in subsequent submissions. 
 
5. The proposed site modifications are not expected to generate additional traffic during the 
weekday afternoon peak hour; therefore, the application should not be subject to a 
transportation impact fee. 
 
6. Future submissions by the High School for campus enhancements should include more of a 
Master Plan of the vision for the campus, so that proper planning can be done for the multi-
modal transportation elements that should be considered and addressed.   When done in piece-
meal phases, occasionally recommendations for a single phase may not be the best overall plan 
and have to be revised later. 
 
7. Based on our review, the applicant should address the aforementioned comments, and provide 
revised plans to the Township and our office for further review and approval recommendations. 
The applicant's engineer must provide a response letter that describes how each specific 
review comment has been addressed, where each can be found in the plan set or materials, as 
opposed to general responses. This will aid in the detailed review and subsequent review 
timeframes.

and all documents and information delivered to Buyer by Seller or Seller’s representatives, are 
delivered to Buyer as an accommodation and Seller: (1) has not made any independent 
investigation or verification of such information; and (2) makes no representations or warranties 
as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. Buyer acknowledges having been given 
the opportunity to inspect the Premises pursuant to this Agreement, and except for the express 
representations and warranties of the Seller in this Agreement and the deed (when and after

information provided or to be provided by Seller. 
4. 
DUE DILIGENCE.  
a. 
Due Diligence Period. For a period of forty-five (45) days following the 
Effective Date (the “Due Diligence Period”), Buyer shall have the ability, at Buyer’s sole cost 
and expense, to conduct and make any and all non-invasive studies, examinations, surveys, 
inspections and investigations of, or concerning, the Premises, including, without limitation, (i) a 
Phase I environmental site assessment and soils testing, (ii) a wetlands and floodplain delineation 
and analysis, geotechnical studies, a storm water management evaluation, (iii) an inspection as to 
the ability to develop and operate commercial uses to be determined by Buyer on the Premises, 
(iv) an inspection as to the ability to use the existing building in compliance with the current 
3 
F:\CF\MALVERN SCHOOL\EGYPT RD- PHOENIXVILLE, PA\Puchase Agreement (8).doc 
zoning, subdivision, land development and other applicable ordinances, (v) an inspection as to 
the condition of the title to the Premises, including any restrictions, encumbrances and/or 
easements applicable thereto, as well as the Declaration, (vii) an inspection of the improvements 
located on the Premises (if any), (viii) an investigation into the ability of Buyer to obtain 
financing for the development of the Premises on terms and conditions acceptable to Buyer, and 
(ix) any other reviews, inspections or interviews Buyer deems necessary in connection with 
Buyer’s proposed use of the Premises (all of the foregoing tests, studies, examinations, 
inspections and investigations are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Tests”).  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer hereby acknowledges that no invasive environmental tests 
(except for soils boring tests) or any “Phase II” environmental audits may be performed by 
Buyer unless Seller has provided its prior written consent thereto, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such request by Buyer for any invasive 
environmental testing (except for soils boring tests) is accompanied by a “Phase I” inspection 
report (including all test results and analysis thereof) prepared by a reputable environmental 
engineering company which recommends such additional testing and sets forth the basis thereof 
in reasonable detail.  Any physical audits of the Premises shall be performed by a contractor 
chosen and hired by Buyer and shall be paid for solely by Buyer; provided, however, that any 
such contractor must possess all necessary licenses and permits to perform the audits.  Except as 
otherwise expressly set forth herein or as required by applicable law, Buyer shall not, without the 
prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in Seller’s sole discretion, release 
the results of any such audits to any other person or entity.  Buyer shall provide Seller the 
opportunity, at Seller's expense, to attend any discussions or meetings concerning the Premises 
with Buyer and any governmental or quasi-governmental agency.    Prior to any entry by Buyer 
or its representatives upon the Premises, Buyer shall give Seller twenty-four (24) hours’ notice of 
the date and time of the entry and of the specific inspections to be undertaken.  This notice may 
be sent via email to Seller at jascandone@malvernschool.com with a copy to 
Stephen.Marzullo@cbre.com.  Seller shall have the right to accompany Buyer and each of its 
representatives during any entry on the Premises.   
b. 
Termination. If Buyer determines, in Buyer’s sole discretion, not to 
acquire the Premises, for any reason and no reason at all, then Buyer may, at its option, terminate 
this Agreement by delivery of written notice to Seller on or before the expiration of the Due 
Diligence Period (a “Due Diligence Termination Notice”).  Upon timely delivery of the Due 
Diligence Termination Notice, the Escrow Agent shall promptly return the Deposit to Buyer, and 
thereafter, this Agreement shall terminate and neither party shall have any further rights, duties, 
liabilities or obligations, at law or in equity, arising out of or relating to this Agreement except 
those that expressly survive termination of this Agreement. If for any reason Closing does not 
occur, Buyer agrees to, following the termination of this Agreement, turn over to Seller all Test 
results and studies performed by Buyer during the term of this Agreement at no charge. If Buyer 
fails to timely deliver a Due Diligence Termination Notice, Buyer’s Due Diligence Period and 
contingency is deemed waived.  
c. 
Conduct of Tests. In connection with the Tests, Buyer shall act in 
commercially reasonable and customary manner. Buyer shall promptly repair and restore the 
Premise, at Buyer’s sole cost and expense, to the condition existing prior to such testing and

a. 
Due Diligence Access. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 above, 
Seller shall allow Buyer and Buyer’s agents, contractors, engineers, consultants and employees 
to enter onto the Premises from time to time prior to the earlier of the (i) expiration of the Due 
Diligence Period, (ii) waiver of the Due Diligence Period, or (iii) the termination of this 
Agreement, to conduct the Tests. 
b. 
Permits and Approvals.  
i. 
Application. Within one hundred fifty (150) days of the Effective

diligently pursue the issuance of, all governmental and quasi-governmental permits and 
approvals (the “Permits and Approvals”) to: (i) subdivide the Premises and improve the units for 
the desired use of Buyer, and (ii) obtain a conditional use approval for the use of a dance studio 
(the “Site Development Project”) on terms and conditions satisfactory to Buyer and Seller.  
Buyer and Seller each acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall be obligated to provide, at 
Seller’s sole cost and expense, three (3) EDU’s for the Site Development Project. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for the cost of any EDU’s for 
the Site Development Project after Seller provides the first three (3) EDU’s for the Site 
Development Project (i.e. if 4 EDU’s are required, Seller would, at its sole cost and expense, 
provide the first 3 EDU’s, and thereafter, Buyer, at its sole cost and expense would purchase the 
5 
F:\CF\MALVERN SCHOOL\EGYPT RD- PHOENIXVILLE, PA\Puchase Agreement (8).doc 
final 1 EDU). If Buyer shall fail to make application for preliminary approval by the Application 
Deadline, Buyer shall be in default of this Agreement, and, Seller may, upon written notice to 
Buyer terminate this Agreement, whereupon Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit, along with 
any accrued interest thereon, to Seller and this Agreement shall terminate and neither party shall

Approvals on terms and conditions satisfactory to Buyer on or before the Application Deadline 
(the “Approval Period”), Buyer or Seller may terminate this Agreement by delivery of written 
notice to the other party any time after the expiration of the Approval Period and prior to the 
issuance of the Permits and Approvals on terms and conditions satisfactory to Buyer (an 
“Approval Termination Notice”).    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that after the 
Effective Date, the Governor of Pennsylvania issues an order directing all non-essential 
businesses to cease operations during the Approval Period, and, as a result thereof, Buyer is 
unable to continue its pursuit of the Approvals, the Approval Period shall be automatically 
extended one (1) day for each day the order is in effect and Buyer is unable to continue its 
pursuit of the Approvals. 
c. 
Paving Access Drive. Seller shall cause to be paved the access drive 
connecting the Premises and Unit 1 of the Condominium (the “Access Drive”)  as depicted on 
the Site Plan attached hereto as Exhibit “C”.  The paving of the Access Drive shall be deemed to 
be completed upon completion of base paving. The Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, pay 
all costs associated with the paving of the Access Drive; provided, however, Buyer shall 
reimburse Seller eighty percent (80%) of the costs associated with the paving of the Access 
Drive in twenty-four (24)  equal monthly installments on the first (1st) day of each month 
commencing on the first (1st) day of the month following the month in which the base paving is 
completed.   Seller shall deliver to Buyer supporting documentation that evidences the total cost 
of the paving of the Access Drive.  Buyer’s obligation to reimburse Seller as aforesaid shall 
survive Closing.   
7.

is unreasonable in amount or that its retention by Seller is a penalty and not agreed upon and 
reasonable liquidated damages. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any indemnity 
obligation of Buyer under this Agreement. Formal tender of the purchase price and deed are 
hereby waived. 
15.

Buyer any Bulk Sale Clearance Certificate or Seller’s failure to pay any amounts due to the 
Commonwealth or otherwise fulfill any of Seller’s tax obligations or liability to the 
Commonwealth, Seller shall promptly post a bond and do whatever else is reasonably required to

of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to Closing that is expressly stated to 
survive Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller thereof, and such representation, warranty, 
covenant or agreement shall not survive Closing (whether or not Buyer notifies Seller thereof) 
but, rather, shall merge into the Deed to be given by Seller, it being the intention of the parties 
that no breach or non performance of which Buyer has knowledge prior to Closing shall survive

Re:
357 Greenwood Road
           Conditional Use and Tentative Sketch Application
Dear Mr. Tieperman, 
Blecker Acquisitions, LP is the equitable owner of two parcel of ground along Greenwood 
Avenue consisting of TMP 61-00-02236-00-7 and 61-00-02237-00-6 totaling 33.65 acres 
(“Property”). We intend to develop the Property as 25 new single family building lots and a 
lot for the existing historic home at 357 Greewood Avenueusing the flexible lot size 
provisions of the R-1 Zoning District. Since the tract of land is under 35 acres, the use of the 
flexible lot size provisions requires a conditional use approval by the Board of Supervisors. 
The Conditional Use review is based on whether the applicant has met one or more of the 
criteria detailed under section 182-44 B. of the R-1 zoning provisions.   The Property has a 
number of natural features on the property including a water course, wetlands and flood 
plains that will be far better protected and preserved through the use of the flexible lots 
size provisions than under the traditional zoning provisions. In addition, 26.36% of the tract 
of ground will be preserved as open space.  Finally, the house at 357 Greenwood Avenue 
dates back to the late 1600’s to early 1700’s and will be retained as part of this 
application.
As support for our application, I have included the following:
1. Three copies of the Conditional Use and Tentative Sketch Plan Application
2. Ten copies of a Yield Plan for the property
3. Ten copies of a the Tentative Sketch Plan for the property
4. Check in the amount of $500 for the Conditional Use Application
5. Check in the amount of $1,200 for the Tentative Sketch Application
6. Check in the amount of $15,000 for the professional services escrow

Twp. #8002-0360-001 CU – Conditional Use Review 
Twp. #8002-0360-002 (T) LD – Tentative Plan Review 
 
Dear Geoff: 
 
In accordance with the Township’s request, we have reviewed the Conditional Use and Tentative Plan for the 357 
Greenwood Avenue Subdivision.  The review consisted of a two (2) standalone sheets, a Flexible Lot Sketch dated 
January 14, 2020, last revised February 10, 2020, and a Yield Sketch, dated November 25, 2019, last revised 
February 10, 2020, both prepared by Bohler Engineering.  We offer the following comments for your consideration: 
 
General Description 
 
1. 
The subject tract is made up of two properties; Parcel No. 61-00-02236-00-7 and Parcel No. 61-00-02237-
00-6, located along the west side of Greenwood Avenue (State Route 4011) approximately 3,300 feet north 
of Greenwood Ave and West Main Street intersection.  The tract is within the R-1 Residential-Agricultural 
Zoning District.  The total tract area is 34.829 acres gross (34.423 acres net) with the applicant proposing 
to develop the site with 25 new single-family dwellings and 1 existing dwelling for a total of 26 dwellings.  
The development is proposed to be served by public water and public sewer. 
 
2. 
The applicant is requesting a Conditional Use to develop the tract with the Flexible Lot Size provision in the 
R-1 District (Chapter 182-44.B.). 
 
3. 
The property has approximately 1,062 feet of frontage on Greenwood Avenue classified as a Feeder road 
(60’ ultimate right-of-way).  The plans show an existing 33 feet wide Legal Right-of Way and a widening of 
the Right-of-Way on the site frontage of Greenwood Avenue to the required Township Ultimate Right-of-
Way.  The plans at this time show no cartway widening of Greenwood Avenue for the tract frontage. 
 
4. 
The applicant is proposing access to the proposed development from Greenwood Avenue with a new cul-
de-sac residential street with an internal road loop connected to the cul-de-sac residential street.  All of the 
proposed residential lots will be accessed from internal roads except the existing dwelling.

SUBJECT: Conditional Use and Tentative Plan Review 
 
 
FROM:

Grace Planning Associates 
 
Zoning Officer / Director of Planning,  
 
 
 
Township of Upper Providence 
 
DATE: 
April 9, 2020 
 
 
The following should be noted concerning the submission of a plan proposing the use of the Flex Lot 
option within the R-1 Zoning District to create fourteen lots for single family detached homes. Parcel 
numbers 61-00-02236-00-7 and 61-00-02237-00-6, is located on Greenwood Avenue, north of the 
intersection of Greenwood and Main Street: 
1. The subject parcel is currently within the R-1, Residential Agricultural District. 
 
2. This proposed use of the flex lot option on a parcel less than 35 acres requires a conditional use, per 
the requirements outlined within § 182-44.B; the parcels combine to a total of 34.423 acres net 
developable area. 
 
3. This review is based on a “Yield Sketch” (dated November 25, 2019 and last revised February 10, 
2020) and a “Tentative Sketch Plan” (Dated January 14, 2020 and last revised February 10, 2020), 
both drawn by Bohler Engineering.   
 
Conditional Use Plan 
4. Per § 182-44.B the flex lot option may be used by a developer with a tract with less than 35 acres if 
that developer obtains a conditional use approval from the Board of Supervisors. As well as meeting 
the procedures outlined within § 182-204 (see comment #5), the applicant must show that one or 
more of the following ordinance criteria are met: 
a. That a significant portion of the tract contains natural features (as in, but not limited to, 
floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, etc.) which would be lost under traditional lot 
development [ref.: § 182-44.B.(1)]. 
 
b. Open space preserved through the flex lot option would preserve one of the properties 
identified in the Township’s Open Space Plan [ref.: § 182-44.B.(2)]. Please note that this 
parcel has not been shown on any Township Open Space or the 2010 Comprehensive Plan 
Update, or the Township’s currently adopted Official Map as a parcel for preservation. 
 
c. The homestead on the parcel is considered a historic farmstead and would be preserved and 
reused through the use of the flex lot option [ref.: § 182-44.B.(3)]. Please note, plans 
submitted show the existing home being retained.

d. The use of the flex lot option would better achieve the Township’s goal for maintaining rural 
character than development under the base R-1 guidelines [ref.: § 182-44.B.(4)]. 
 
5. Conditional Use requirements are outlined within § 182-204 and require that during a public hearing 
the applicant prove that the proposed conditional use: 
a. will not adversely affect the public interest; 
 
b. the proposed development complies with the intent of the Zoning; and  
 
c. the health, safety, and welfare are being protected. 
 
6. Section 182-44.G requires the submission of a plan to establish the number of developable lots under 
the base R-1 Zoning. The applicant’s submitted by-right plan is drawn to the required standards of a 
tentative sketch plan and accurately shows that under the base R-1 zoning, 26 lots would be the 
maximum number of developable lots. From my standpoint, the applicant has met the requirement 
as outlined within the Zoning Ordinance and for application of the conditional use option. 
 
The applicant should be prepared to give testimony and evidence to the outlined requirements and details 
regarding the yield plan at both the Planning Commission for their recommendation on the Conditional 
Use and the Board of Supervisors at the Conditional Use Hearing. 
Tentative Plan / Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance Compliance Review 
7. Once established by Montgomery County Planning Commission all plan submissions should include 
the MCPC File Number, as required by § 154-11.K and § 154-14.M. 
 
8. As required by § 154-21, sidewalks are to be installed along all new or improved streets. Submitted 
plans do not show internal sidewalks or along the Greenwood Avenue frontage. Plans should be 
revised to include sidewalks at the preliminary plan stage, if such a plan is submitted.  
 
9. As required by § 154-22, curb is to be installed along all new and widened roads. Submitted plans 
are not clear as to the future installation of curb. At the preliminary plan, if such a plan is submitted, 
the future installation of curbing should be clarified or the applicant may ask for a waiver from this 
requirement. 
 
10. Acknowledging that landscaping is not normally shown or reviewed at this early stage of land 
development review, if a preliminary plan is submitted, landscaping details and notes should be 
included.  Any landscape plan should include the notes and details required within § 154-12.G. 
Proposed landscaping shall meet the requirements for street trees within § 154-36.C, buffer planting 
requirements detailed within § 154-36.D, and all proposed plant material shall be taken from the 
recommended plant lists included in the Upper Providence Engineering and Construction Improvement 
Standards and Improvement Procedures.

refined, the applicant will need to identify the extent of the relief necessary and obtain that relief 
from the Township’s Zoning Hearing Board. 
 
12. Section 182-43 requires that any open space area shall be usable open space and will be governed by 
those regulations outlined within Article IVA, Open Space and Recreational Facilities, Chapter 154, 
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO). At the preliminary plan stage, the 
applicant should demonstrate compliance with the requirements outlined in Article IVA of the 
SALDO. 
 
13. Acknowledging that landscaping is not formally reviewed until the preliminary plan stage, the 
application should show a buffer along Greenwood Avenue, as required by § 182-44.J.(2), if such a 
plan is submitted.

RE: 
Traffic Engineering Review #1 – Flexible-Lotting Sketch Plan 
 
Proposed Residential Development (357 Greenwood Avenue) 
 
Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, PA 
 
McMahon Project No. 820168.11 
 
Township Escrow No. 360 
 
Dear Geoff: 
 
As requested, on behalf of Upper Providence Township, McMahon Associates, Inc. has completed a 
traffic engineering review of the proposed residential development to be located at 357 Greenwood 
Avenue in Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, PA.  It is our understanding that the 
proposed development will consist of 25 single-family homes (lots 1 to 25), in addition to the existing 
single-family home on lot 26.  The applicant has produced a Yield Plan to show that they desire to 
develop those same number of R-1 residential lots by conditional use with flexible lot sizes that will 
provide smaller lots with more open space.   Access to lots 1 to 25 will be provided via a proposed 
roadway connection to Greenwood Avenue while access to lot 26 will continue to be provided via the 
existing driveway connection to Greenwood Avenue. 
 
The following documents were reviewed in preparation of our review: 
 
• 
Flexible Lotting Sketch Plan for Blecker Acquisitions, L.P., prepared by Bohler Engineering, last 
revised February 10, 2020. 
• 
Yield Sketch Plan for Blecker Acquisitions, L.P., prepared by Bohler Engineering, last revised 
February 10, 2020. 
 
Based on our review of the submitted documents noted above, McMahon offers the following comments 
for consideration by the Township and action by the applicant: 
 
 
 
Mr. Geoffrey Grace 
March 9, 2020 
Page 2 
1. According to the Township’s Roadway Sufficiency Analysis, the proposed development is located 
in Transportation Service Area Two, which has a corresponding impact fee of $2,766.02 per “new” 
weekday afternoon peak hour trip and the applicant will be required to pay a Transportation 
Impact Fee in accordance with the Township’s Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance.   Based on 
Land Use Code 210 (Single-Family Detached Housing) in the Institute of Transportation Engineers 
publication, Trip Generation, Tenth Edition, the proposed 25 single-family homes will generate 
approximately 27 total “new” trips during the weekday afternoon peak hour, resulting in a 
transportation impact fee of $74,682.54. 
 
2. A transportation impact assessment is recommended to be submitted in conjunction with this 
application.  The applicant, or their traffic engineer, should contact our office to discuss the scope 
of that study.  Minimally, the transportation impact assessment should include an analysis of the 
weekday morning and weekday afternoon commuter peak hours for existing traffic conditions, as 
well as opening year conditions, both without and with the proposed development, at the proposed 
site access roadway intersection with Greenwood Avenue and the following off-site intersections: 
 
 
• 
West Main Street (S.R. 4031) and Greenwood Avenue 
• 
Greenwood Avenue and Wartman Road 
 
Mitigation improvements, as applicable, to address levels-of-service and queuing issues and 
degradation should be provided as recommendations in the traffic study.   
 
3. Sight distance measurements for the proposed roadway connection to Greenwood Avenue and the 
existing driveway to lot 26 must be shown on the plan and be in accordance with Section 154-
19.B(1) of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. 
 
4. A clear sight triangle must be shown on the plan at the intersection of Greenwood Avenue and the 
proposed roadway connection as required in Section 154-18.G(5) of the Subdivision and Land 
Development Ordinance. 
 
5. A note should be added to any formal land development plan submission stating that the area 
between the existing right-of-way and ultimate right-of-way will be offered for future taking and 
dedication to the authority having jurisdiction over the road as required in Section 154-18.E(3) of 
the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. 
 
6. The cartway width along the proposed roads should be clearly labeled on the plan and be in 
accordance with Section 154-18.C(4) of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.  The 
new internal road system must also be of sufficient width to allow parking on both sides of the 
road, and if not wide enough will be restricted with signing to only allow on-street parking on one 
side of the road.   Furthermore, sidewalk along both sides of the internal road network to the 
subdivision must fit within the proposed right-of-way. 
 
Mr. Geoffrey Grace 
March 9, 2020 
Page 3 
7. According to Section 154-18.C(3) of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, 
Greenwood Avenue should have a minimum cartway width of 38 feet. The plan shows an 
approximate 24-foot cartway width along the Greenwood Avenue site frontage, thereby not 
satisfying the ordinance requirement. Greenwood Avenue should be widened along the site 
frontage to provide a half-width width of 19 feet from centerline, or a waiver needs to be requested 
from this ordinance requirement.  We recommend to the Township and applicant, that at a 
minimum, the Greenwood Avenue half-width be widened to match the half-width widening for 
the development located to the south near Knoll Road. 
 
8. According to Section 154-21.A of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, sidewalk 
should be provided along the site frontage of Greenwood Avenue. The plan currently does not 
show sidewalk along the site frontage of Greenwood Avenue, thereby not satisfying the ordinance 
requirement.  Sidewalk should then be shown on the plan along the entire site frontage of 
Greenwood Avenue, or a waiver will need to be requested from the Supervisors on this ordinance 
requirement.  In any event, it is recommended that the grading be revised to accommodate a 
potential 4.5-ft. grass buffer and 5-ft. sidewalk along the frontage in the future if sidewalk is not 
provided during land development. Accordingly, ensure that any site amenities/structures are not 
situated in this area so as to not impede the future sidewalk and buffer possibility. The Township 
Board should then consider a fee, in lieu of sidewalk installation should the waiver be requested 
by the applicant and granted the Township Board. 
 
9. Narrow and variable shoulders currently existing along both sides of Greenwood Avenue. A 
minimum 5 ft. shoulder, which would allow for on-road bicyclists through the corridor, should be 
maintained/provided along the site frontage as the project moves forward with more detailed plans 
(i.e., provide similar width to the widening done along Providence Knoll to the south). 
 
10. Sidewalk should be shown on the plan along the interior roads as required by Section 154-21.A of 
the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. 
 
11. According to Section 154-22.A of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, curbing 
should be provided along the site frontage of Greenwood Avenue. The plan currently does not 
show curbing along the site frontage of Greenwood Avenue, thereby not satisfying the ordinance 
requirement.  Curbing is recommended and preferred to be shown on the plan along the 
Greenwood Avenue site frontage similar to curbing provided along the frontage of Providence 
Knoll, or otherwise it will need to be demonstrated that any post-development flow and roadway 
stormwater runoff can be accommodated/controlled through the use of swales, trenches, cross-
driveway pipes, etc. If curbing is not provided, a waiver needs to be requested from this ordinance 
requirement. We note for the Township Board, that curbing is currently located along the site 
frontage of the adjacent property to the south of the site; however, there is no curbing provided 
along the site frontage of the adjacent property to the north of the site. 
 
Mr. Geoffrey Grace 
March 9, 2020 
Page 4 
12. The curb radii should be labeled on the plan at the intersection of Greenwood Avenue and the 
proposed road and meet requirements in Section 154-18.G(8) of the Subdivision and Land 
Development Ordinance. 
 
13. Truck turning and emergency vehicle turning templates should be provided with future 
submissions demonstrating the ability of trash trucks, the largest anticipated design vehicle (e.g. 
AASHTO WB-50 or WB-62), as well as emergency vehicles (dimensions obtained from the 
Township Fire Marshall), to maneuver into and out of the proposed development and entirely 
through the site. 
 
14. A “Stop” sign and “Stop” bar should be shown on the plan on the proposed roadway approach to 
Greenwood Avenue. 
 
15. The plans indicate that some stormwater improvements appear to be proposed on the south end of 
the property that include improvements to a culvert crossing Greenwood Avenue.    Detailed 
engineering information must be provided at the time of land development submission for review, 
including how temporary construction and other easements or rights-of-way will be secured from 
neighboring properties. 
 
16. A more detailed review of the site will be conducted as the project moves forward through a 
detailed land development process.  Additional comments may be raised at that point, including 
design and stormwater items relative to the road and pedestrian network, etc. 
 
17. Based on our review, the applicant should address the aforementioned comments, and provide 
revised plans to the Township and our office for further review and approval recommendations. 
The applicant's engineer must provide a response letter that describes how each specific review 
comment has been addressed, where each can be found in the plan set or materials, as opposed 
to general responses. This will aid in the detailed review and subsequent review timeframes. 
 
We trust that this review letter responds to your request and satisfactorily addresses the traffic issues 
that are related to the proposed development apparent to us at this time.  If you or the Township have 
any questions, or require clarification, please contact me at 215.283.9444 or Anthony Valencia, Project 
Manager, at 610.594.9995. 
 
Sincerely,

Re:  MCPC # 20-0040-001 
Plan Name: 357 Greenwood Avenue Subdivision 
(2 lots comprised of an approximate net tract area of 34.423 acres) 
Situate: 357 Greenwood Avenue 
Upper Providence Township 
 
Dear Mr. Grace: 
 
We have reviewed the above-referenced subdivision and land development plan with the related conditional 
use request in accordance with Section 502 of Act 247, "The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code," as you 
requested on February 14, 2020. We forward this letter as a report of our review. 
BACKGROUND  
The applicant, Blecker Acquisition, LP, proposes to preserve an existing historic home called the Matthias Custer 
House and to build an additional twenty-five single family homes resulting in a total of 26 single family home 
lots. The two existing lots for the proposed development project have an approximate net tract area of 34.423 
acres and are zoned as R-1 Residential-Agricultural. If the conditional use is granted to allow for flexible lotting, 
approximately 11 acres would be preserved as gross open space and approximately 23 acres would be impacted 
by development. 
The proposed flexible lotting sketch indicates 26 lots for single family homes, including a proposed lot for the 
existing historic home. The plan also includes a new roadway and depicts where proposed stormwater 
management areas would be located. Existing steep slopes, waters, and wetlands are also depicted on the plan. 
Currently, the property contains the historic Matthias Custer House, a two-and-a-half story Federal Style home, 
and a nearby pond in the southeastern corner of the property close to Greenwood Avenue. Two tributaries cut 
through the property from north to south and then run along the southern property boundary eastward and 
beneath Greenwood Avenue. The remainder of the land is a mixture of wooded areas, open fields, wetlands, 
and some steep slopes associated with the tributaries. 
Large agricultural properties with minimal development abut the property along its northern boundaries. A 
handful of larger lot single family homes face the property from across Greenwood Avenue to the east. A newer 
development with single family homes on smaller lots adjoins the property’s southern boundary. The general

vicinity is made up of a similar mix of land use types with the exception of existing commercial development 
clustered around the intersection of E. Ridge Pike and S. Township Line Road, approximately three-quarters of a 
mile from the subject property as the crow flies. 
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN COMPLIANCE 
While the proposal is generally consistent with the 2010 Upper Providence Comprehensive Plan, the 
Montgomery County Planning Commission (MCPC) recommends following our comments below in order to 
improve the proposal’s consistency with Goal 1 Community Character (connection of neighborhoods to parks 
and other public facilities through trails and sidewalks), Goal 3 Natural Features and Resources (preserve 
woodlands, stream valleys, and riparian buffers), Goal 4 Historic and Archaeological Resource Protection 
(encourage preservation of farmhouses, barns, and other structures), and Goal 8 Recreation and Open Space 
(provide adequate active and passive recreational opportunities).  
The proposal is also generally consistent with the county’s comprehensive plan, Montco 2020: A Shared Vision, 
which promotes the following three main themes: connected communities, sustainable places, and vibrant 
economy. This proposed project would contribute to a “vibrant economy” through its real estate investment. By 
following the recommendations below, the proposed project would better respond to the goals detailed in the 
plan for “connected communities” and “sustainable places.” 
RECOMMENDATION 
The MCPC generally supports the applicant‘s proposal, however, in the course of our review we have identified 
the following issues that the applicant and Upper Providence Township may wish to consider prior to final plan 
approval. Our comments are as follows: 
REVIEW COMMENTS  
ZONING 
A. Flexible Lot Sizes 
1. Section 182-44 of the Upper Providence Zoning code addresses the intent and requirements for 
the allowance of flexible lot sizes. 
a. Upon reviewing the “Flexible Lotting Sketch” prepared by Bohler Engineering dated 
February 10, 2020, the proposed plan appears to meet both the intent and 
requirements of this particular section of the zoning code. 
i. 
Section 182-44.B states that “flexible lotting may be permitted on tracts 
smaller than 35 acres as a conditional use when approved by the Board of 
Supervisors” if certain criteria are met. In the case of this particular 
proposal, flexible lotting would better allow for the preservation of existing 
natural features on the property as well as preserve an historic farmstead. 
MCPC supports the flexible lotting approach so that existing trees, riparian 
- 3 - 
 
Mr. Geoffrey Grace 
March 12, 2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vegetation, wetlands, and streams may be preserved to the greatest extent 
possible. 
ii. 
We would like to offer one recommendation with regard to the proposed 
lotting and that is to provide a slightly altered and slightly larger lot size for 
the historic homestead, to provide more of a buffer and preserve a slightly 
larger landscape context for this historic property. Please see the attached 
“Sketch with MCPC Recommendations” for the recommended lot 
configuration. 
OPEN SPACE 
A. Chapter 182. Zoning 
1. Section 182-43 of the Upper Providence Zoning code identifies requirements of recreation and 
open space amenities for developments on tract sizes that are greater than 15 acres. As the 
proposal is developed in more detail, the applicant should note the following: 
a. The developer “shall provide community areas, playground and tot-lots for the comfort 
and convenience of the prospective residents….” 
b. The developer “shall provide at least 10% of the total site area as usable open space.” 
2. Section 182-44.F of the Upper Providence Zoning code states that “an open space area of not 
less than 20% of the gross land area of the entire tract shall be provided.” 
B. Chapter 154. Subdivision and Land Development 
1. Article IVA of Chapter 154 specifies the general purpose and intent along with the requirements 
for open space and recreational facilities. In particular, the applicant should keep in mind the 
following requirements for open space as the proposal is developed in more detail: 
a. Open space shall be conveniently accessible to residents. 
b. Open space shall be located and designed so that it does not present a barrier to 
persons with disabilities, older people or those with strollers. 
c. Open space shall be fully usable and suitable for its purpose. 
d. Open space shall be usable for passive and/or active recreation. 
e. Open space shall have safe and easy access. 
f. Open space shall not contain stormwater management facilities. 
g. At least one accessway shall be provided to each open space area. 
2. Preserved Open Space Calculations: On the submitted Flexible Lotting Sketch, there is a table 
with the open space calculations. One of the types of areas shown as subtracted from the gross 
open space of each area is noted as “basin areas.” We are unclear as to what exactly is meant to 
be defined as a “basin area” so we would like to ensure that these calculations are subtracting 
the full detention basin area that would be constructed for stormwater management purposes 
and not just subtracting the bottom area of the basin. 
3. Recommendations for Design of Open Space: In keeping with the intent and requirements as 
outlined in Chapters 154 and 182, we have provided some general recommendations for how 
the open space could be designed. Please see the attached “Sketch with MCPC 
Recommendations” for where paths and usable open space areas could be located. 
PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE CONNECTIVITY 
- 4 - 
 
Mr. Geoffrey Grace 
March 12, 2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A. Sidewalk Connection to Knoll Drive 
1. In addition to sidewalks along both sides of the proposed internal road and paths through the 
open space areas on the property, we recommend that a sidewalk be constructed along the 
west side of Greenwood Avenue, between the proposed development and Knoll Drive to the 
south. The addition of this sidewalk would enable residents who cannot drive or do not wish to 
drive, to safely access the commercial development to the southwest by foot or bicycle. It is 
possible that a sidewalk along this stretch may or may not fall within the ultimate roadway right-
of-way. In the case that it would not, an easement would need to be obtained from the property 
located at the corner of Greenwood Avenue and Knoll Drive.  
CONCLUSION 
We wish to reiterate that MCPC generally supports the applicant’s proposal although we believe that the 
revisions recommended in this letter would better achieve Upper Providence Township’s planning objectives as 
outlined in the 2010 Upper Providence Comprehensive Plan and as required by Upper Providence Township’s 
code. 
 
Please note that the review comments and recommendations contained in this report are advisory to the 
municipality and final disposition for the approval of any proposal will be made by the municipality.  
Should the governing body approve a final plat of this proposal, the applicant must present the plan to our office 
for seal and signature prior to recording with the Recorder of Deeds office. A paper copy bearing the municipal 
seal and signature of approval must be supplied for our files. Please print the assigned MCPC number 20-0040-
001 on any plans submitted for final recording.
