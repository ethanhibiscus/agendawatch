Introduction to Electronic Means Meeting: 
Good Evening.  This meeting of the Morgantown Planning Commission is being conducted by electronic 
means consistent with the West Virginia Open Governmental Proceedings Act and the guidance of the 
West Virginia Ethics Commission due to the current State of Emergency given the outbreak of COVID-19. 
In order to mitigate the transmission of the virus and reduce risk of COVID-19 illness, we have been 
advised and directed to suspend public gatherings.  In keeping with that direction, and the authority 
provided by the Open Governmental Proceedings Act and the Ethics Commission guidance allowing the 
conduct of public meetings by electronic means so long as the public is able to observe the meeting, this 
meeting is being conducted by remote electronic participation and in-person attendance by the public is 
not permitted.  
This meeting will include a public comment portion concerning matters not on the agenda and public 
hearings for each of the cases listing on this evening’s agenda.  Members of the public will be permitted 
to comment during these portions by submitting comments in writing or by speaking during their 
designated time, if they have signed up to do so prior to the start of the meeting.  Even if members of the 
public do not provide comment, participants are advised that people may be listening who do not provide 
comment, and those persons are not required to identify themselves. 
For this meeting, the Planning Commission is convening by Cisco Webex video and telephone conference 
as posted on the City’s Website identifying how the public may join.   
Please note that this meeting is being recorded, and that some attendees are participating by video 
conference.

Meeting Business Ground Rules 
Before we turn to the first item on the agenda, permit me to cover some ground rules for effective and 
clear conduct of our business and to ensure accurate meeting minutes. 
•
Please remember to mute your phone or computer when you are not speaking.
•
Please remember to wait to be recognized by the President before speaking and to speak clearly
and in a way that helps generate accurate minutes.
•
For any response, please wait until the President yields the floor to you and state your name
before speaking.
•
If Planning Commissioners wish to engage in colloquy with other members, please do so through
the President, taking care to identify yourself.
The Planning Commission conducts business in the following order: 
(1)
There will be a general public comment portion when anyone who wishes to address the Planning
Commission may do so, but only on matters that are not on the agenda.  I will first read, or have
read, all written comments submitted, and will then review the list of public commenters who have
signed up by the meeting start time.  Once I have a list of all public commentators, I will call on each
by name.  All speakers will be limited to five (5) minutes.  If members of the Planning Commission
have any questions of the speaker, that time will not be counted toward the speaker’s five (5)
minutes.  Public speakers must state their name and address for the record.  Speakers are notified
that irrelevant comments or comments of a personal nature or personal attacks may result in the
speaker forfeiting their opportunity to participate in the general public comment portion.
(2)
We review, amend, and approve minutes of the previous meeting.
(3)
We consider any Unfinished Business from previous meetings.
(4)
We move on to New Business items.  First, we introduce the item and the Planning Division
representative presents the Staff Report.
(5)
Next, we ask the petitioner to make a presentation.  Planning Commissioners may ask the petitioner 
questions at that time.  To ensure an accurate record and to aid the preparation of meeting minutes, 
presenters and Planning Commissioners must first be recognized by the President and state your
name before proceeding.

(6)
I will then open a Public Hearing to hear testimony in support of, or in opposition to, the request.
Rules regarding public testimony are as follows:
(a)
I will first read, or have read, all written comments submitted, and will then review the list of
public commenters who have signed up by the meeting start time.
(b)
Once I have a list of all public commentators, I will call on each by name.  All speakers will be
limited to five (5) minutes.  If members of the Planning Commission have any questions of the
speaker, that time will not be counted toward the speaker’s five (5) minutes.
(c)
Public speakers must state their name and address for the record.  All comments must be
addressed to the Commission.  Speakers are notified that irrelevant comments or comments
of a personal nature or personal attacks may result in the speaker forfeiting their opportunity
to participate in the public hearing.
(d)
If there is a large number of speakers, including many who are part of groups or organizations, 
I may, to avoid repetitive comments, elect to ask for a representative to speak on behalf of
the group or organization.
(e)
I may elect to recognize the applicant/agent at the end of the public hearing to provide
rebuttal or additional comments, which will be limited to five (5) minutes.  If members of the
Commission have any questions of the applicant/agent, that time will not be counted toward
the applicant’s/agent’s five (5) minutes.
(7)
After all testimony is heard, I will declare the Public Hearing closed and no further public comment
will be permitted.  At that time, no one in the audience may speak again unless a Planning
Commissioner asks a question.  If someone is asked a question, they must first be recognized by the
President and identify themselves once again before answering.
(8)
Next, the Planning Commission will discuss and take action on the application.
(9)
Because this public meeting is being conducted by remote electronic participation and to ensure
accurate meeting minutes each vote taken during this meeting will be conducted by roll call vote.
(10)
Uncivil, unruly, and/or disruptive behavior at any time during this meeting is prohibited and will
result in removal from this public meeting.
Thank you for your consideration and respect for these proceedings and the opinions of all meeting

NEW BUSINESS:
A. RZ20-03 / West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. / 445 Van Voorhis
Road:  Request by Seth Wilson of Bowles Rice, LLP, on behalf of West Virginia 
University Hospitals, Inc. for a Zoning Map Amendment to reclassify Seventh Ward 
Tax District, Tax Map 6, Parcel 76.1 and Seventh Ward Tax District, Tax Map 11, 
Parcel 258, from OI, Office and Institutional District to B-2, Service Business District. 
Fletcher presented the Staff Report and noted the petitioner was present. 
DeMasters recognized Seth Wilson, Bowles Rice LLC, representing WVU Hospitals, Inc. who also noted 
Alan Neptune of WVU Hospitals, Inc. was present as well.  Wilson stated his client is requesting to 
rezone this parcel to adjust the boundaries of the existing B-2 District.  WVU Hospitals, Inc. wishes to 
eventually build a medical office building at the site, but there are no immediate plans.  In the short-term, 
they would use this parcel as a temporary surface parking lot.  This is not permitted under the current 
zoning.  
DeMasters asked if there were any questions.  Stranko questioned the plans for the parking lot 
concerning screening, greenspace or other aesthetic improvements or considerations.  Neptune stated 
that they have been working on the aesthetic improvements.  Installation of a three-foot-high mound 
along Van Voorhis Road and Elmer Prince Drive has been completed, which has been hydroseeded,

will somewhat hide the view of parked cars.  Neptune added there may be evergreen trees planted later.  
DeMasters asked for clarification regarding stormwater management.  Neptune stated that the lot will 
need to be paved and stormwater management facilities will be designed and installed. 
With no further comments or questions by the Planning Commission, DeMasters asked if there were 
any members of the public present to speak in favor of or in opposition to the petition.  Fletcher confirmed 
there were no electronic requests to speak on this matter.  There being no public comments, DeMasters 
asked for staff’s recommendations, which was read by Fletcher. 
DeMasters asked for discussion.  Stranko noted he is concerned about the land use scenarios, 
specifically a surface parking lot that would be permitted by-right in the B-2 District. 
Fletcher explained that if City Council approved the subject zoning map amendment, the property owner 
will be required to go through the building permit process for the surface parking lot use, which includes 
landscaping requirements.  Fletcher reiterated that the parking area use is temporary. 
Discussion ensued regarding the temporary period of the surface parking lot, the underutilization of the 
site, concern that the site is highly visible and serves as a gateway to the regional medical center, and 
the desire to ensure proper landscaping. 
Fletcher noted the temporary use permit process is authorized and enforced by the City Manager, which 
could occur regardless of the current zoning classification of the site.  Fletcher restated that the parking 
lot use would be required to go through the building permit process, which includes landscaping 
requirements. 
Wilson noted the City’s zoning regulations concerning temporary use appear to be more for seasonal 
purposes.  Fletcher reiterated that the temporary use permit process is under the authority of the City 
Manager. 
Pyles asked how many parking spaces would be provided in the temporary surface parking lot.  Neptune 
noted between 100-125 spaces. 
Fletcher noted that the ability to continue to grow WVU Hospitals, Inc. facilities is becoming more 
challenging with the limited available space to expand.  Growth on the regional medical campus results 
in higher demand for employees and related parking.  WVU Hospitals, Inc. has been forced to grow 
parking vertically with the recent addition of two parking garage facilities.  Fletcher noted the subject site 
is of high value, will serve to meet the growth needs of the regional medical facility, and the B-2 zoning 
classification provides greater flexibility for site design in terms of mixed uses.  Fletcher also noted that 
City Administration is confident the surface parking lot will not be the long-term use of the site. 
Stranko moved to forward to City Council a recommendation that they adopt the request zoning 
classification; seconded by Pyles.  Motion passed unanimously. 
Fletcher stated that he would forward the City Council meeting dates coming up over the next few 
months where it will be on their agenda, assuming it continues to progress in a positive manner.

Fletcher presented the Staff Report noting the petitioner was unable to be present and asked that Staff 
represent him.  There being no questions by the Planning Commission, DeMasters asked if there were 
any members of the public present to speak in favor of or in opposition to the petition.  Fletcher confirmed 
there were no electronic requests to speak on this matter.  There being no public comments, DeMasters 
asked for staff’s recommendations, which was read by Fletcher. 
Stranko motioned to approve the petition with staff recommended conditions; seconded by Hammond.  
Motion carried unanimously.

REQUEST and LOCATION: 
Request by Sandra McLaughlin for minor subdivision approval of property located at 448 East 
Brockway Avenue.  
TAX MAP NUMBER (s) and ZONING DESCRIPTION: 
Tax District 10, Tax Map 35, Parcels 52 and 55; R-1A, Single-Family Residential District. 
SURROUNDING ZONING: 
R-1A, Single-Family Residential District.
BACKGROUND and ANALYSIS: 
The petitioner seeks to subdivide Parcels 52 and 55 into one (1) parcel.  Addendum A of this 
report illustrates the location of the subject site.   
Parcel 52 is a legal, pre-existing nonconforming gravel parking lot associated with the adjoining 
principal structure.  Parcel 55 includes a legal, pre-existing nonconforming “Two-Family 
Dwelling” use addressed as 448 and 450 East Brockway Avenue.  Parcel 52 has 44.5-linear 
feet of lot frontage and is approximately 4,986 square feet in area.  Parcel 55 has 44.4-linear 
feet of lot frontage and is approximately 6,050 square feet in area.  The proposed parcel will 
have 88.9-linear feet of lot frontage and an approximate area of 11,036 square feet.  This 
parcel will exceed the R-1A District minimum lot frontage requirement (30-feet) and minimum 
parcel area requirement (3,500 square feet). 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 
Staff recommends approval of the minor subdivision with the following conditions: 
1.
That the petitioner submits at least three (3) original final plat documents, including all
access/utility easements, signed and sealed by a surveyor licensed in the State of
West Virginia for the Planning Commission President’s signature; and, that the final
plat is recorded at the Monongalia County Courthouse within thirty (30) days of
receiving the executed plat; or,
2.
That, in accordance with Article 1363.02(B)(3) of the City’s Planning and Zoning Code,
the petitioner place the following covenant notation on the recorded deeds for the
subject parcels and submit a certification of its recording to the Planning Division:
“For planning and zoning purposes, the lot described herein shall be considered as
part and parcel of the adjacent lot owned by <Insert Owners Names> pursuant to
deeds recorded at Deed Record Book No. <Insert Deed Book>, Page <Insert Deed
Page> in the Office of the Clerk of the County Commission of Monongalia County. The
real estate described herein shall not be considered a separate parcel of real estate
for land use, development, conveyance or transfer of ownership, without having first
obtained the expressed approval of the Morgantown City Planning Commission. This
restriction shall be a covenant running with the land.”

CASE NO: 
TX20-03 / Administrative / Wiles Hill Gateway Overlay District 
REQUEST: 
Administrative request to amend Sections 1329.02 and 1331, and create Article 1358 
WHOD, Wiles Hill Gateway Overlay District of the Planning and Zoning Code as 
recommended in the Future Study Area No. 5 – Stewart Street and Highland Avenue. 
BACKGROUND: 
Under Case No. RZ19-01, Mr. Gregg Metheny, on behalf of Scott Properties, sought to 
amend the zoning map by reclassifying 18 parcels from R-2, Single- and Two-Family 
Residential District to R-3, Multi-Family Residential District, the area of which is 
approximately 1.6 acres. Addendum A of this report provides a chronological timeline from 
Mr. Metheny’s subject zoning map amendment petition to the culmination of the present 
administrative recommendation to create the “Wiles Hill Gateway Overlay District.” 
The Future Study Area 5 – Stewart Street and Highland Avenue – Small Area Plan 
Recommendations Report completed during this period and accepted by the Planning 
Commission on 08 OCT 2019 is made a part of the Planning Commission’s record by 
reference and available for review at: 
http://www.morgantownwv.gov/DocumentCenter/View/3061/Small-Area-5-
Recommendation-Report-FINAL-10082019 
ANALYSIS: 
Immediately following the Planning Commission’s 08 OCT 2019 acceptance of the Future 
Study Area No. 5 Small Area Plan Recommendations Report, Staff continued to 
collaborate with the Wiles Hill Neighborhood working group and Mr. Metheny to create the 
“Wiles Hill Gateway Overlay District.” Staff’s recommended text amendments are provided 
in Addendum B of this report. The following summarizes salient elements of the 
recommended overlay district. 
Definition of Terms 
The definitions of three (3) new terms are included in the recommended text amendment.  
“Balcony” and “Front Gathering Space” are provided to convey guidance in meeting 
requisite design standards for all residential construction within the overlay district. 
Specifically, the residential design objective is to include an area at the front of the 
dwelling, similar to a front porch, to promote human-scaled design and encourage resident 
engagement customary to traditional neighborhoods. Given the differing typologies of 
residential structures desired within the overlay district and significant typographic 
changes, achieving a front porch feature necessitated a unique land use policy approach.  
The overlay district also introduces “Accessory Dwelling” units in one area of the overlay 
district.  Accordingly, a definition for this dwelling unit is included as provided for other

dwelling unit types in the Planning and Zoning Code. These new terms integrate with 
existing Planning and Zoning Code text and provide additional development guidance. 
Wiles Hill Gateway Overlay District (WHOD) 
The overlay district is intended to serve as a set of demonstration land use, design, and 
performance standards for new construction within the study area. The overlay district is 
divided into three (3) blocks each having unique development objectives. The legislative 
purpose of the overlay district includes: 
(A) 
Advance desired infill development and redevelopment to modestly increase 
residential densities in a transitional pattern; 
(B) 
Advance infill and redevelopment through dwelling unit diversification; and, 
(C) 
Promote construction of affordable workforce housing opportunities that includes a 
balance of owner and renter households. 
The recommended zoning text amendments provide descriptions and illustrations of the 
boundaries for each of the three (3) blocks. Also provided are land use regulations and 
development design and performance standards common to three (3) blocks that 
compose the overlay district.  Some of these elements include: 
• 
A permitted land use table is included that is specific to land uses permitted by-
right, permitted with conditional use approval, or not permitted within the overlay 
district. This table supersedes the permitted land use table controlling all zoning 
districts at Table 1331.05.01. 
• 
Supplemental design and performance regulations are provided for uses included 
in the overlay district’s permitted land use table.  Supplement regulations of note 
include: 
- 
Maximum gross floor area for permitted nonresidential uses 
- 
Accessory dwelling units 
- 
Two-family and Townhouse dwelling units 
• 
Zero-lot-line provisions for side-by-side two-family and townhouse dwellings to 
promote affordable homeownership opportunities. 
• 
A modified method of determining building height by correlating the location of the 
building with the vertical distance above the centerline grade of its frontage 
roadway, which better reflects the elevation changes across the study area and

etc.) are required with new development to encourage and provide for opportunities for 
increased community interaction. 
WHOD Blocks 
The overlay district is divided into Blocks “A,” “B,” and “C.”  Each block is further 
segmented to provide optimal development outcomes given differing terrain; desired 
terracing of building heights to ensure practical neighborhood viewshed protection; 
planned pedestrian and vehicle access to dwelling units; and, essential right-of-way 
improvements to encourage complete street design for multiple modes of mobility and 
additional opportunities for residential development. 
Block “A” includes parcels located south of 
Highland Avenue and north of portions of 
Wellen and Lorentz Avenues as shown in 
the image to the right.  This block is further 
divided into four (4) subgroups to achieve 
desired development patterns including lot 
sizes, lot frontage width, lot coverage, 
building envelop orientation.  
The purpose of Block “A” is to serve as a 
transition into the adjoining R-1A District 
while enabling creative building forms and 
moderately higher detached single-family 
densities that incentivize infill and redevelopment of underutilized, functionally obsolete, 
and/or nonconforming properties. 
The goal in planning for Block “A” is to provide for a transition from the northern detached 
single-family dwellings and allow for slightly higher density development, that still 
maintains the physical form of the higher elevation properties in the neighborhood. This 
block allows for the inclusion of subordinate Accessory Dwelling Units to be located as 
part of the principal dwelling or as a separate structure.  In addition to increased residential 
density, structures will be required to provide some enclosed/garage parking spaces. The 
public right-of-way is proposed to be improved with minimal on-street parking and new 
sidewalk construction. 
Block “B” includes parcels that may 
support development with frontages on 
Lorentz Avenue as shown in the image to 
the right. This block group is divided into two 
(2) subgroups, with southern facing parcels 
in one subgroup and northern facing parcels 
in the other sub-group. 
The purpose of Block “B” is to serve as a 
transition between Blocks “A” and “C” while 
enabling 
creative 
building 
forms 
and 
moderately higher densities than Block “A”

to incentivize redevelopment of existing nonconforming rental properties. Two-Family and 
Townhouse designs are preferred for this block. 
New structures on the northern side of Lorentz Avenue will have parking accessible from 
Lorentz Avenue, while parking for new southern side structures will be required to be 
accessed from First Street. Designs will include outdoor areas located in the front of the 
structure as either a porch or patio feature. 
Block “C” is the southernmost area of the overlay 
district and includes the Jones Place development 
and parcels bordered by Jones Avenue, Stewart 
Street, and remaining and annulled portions of 
First Street as shown in the image to the right. 
The purpose of Block “C” is to foster development, 
built into the hillside, of moderately higher 
densities than Block “B” that provides an attractive 
gateway into the Wiles Hill neighborhood. 
Block “C” provides for a full transition to higher 
density multi-family dwellings and compatible 
mixed-use development.  Overall development is 
limited in height to preserve views from 
development located to the north. Vehicular 
access is limited to Jones Avenue and First Street, with site design standards to 
encourage terraced development, utilizing the natural topography.  The area within Block 
“C” between First Street, Stewart Street, and Jones Avenue was the realty included in Mr. 
Metheny’s zoning map amendment petition under Case No. RZ19-01. 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION: 
Staff would be inattentive if it did not acknowledge Mr. Gregg Metheny for his patience 
and willingness to delay Planning Commission consideration of his zoning map 
amendment petition [Case No. RZ19-01] and ultimate development schedule to collaborate 
with Wiles Hill Neighborhood residents and the City through the small area study process 
and the development of the recommended overlay district. Staff also recognizes the 
commitment of time, attention, and care by the Wiles Hill Neighborhood working group of 
Charlie Byrer, Zackery Cruze, Richard Dumas, Frank Scafella, and Margaret Stout. The 
contributions of these stakeholders over the past 18 months have ensured the 
presentation of a grassroots, participatory-driven set of land use and development policies 
ready for enactment. 
Staff respectfully advises the Planning Commission to forward a favorable 
recommendation to City Council to amend the Planning and Zoning Code as presented in 
Addendum B of this Staff Report based on the information and findings presented herein.

Zoning Map Amendment Case No. RZ19-01 
December 2018 
On 07 DEC 2018, Gregg Metheny, on behalf of Scott Properties, submitted a Zoning Map 
Amendment petition for approximately 1.6 acres or property bounded by Jones Avenue, Stewart 
Street, and annulled and remaining portions of First Street.  The request sought to reclassify the 
realty from R-2, Single and Two-Family Residential to R-3, Multi-Family Residential.  Information 
related to that zoning map amendment petition is included in the Planning Commission’s record 
under Case No. RZ19-01. 
January 2019 
A Planning Commission public hearing for that petition was held on 10 JAN 2019 and the matter 
was tabled based on the following two findings:  
1. The Planning Commission believes it needs more holistic information given the fact the subject site 
is located within “Future Study Area No. 5” identified in the 2013 Comprehensive Plan Update. 
Please see Addendum B of the Staff Report presented to the Planning Commission for the subject 
zoning map amendment petition for additional information concerning “Future Study Area No. 5.”  
2. The Planning Commission noted it is prudent to respect the resources of the 2013 Comprehensive 
Plan Update and directed the Planning Division to initiate a small area study planning project for 
“Future Study Area No. 5”, by reporting a related scope and schedule for same at the THU, 14 FEB 
2019 Planning Commission meeting.  
February 2019 
Under an existing on-call professional planning services contract, staff met with AECOM on 06 
FEB 2019 to develop a scope of work to complete the Future Study Area No. 5 Plan.  The scope 
included two (2) community forums and stakeholder meetings to establish effective public 
participation for the planning process.  Staff provided the Planning Commission with this and 
additional information at its 14 FEB 2019 hearing.  The item was taken from the table and the 
public hearing reopened.  Following opposition to the petition, the Mr. Metheny provided rebuttal 
and expressed a willingness for the City to complete the Future Study Area No. 5 Plan 
Recommendations Report prior to the Planning Commission deciding on a recommendation to 
City Council on Mr. Metheny’s zoning map amendment petition.  After discussion, the Planning 
Commission voted unanimously to table the petition again to explore the planning project further 
with Mr. Metheny. 
March 2019 
At the 14 MAR 2019 Planning Commission hearing, the zoning map amendment petition was 
removed from the table and the following motion was unanimously passed: 
To postpone further consideration of RZ19-01 until the next regular business meeting following 
completion and acceptance of the recommendations report on Future Study Area No. 5 by the 
Planning Commission, with the understanding the petitioner may at any time request the Planning 
Commission to remove the matter from the table and proceed with consideration and 
recommendation action thereby safeguarding the petitioner’s right to due process; provided, said 
request to remove the matter from the table prior to completion and acceptance of the Future Study 
Area No. 5 Recommendations Report must be submitted in writing by the published application

deadline for the following Planning Commission regular business meeting. The motion was 
seconded by Shuman and carried unanimously. 
Future Study Area No. 5 – Small Area Plan 
April 2019 
The first community forum was held on 17 APR 2019 with 25 residents in attendance.  Chris 
Rogers, AICP with AECOM provided a presentation examining the Future Study Area 5 zoning 
issues and the small area planning process.  After the presentation, public comments were taken 
involving design and community character; housing; slope and soil stability; and, general 
questions regarding the process.  A walking tour of the area was conducted with 15 of the forum 
attendees participating.  During the month of May, individual stakeholder meetings were held.  
June 2019 
Starting in June 2019, Development Services staff began collaborating with a working group of 
Wiles Hill neighborhood residents that included Charlie Byrer, Zackery Cruze, Richard Dumas, 
Frank Scafella, and Margaret Stout.  A series of meetings with the working group were held in the 
summer of 2019 resulting in a revised focus on the study area, moving away from the broader 
plan objectives typically completed for Future Study Areas.  Specifically, the project focused on 
individual blocks within the study area containing unique characteristics and transformative 
development opportunities connecting the traditional neighborhood of Wiles Hill to the edge of the 
Sunnyside Neighborhood at Jones Avenue.  This intensive analytic approach evolved into a set 
of overlay district principles intended to shape the design focus of the Future Study Area No. 5 
Plan Recommendations Report.  
September 2019 
The second and final community forum was held on 18 SEP 2019 with approximately 18 
attendees. The block concept and design focus were presented with general consensus achieved 
on moving forward with the final recommendations report and a future zoning overlay district.  
Staff continued to brief and work with Mr. Metheny through the Future Study Area No. 5 planning 
process. 
October 2019 
A draft recommendations report for the Future Study Area No. 5 was completed in late September 
2019 and forwarded to the Planning Commission for acceptance.  On 08 OCT 2019, a public 
hearing was held for the Future Study Area No. 5 Recommendations Report and unanimously 
accepted by the Planning Commission. 
March 2020 
The Planning Commission conducted a workshop following its March business meeting.  Staff 
presented an update of the collaborative work with stakeholders to develop the Wiles Hill Gateway 
Overlay District.
