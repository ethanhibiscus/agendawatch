2 STAFF COMMENTS /  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
1. As a general note, whenever an application that was previously reviewed is resubmitted, it is 
helpful to the review process if prior proposals are included with the new submission side by 
side. This helps reviewers to clearly understand what has changed.  
2. The proposed revision includes removal of two existing windows on North Elevation. Even 
though these windows are not visible from the street, it would be preferable if the removed 
windows were reused elsewhere in the project, such as in the noted locations for window type 
A in the floorplan on sheet A101. Regarding Elevation Note 11, casing and projected sills of 
removed windows should be removed and installed/adapted to new location. Ensure siding 
used to patch remaining openings is similar to surrounding siding and is woven seamlessly with 
existing siding.    
3. The proposed revision creates a simplified and more appropriate gable condition at the rear of 
the structure.  
4. Drawing B on Sheet A101 includes a diagonal line and space where new siding meets existing 
siding. We believe this is a graphic representation of the intersection between existing and new, 
but to be clear, the new siding should be woven seamlessly into place with the existing.   
5. Please submit gutters and downspouts for review. Include material and profile.  
6. All new/relocated windows shall have casing and sills to match existing.  
7. With regards to new addition, match all similar conditions found on the existing building, 
including but not limited to termination of siding to foundation, corner boards, siding to 
decking, fascias, soffits, etc.  
8. Any decorative lighting fixtures associated with rear modifications should be submitted. 
Staff recommendation: Final approval of Change After Certification with conditions noted above and 
Final Details to Staff for review.

2 STAFF COMMENTS /  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
1. Comments pertaining to Garage (STAFF REVIEW):  
a. Applicant’s proposed details for garage are generally positive and in keeping with past 
comments for the project.  
b. Window detail noted on sheet A.07 is acceptable for the garage, and the garage door is 
approved as proposed, however, spacer bars must be provided in glass of new doors 
and windows of garage.   
c. Submit profile of top rail of balcony.  
 
2. Comments pertaining to the Main House and Rear Addition (BOARD REVIEW):  
a. Applicant’s alterations to main house and proposed rear addition are generally positive: 
Removal of three dormer windows from main structure is a positive change, as it brings 
the building back to its historic form. Making minimal alterations to the front exterior is 
also a positive approach. New addition in rear of structure is properly scaled and 
subordinate to main structure. New entrance where rear addition meets main house is 
open and airy and provides a visible separation between old and new.  
b. The masonry steps on the front elevation date back at least to the 1970s when the John 
Milner Survey was created. Given that these steps are likely historic elements, staff does 
not support removal of masonry steps and replacement with wood steps. Applicant 
should restore and maintain existing masonry steps. Applicant to submit details for 
wood railing over front masonry steps.    
c. Applicant to consider different material for exterior of gas fireplace on East Elevation at 
the screen porch. The current design incudes wood cladding around the fireplace, 
whereas this should read as a masonry structure. Copper or metal flashing would be 
appropriate at the top of this structure. Detailing and material choices here should be 
distinguishable from historic elements.  
d. Provide details for new wood steps and railing off screen porch on East Elevation of 
existing structure.  
e. Ensure that area where window is removed on East elevation of main house is patched 
back with siding that is similar to the surrounding existing siding. If window proposed for 
removal from main house is an historic window, the applicant should consider reusing 
the window elsewhere in the project if possible.  
f. Applicant proposes a casement egress window for the second-floor bedroom on the 
rear elevation of the main house. Since this window is in the rear , is provided for 
required egress from the interior of the house, and is within an alteration that was 
possibly added to the main structure in the 1980s, the staff supports this Anderson A 
Series casement window. The window must include spacer bars between glass. This 
casement window must have wood casing and sill to match the rest of the main house. 
Azek trim is only acceptable for the garage and the rear addition windows, but not for 
the main house.  
g. Operable shutters on front elevation must be wood instead of PVC/Fiberglass. Please 
submit a cutsheet for wood shutters as well as for operable hardware. Staff 
recommends Sapele or other similar rot resistant paintable wood. Shutters proposed for 
the rear addition are acceptable as PVC/Fiberglass. Please submit cut sheet for Bahama 
Style shutter and hardware proposed for rear addition.  
h. Applicant to ensure that operable shutters fully cover associated windows when closed.  
i. 
Standing Seam Metal Roof is appropriate for structure. Please submit detail of seam 
(folded seam) and panel width.  
j. 
Please submit more information about gutters and downspouts. Please note where 
downspouts will be located and submit cutsheets of downspouts and gutters that 
include size and material. Please note that corrugated downspouts are unacceptable.  
k. Boral siding proposed for rear addition is acceptable, but it must be smooth.  
l. 
There does not appear to be metal flashing at skirt board drip cap showing in Wall 
Section at Addition on Sheet A.08. Staff feels that metal flashing in this location will 
provide pleasing transition as well as durability.  
m. Mechanical equipment screen on Right-Side elevation of rear addition is appropriate for 
the structure. Emergency generator should be screened in the same manner.  
n. All proposed lighting is appropriate for the structure.  
o. Applicant to ensure that new pavers in the project should either match or complement 
existing pavers. If proposed pavers are different from existing, please submit paver for 
review.  
p. Applicant to ensure that planting around front elevation does not overwhelm the porch 
when fully matured.  
Staff recommendation: Preliminary approval of Main House and Rear Addition with staff conditions 
noted and final details to staff.

Smooth Nickel Gap/Woodgrain Shiplap
TruExterior.com
TruExterior® Siding & Trim’s new reversible 
profile comes in two formats: one features 
smooth Nickel Gap on one side and 
wood-grain Shiplap on the other; the 
second has woodgrain Nickel Gap on 
one side and smooth Shiplap on the 
other. A rabbeted edge ensures panels fit 
together perfectly to create the authentic 
spacing—the tight joint appearance of 
Shiplap on one side and the nickel-sized 
space of Nickel Gap on the other. Like 
other TruExterior products, the new profile 
comes pre-primed and does require paint.

ADDITIONAL RAIL
Add a third horizontal rail to
underscore the clean, crisp lines of
true open louvers. Our open louver
shutters deliver authenticity and
timeless aesthetics as they let light
and breezes ~ow through.
Innovative materials and
engineering ensure that Atlantic
louvers will not warp, rot or bow,
unlike wood louvers—nor will they
require painstaking painting.

● Rails: Structural PVC with smooth
outer skin
● Louvers/Stiles: Pultruded

2 STAFF COMMENTS /  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
1. This project involves closing in an existing porch in a nonconforming structure. The existing 
porch structure currently encroaches 18.5” into the setback around the property. The applicant 
is proposing that the porch be closed in and that the stairs be reconstructed to allow an 
approach from the side rather than the rear.  
2. Per Section 11.4.3 of the Beaufort Code, expansion of a nonconforming structure is allowed as 
long as the proposed expansion does not encroach further into the setback than the existing 
expansion. Per Section 2.5.6, Part E of the Beaufort Code, stairs may encroach to within 5 feet of 
any interior side and rear property line. As the proposed enclosure of the existing porch does 
not cause further encroachment into the setback than the existing expansion, and as the 
proposed stairway is clearly more than five feet away from the property line, this project is in 
compliance with zoning guidelines.   
3. North wall of enclosure should tuck behind existing corner board. If this is not possible, corner 
board should be maintained to delineate between old and new.   
4. New siding should be different from existing siding. Shiplap siding would be an appropriate 
choice. Applicant to add corner boards.  
5. New siding, window casing, and heavy projected sills should all be wood. All casing and sills on 
new windows should match casing on the rest of the house.  
6. Windows on West Elevation should be symmetrical. Staff supports reuse of the existing window 
on the right side of new addition, however, the window on the left side should be identical in 
size or should be eliminated. Staff recommends reuse of existing door on West Elevation.  
7. New Windows should be wood, true divided light, with clear glass.  
8. The new roof canopy proposed over the rear door on the West Elevation is too visually heavy.  
The new roof canopy should fall below the existing roof line and should not engage with the 
existing roof.  
9. Staff supports matching the existing railing for the new stairs to grade and using stained wood 
and matching wood caps. Please provide details of the railing, including but not limited to 
termination of railing at siding.   
10. Intersection of siding, skirt board, and foundation for the enclosure should be consistent with 
existing details. At minimum, provide a wall section through the enclosure that shows these 
details.  
11. Applicant to submit details showing how portion of new roof at northwest corner will be 
resolved with existing roof and rafter tails. Applicant to submit roofing material.  
12. Louvered foundation screen that matches those on the rest of the building should be included 
below the new stairs. 
13. Applicant to submit plan for lighting new buildout that includes cut sheets for lighting fixtures.  
 
Staff recommendation: Final approval of Rear Enclosure with staff conditions noted and final details to 
staff.

New Heated = 82 Sq. Feet, New Stoop = 27 Sq. Feet
1. Enclose existing covered and open rear porch to create new heated area for
new Laundry and Mud room (West side of property).
2. Add new Stoop with stairs (West side of property).
Note: To enable the new addition to comply with the current zoning setbacks at the
rear of the property, The Historic Review Board would need to approve
a modulation of the setback line, before proceeding with the review of the
addition to the residence. The footprint of the existing covered porch extends
approximately 18.5" into the existing 15' rear setback.
