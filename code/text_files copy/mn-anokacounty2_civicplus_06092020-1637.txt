Financial  Overview
 of Senior  Housing  Projects  and 2021 Budgets
Karen  Skepper,  Executive
 Director
Background
The  Anoka  County  HRA  owns  and  operates
 four  senior  housing  apartment
 buildings
 listed  in the
chart  below,
The  HRA's  senior  housing  development
 began  in the  mid  to late  1
 990's.  At  that  time,  independent
senior  housing  had become
 an established
 product
 in the  housing  industry.  
However,
 the  private
sector,  by and large,  was  not  bringing  the product
 to Anoka  County.  
Several  communities
 in the
County  requested
 assistance
 from  the HRA  to construct
 independent
 senior  living,  and each  of
the paficipating
 communities
 contributed
 land, credit  enhancement
 on the bonds  and/or  other
resources
 to their  respective
 projects.  
Moderately
 priced,  high  quality  buildings
 were  constructed
in the  Cities  of Ham  Lake,  Ramsey,  and  Centerville.
 The  HRA  financed
 the  properties
 and  owns
and manages
 them  through
 a fee  management
 company.
 The  buildings
 offer  independent
 senior
housing  to low-  and moderate-income
 seniors,  with  priority  given  to Anoka  County  residents.
The  fourth  senior  building  was  developed
 in 2004  in
 the  City  of Oak  Grove.  
Again,  this  building
was  developed
 in
 partnership
 with  the City, 
and as part  of a
 larger  redevelopment
 project  to
remove  blighted  property
 from  the  neighborhood
 around  Lake  George,  where  crime  and  the  septic
system  were  both  problems.

Three  of  the  projects
 (The  Oaks  of Lake  George,  Chauncey
 Barett  Gardens,
 and  Savannah
 Oaks)
are financed  with  revenue  bonds  backed  by a
 general  obligation
 ("G.0.")  pledge  from  Anoka
County.
 
The  Willows  is financed
 with  revenue  bonds  backed  by the City  of Ham  Lake's  G.0.
pledge.  
The  HRA  has  pledged  all or a
 portion  of  the  levy  it collects  in the  respective
 cities  to fund
project  shortfalls,
 should  they  occur,  and has  used  the  levy  to pay  for  capital  improvements.
When  the  first  three  projects  were  financed,
 it was  the  intent  of  the  HRA  Trustees
 to use  the  levy
annually
 to keep  the  projects  affordable.
 The  policy  emphasis
 was  to keep  annual  rent  increases
at or below  the  cost  ofliving
 increases
 provided
 by Social  Security.
 The  HRA  levy  was  accordingly
used  to pay  for  capital  improvements
 and for debt  service  as needed.  More  recently,  the HRA
Board  has  sought  to make  the projects
 financially
 self-sufficient
 and implemented
 rent  increases
of 2-3%  
per year.  
The 
annual  
budget  
process  
has 
been  the 
mechanism
 
for 
balancing
 the
competing
 goals  of affordability
 and  financial
 self-sufficiency
 for  each  project.
Budget  Process
In
 the summer
 of each  year,  the HRA  Trustees
 consider
 the annual  budget  for each  project.
Ehlers  was  requested
 to review  the  proposed
 budgets
 as prepared
 by Great  Lakes  Management
and HRA  staff,  and  to prepare  this  overview.  
The  2021 budget  packet  includes:
1. 
Operating
 Budget  Narrative
 and  Capital  Improvement
 Budget;  and
2. 
Budgetworksheetsthatshowsthehistoricalfinancialperformanceoftheprojectsandthe
proposed
 2021 budget.
The  team  has carefully
 reviewed
 all budget  line items  and is
 proposing
 2021 
budgets  that  limit
the  annual  operating
 expenditure
 increases.
Proposed
 Rent  Increases
Small  but  steady  rent  increase
 will  compound
 over  time  to generate
 stable  long-term
 revenue
 and
will 
also 
provide  
predictability
 for seniors  
and 
their  families.
 
The  
proposed
 
2021 
budgets
propose
 rent  increases
 of 1.50%.  The proposed
 1.5%  rent  increase  is
 smaller  than  recent
increases
 to reflect  the  difficult  economic
 environment
 tenants  are  facing.  A 1.5%  rent  increase
 is
$12  to $25  per  month depending
 on the unit and  the properly.
Capital  Improvement
 Budgets
The  senior  housing  
buildings  range  in
 age from  16 to 23 years  and are facing  the need  for
increased
 capital  improvements.
 
Rents  and accumulated
 project  reserves
 are not sufficient
 to
fund  1
 00%  of  the  identified
 capital  needs  at each  building  over  the  next  five  years.  
The  HRA  levy
Anoka  County  Housing  and Redevelopment
 Authority
Senior  Housing  Projects
 and  2021 Budgets
Page  2
accumulated
 for each  community
 is available  to pay for upcoming  projects  and will be needed  for
all of the properties.
 Additional
 funding  sources  will need  to be identified  for capital  improvements
at Chauncey
 Barett  Gardens,  where  the levy  is projected  to be insufficient
 over  the next  five  years.
Management
 Contract
 Renewal
The HRA  contracts  with Great  Lakes  Management
 to lease,  manage,  and maintain  the
properties.  
The  contract  is up for renewal  and Great  Lakes  Management
 has requested  a
management
 fee  that  is
 equal  to 4.25%  of effective  revenue.  
Under  the current  contract  the
HRA  has paid management
 fees  of approximately
 3.8%  of effective  revenue.  Management
 fees
typically  range  from  3.5%  to 5% for  multifamily
 properties  and are on the higher  end for more
affordable  developments.
 
The  proposed  2021 budgets  include  the requested  fee increase.
The  Willows
 of Ham  Lake
This project  has historically  performed  well financially  because  it
 has its own well and septic
system  and does  not pay city utilities.  It also has had historically
 strong  occupancy.
 The  2020  net
income  is expected  to be approximately
 $77,876.
2021  
Budget  - The proposed  budget  shows  the project  is
 expected  to have  positive
net income  of $73,860  with  a
 1.5%  rent increase.  It includes  a
 1.8%  increase  in
 operating
expenses,  and assumes  97% occupancy.
 Current  occupancy
 is
 1
 00%.
The  following  graph  indicates  that  The  Willows  will maintain  a
 positive  net cashflow  over  the long
term  (prior  to capital  improvements)
 if rents  increase  2% or more  annually.

Savannah
 Oaks  operated
 at a deficit  each  year  prior  to 2012  because
 the  HRA  chose  to use  cash
reserves
 to keep  rents  more  affordable.
 
Beginning
 in
 2012,  the project  has had positive  net
income.  Net income  of $75,380
 is expected  in 2020.  The  project  maintains
 healthy  cash  balances
which  will be needed  to replace  the  air conditioning
 units.

Chauncey
 Barett  Gardens
Historically,
 the  HRA  has  contributed
 a
 portion  of its HRA  levy  from  the  City  of Centerville
 towards
annual  debt  service  on Chauncey
 Barett  Gardens.  
However,
 the  bonds  that  financed
 the  property
were  refunded
 in 2019,  significantly
 lowering
 annual  debt  service  and  allowing  the project  to have
positive cashflow
 (before capital improvements).  The  projected net income  for  2020  is $33,849.
2021
 Budget  - The proposed budget shows  a net income  of $33,045
 with a
 1.5%  rent
increase.
 
Expenses
 are proposed
 to increase  2.2%  and 97%  occupancy
 is
 budgeted.
Current
 occupancy
 is 1
 00%.
The  following
 graph  shows  that  Chauncey
 Barett  Gardens
 will need  to have  annual  rent
increases
 of 3% to sustain  positive  net operating
 income  (prior  to capital  improvements)
 over
the  long-term.

 2021 Budget  Narrative

PROJECT
 SUMMARY
Chauncey
 Barett  Gardens  is
 a
 47-unit  senior  housing  development
 in
 Centerville.
 
The
first  phase  of the project,  containing
 16 units,  was  completed
 and leased  in
 1999.  
The
second  phase  was  constructed
 in
 2004  and has higher  rents  due  to higher  construction
costs.  The  project  is currently
 100%  occupied.
A 1.6%  rate  increase
 would
 result
 in the  following
 rents:
