On May 19, 2020, Economic Development staff presented a 10-Point Plan for 
Recovery, Resiliency, and Reinvestment to help mitigate the financial impacts of 
the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The 10-Point Plan provided 
different program ideas to support the business community.  Staff also presented 
several options for use of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) 
supplemental funding received through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, And 
Economic Security Act (CARES Act). City Council requested that staff return with 
more information regarding certain proposed programs and potential funding 
allocations to benefit both residents and businesses. 
 
Recommended Action: 
 
Staff recommends that the City Council approve the allocation $186,148 of CDBG 
supplemental funding to the Housing Relief Program, Small Business Grant 
Program, and Senior Meal Program, direct staff to administer the programs, and 
increase the expenditure appropriation and revenue accounts accordingly in 
Fund 185.
