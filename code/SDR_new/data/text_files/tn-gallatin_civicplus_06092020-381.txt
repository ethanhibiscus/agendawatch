CITY OF GALLATIN, TENNESSEE
WOOL HAWK ANNEXATION FEASIBILITY STUDY
June 9,2020
INTRODUCTION
The City of Gallatin has experienced a steady growth rate over the past thirty years. According to the
United States Census Bureau, the population in the City of Gallatin increased from 23,230 in 2000 to
30,278 in 20 I 0. A special census conducted by the City in 201 5 indicated a population of 34,473 and the
2018 population is estimated to be 40,457 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). For purposes of this study a
population of 40,000 was assumed.
Gallatin's growth is due in large part to its location and accessibility to the Nashville metropolitan area.
Several major roadway projects recently have been completed or are under development that will improve
Gallatin's accessibility to the surrounding Nashville metropolitan area.In addition, the City's business
recruitment efforts and excellent quality of life have enabled the City of Gallatin to attract many new
residential, retail, office, and industrial developments.
The City of Gallatin expects the growth in the City and surrounding area to continue and rapidly increase
over the next 5 to l0 years. This growth is expected to occur rapidly on the west side of Gallatin between
Long Hollow Pike (SR- 174) and Nashville Pike (US-3 I E/SR-6) and more gradually on the north, south,
and east sides of the City. The Gallatin on the Move 2020 General Development and Transportation PIan
established the land use and transportation policies for Gallatin and the sumounding area through2020.
Several major roadways and other infrastructure projects have been constructed or are under development
to prepare for this growth.
In 1998, the Tennessee General Assembly approved Chapter ll0l, which amended Tennessee Code
Annotated, Title 6, Chapters 51 and 58, requiring local governments to establish growth plans including
an urban growth boundary (UGB) and a comprehensive plan.
The city's UGB Plan was established to accommodate the city's growth over the 20 year study period
(1999-2019). The UGB encompasses 53 square miles (about 34,000 acres) while the current city boundary
encompasses 32.61 square miles. The City projected the possibility of having to provide necessary urban
services within much of the UGB during this time period. This includes, but is not limited to, police, fire,
sanitation, streets, leisure services, electric, gas, water, sewer, codes administration, engineering, and
planning and zoning services. The Urban Growth Boundary now is being evaluated and, if necessary, may
be adjusted to accommodate growth needs for the next 20 years.
PURPOSE OF STUDY AND STUDY AREA
The purpose of this Annexation Study is to evaluate the feasibility of annexing five (5) parcels totaling
524.14 */- acres (Tax Map//Parcel - llll/002.00; ll2ll0I3.02; (P/O) 10511047.00; (P/O) 105//048.00; and
lllllll8.00), located south of Roundtree Drive, west of Brights Lane, and north of Hartsville Pike.
(Location Map - Map 1). In April 2020, the property owners and owners' agent petitioned the city for
Wool Hawk Annexation Feasihility Study
Page I of 15
06/09/2020 Council Work Session Agenda-Page 13
annexation of the contiguous properties, which are currently vacant except for one residence.
Prior to 2015, municipalities were permitted to annex properties by Ordinance without the consent of the
affected property owners. The Tennessee General Assembly amended the annexation statutes (Tennessee
Code Annotated $6-51-104(d)) to limit annexation to property owners who petition the city or by
referendum. In addition, annexations, with few exceptions, must occur within the Urban Growth
Boundary. Since 2015, all City of Gallatin annexations were the result of petitions submitted by the
property owners and were adopted by resolution.
Municipalities will typically consider annexation for the following reasons:
o To ensure the orderly future growth of the City and its surrounding areas;
o To ensure unified planning and zoning regulations and enforcement consistent with the adopted
Comprehensive Plan and UGB plan;
o To protect or enhance the current and future municipal tax base;
o To increase the size and population of the community;
o To distribute the cost of providing municipal services more equitably and to facilitate the long-
range planning for the provisions of those services; and
o To coordinate municipal services.
The City of Gallatin shares similar motivations for considering the annexation of the area included in this
study and, in particular, because the land will provide additional opportunity to transform the area to
promote economic development. In addition, the area being studied is located within the Gallatin UGB,
and the City has a vested interest in ensuring the orderly future growth and development of the area in
accordance with City standards including the Comprehensive Plan.
The rezoning request accompanying the annexation petition would change the zoning from RIA (County)
and MDRPUD (County) to the lR-[ndustrial Restrictive District. No site plan is included with this
rezoning request.

CITY OF GALLATIN RECENT ANNEXATION HISTORY
The City was most recently chartered in 1953. Many annexations and de-annexations have occurred
since this time. All of the property annexed into the City between 2000 and 2015 has been at the request
of individual property owners or initiated by the City. Since mid-2015, all annexations have occurred by
resolution upon submittal and a petition submitted by the property owner and approved by the City. The
C ity approved one non-contiguous annexation in 2}t7-Langford Farms (File No.6-630 I - I 7) and
another in early 2020 for The Meadows project, which is subject to approval of an Interlocal Agreement
with the county. Exhibit A lists all of the annexations that occurred between 1953 and the present.
PLAN OF SERVICE REQUIREMENTS
Before any territory may be annexed, the governing body shall adopt a plan of services establishing the
services to be delivered and the projected timing of the services (Tennessee Code Annotated $6-51-102).
The plan of services shall be reasonable with respect to the scope of services to be provided and the timing
of the services. The plan of services shall include, but not be limited to: police protection, fire protection,
water service, electrical service, sanitary sewer service, solid waste collection, road and street construction
and repair, recreational facilities and programs, street lighting, and zoning services. However, T.C.A.
Section 6-51-102 (a) (2), exempts a plan of service by the municipal service provider if a private entity
provides these services. Upon annexation, the property will also be considered for Industrial zoning. All
property owners in the annexed territory shall be entitled to the full benefits afforded to property owners
in the City.
With this annexation, the property will be zoned for industrial uses. No specific level of service or cost is
established for non-residential uses. Therefore, where appropriate, staff employs a methodology that
evaluates the annexation service levels based on the service level applied throughout the City on a ratio of
the current acreage and the proposed acreage to the city. Based on the overall current acreage within city
limits (approximately 32.58 square miles or 20,850 acres per the Gallatin GIS Department), an increase
of approxim ately 524 acres would result in a2.5%o increase in land within the City.
URBAN PUBLIC SERVICES INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
Public Utilities - Water, Sanitary Sewer. and Gas
The Gallatin Public Utilities Department provides water, wastewater, and natural gas services to
residential, business, and industrial customers in the City of Gallatin and in certain areas outside the City's
corporate limits. The Gallatin Public Utilities Department indicates that there is sufficient water, sanitary
sewer, and natural gas infrastructure in this area to support the proposed annexation, although not all
properties in the proposed annexation currently have water, sanitary sewer, and/or natural gas services
available.
The Gallatin on the Move 2020 Plan was adopted by the Gallatin Municipal-Regional Planning
Commission on February 23,2009. This plan includes recommendations for implementing public facility
and service improvements and identifies specific objectives to accomplish these recommendations (Page
6-10, Gallatin on the Move 2020 PIan.). Among these are the following:
Objective: Require infrastructure to be in place for growth, Iimit sewer infrastructure to the city limits
(page 2-3).
Objective: Prohibit development unless adequate infrastructure is in place or cqn be provided by the
developer.
Wool Hawk Annexation Feasibility Study
Page 4 of 15
06/09/2020 Council Work Session Agenda-Page 16
Objective: Build sewer and water treatment facilities to accommodate growth over the next 20 years
Objective: Extend utilities to reach developable areas within the City boundaries
Several strategies or policies were also identified in reaching these objectives including
Research opportunities to coordinate with other jurisdictions to deliver City expanded services.
Implement plans to expand sewer and water treatment facilities.
Develop long-range utility expansion plans consistent with the Community Vision described in
the Community Character Map.
Maintain existing City policy requiring annexation in order to extend sewer and other city-
operated utilities to new developments.
The developer will be responsible for all costs associated with the water and sanitary sewer and gas service
infrastructure improvements necessary to support the annexation and development of these properties.
Specific improvement requirements will be evaluated at the site plan stage.
Planned Sanitary Sewer Projects and Revenues
The Public Utilities Department (GPU) will provide sanitary sewer service to the area upon annexation
Sanitary sewer line extensions will be required to and within any development proposed for the
annexation area. The central sewer lines will be extended from existing lines along Gateway Drive.
Extension and construction of sewer lines within and in the vicinity of the properties will be the
responsibility of the developer. Upon completion, the City may accept any public infrastructure
improvements.
Planned Water Line Projects and Revenues
The area proposed to be annexed is currently served by Castalian Springs-Bethpage Water Utility
District. However, the Public Utilities Department (GPU) will provide water service to the area upon
annexation. Water lines will be extended from existing lines along Gateway Drive. Extension and
construction of water lines within and in the vicinity of the properties will be the responsibility of the
developer. Upon completion, the City may accept any public infrastructure improvements.
Public Utility Gas Service and Revenues
The Public Utilities Department (GPU) provides gas service in the area. Gas lines will be extended from
existing lines along Gateway Drive. Extension and construction of gas lines within and in the vicinity of
the properties will be the responsibility of the developer. Upon completion, the City may accept any public
infrastructure improvements.
Public Utility Staff
No additional employees or equipment is needed to provide service in the annexation area.
Electrical Service
The Gallatin Department of Electricity (GDE) provides electrical distribution service throughout the City
Wool Hawk Annexation Feasibility Study
Page 5 of 15
06/09/2020 Council Work Session Agenda-Page 17
of Gallatin. Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation (CEMC) is the primary service provider for
customers located outside of the City limits, including to the proposed annexation site. The source of
electricity would change with the annexation of the subject properties.
The Gallatin Department of Electricity indicates that additional electrical infrastructure would be
necessary to provide service to this area. The department also indicates that GDE would only provide
temporary power while Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) would provide permanent power for future
large-scale development within the proposed annexation area.
Recreational Facilities and Programs
The Leisure Services Department provides recreational and athletic services for both city residents and
non-residents. Leisure Services actively operates approximately 486+ acres of recreationallathletic parks
facilities/properties and open space including a 136-acre, 18-hole, municipal golf course on Long Hollow
Pike and a multi-purpose Civic Center which is used for a variety of civic, sports and recreational
activities. In addition, the City has approximately 193 acres of Army Corps of Engineers park/recreational
facilities within or adjacent to the city. The City Recreation Department maintains and operates facilities
within some of these areas.
On April 16,2019, the City Council acquired 67.9 +/- acres of property in three (3) locations around the
City. At the publishing of this report, no formal plans have been drafted for the future use of these
properties. The department responsible for the maintenance and programming of these areas is not known
at this time. These areas are not included in the overall park acreage calculations and annual maintenance
budget projections.
The benefit and use of all recreational facilities and programs currently provided by the City of Gallatin
will be available to owners of the subject property after the effective date of the annexation and will be
provided with existing personnel, facilities, and resources.
Due to the nature of the proposed industrial zoning, any financial effect on recreational facilities and
programs will be insignificant.
Putllic Works -
Wasfe Collection
The Public Works Department provides residential solid waste collection and disposal services throughout
the City. Additionally, it provides brush collection/disposal and junk collection/disposal services. Sumner
County currently does not provide solid waste collection services. Residents that live outside the City in
the County must either contract for collection by a private hauler or take their solid waste to the Sumner
County Resource Authority. The City of Gallatin will begin collecting solid waste in the annexation area
based on the provisions set forth in Chapter 14 of the Gallatin Municipal Code.
Solid waste collection services are revenue neutral with revenue generated equaling expenses. Therefore,
no additional expenses beyond those that are generated by the fund will impact the City.
As is common with commercial and industrial businesses, trash collection will be handled by a contracted
service.
Wool Hawk Annexation Feasibility Study
Page 6 of 15
06/09/2020 Council Work Session Agenda-Page 18
Public Works - Street Construction and Repair
The Public Works Department provides street construction, resurfacing, and repair and maintenance
services throughout the City using in-house crews and contractors, depending on the specific scope of the
work. In addition, the Engineering Division and the Planning Department program long-range street
planning in coordination with the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) and the Nashville
Area Metropolitan Planning Organization.
With this annexation request, no existing rights-of-way are proposed to be annexed, and no new rights-of-
way are proposed to be built at this time. Future street construction will be negotiated by the developer
and the City.
Public Works - Vehicle Maintenance
The Public Works Department provides vehicle maintenance for all city vehicles and is budgeted at
$658,310 (City of Gallatin, 2019). This represents a cost of $16.46 per person. Depending on the growth
rate of the city, additional Public Works service vehicles and new positions may be required to service the
city including the annexed area. This was not figured into the analysis.
With this annexation request, no existing rights-of-way are proposed to be annexed, and no new
roadways/streets or new public drainage systems are proposed to be built at this time.
This analysis addresses the potential need for two (2) additional police vehicles to patrol in the proposed
annexation area. This would add to the current fleet of city vehicles.
Street Liehtine
Street lighting is managed and maintained by the Gallatin Department of Electricity. Street lights provide
lighting for safe use of the streets at night, particularly at intersections. While some benefit is received by
abutting properties, the street lighting program is not designed to provide security lighting. Street lighting
can be extended into the annexation area along with the extension of the electric facilities. Street lighting
is normally installed with the occupancy of buildings in a developed area. The Gallatin Electric
Department (GED) is now installing the newer, high-efficiency LED street lights in the City.
With this annexation request, no existing rights-of-way are proposed to be annexed, and no new rights-of-
way are proposed to be built at this time. Any new public roadways would require street lighting.
Planning and Zoning Services
The City of Gallatin Planning Department provides planning and zoning services throughout the City
and within the Planning Region. The Planning Department works with property owners and developers
to determine the most appropriate zoning and uses for their property consistent with the City's Gallatin
on the Move 2020 General Development Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. The Municipal/Regional
Planning Commission is responsible for reviewing and recommending rezoning requests and approving
development proposals. The City Council is responsible for approving rezoning requests. The Planning
Department also investigates and resolves zoning complaints and violations. The Sumner County
Planning and Codes Department is responsible for planning and zoning services in the areas located in
the UGB, outside of the City of Gallatin's Planning Region. As the City continues to develop, additional
planning staff will be necessary to provide the same level of service to the community.

The annexation area can be served by existing Planning Department resources without significant costs
to property owners or to others in the City.
Buildine and Codes Administration
The Building Codes Department is responsible for reviewing building plans and issuing residential and
non-residential building permits and providing the necessary inspections to ensure compliance with
adopted city codes throughout the City and within the Planning Region. However, the City does not
enforce municipal building code violations outside of the city limits. In addition, Sumner County is
responsible for enforcing nuisance complaints outside of the city limits, regardless of whether the
property is located within the Planning Region and/or UGB.
The annexation area can be served by existing Building Department resources without significant costs
to property owners or to others in the City.
Police Services
The City of Gallatin Police Department provides enforcement and safety education services within the
corporate limits of the City of Gallatin with a strong focus on domestic violence interventiono traffic
safety, and community outreach programs. A2016 Annual Report by the Gallatin Police Department
indicates the department has 1 l4 total staff, includingT0 sworn officers, 26 civilian staff, and l8 reserve
officers (Gallatin Police Department,2016). The Sumner County Sheriff s Department has 100 deputies
to service the entire County with a projected population in 2018 of 185,950 (Boyd Center for Business
and Economic Research,2019). The City of Gallatin has mutual aid agreements with surrounding
jurisdictions to provide/receive additional support when needed. Additionally, joint task forces have
been established, including the Emergency Response Team, the Drug Task Force, DUI checkpoints,
criminal investigations, and criminal prosecutions.
Several growth related factors influence crime control and prevention service effectiveness, including:
o the level of service based on a 2.55 police officers per 1,000 population ratio,
o the extent of the geographic service area,
o the culture/nature of crimes, and
o population density and concentration.
Ln2007, the Municipal TechnicalAdvisory Services recommended that the City maintain an officer to
population rutio of 2.55 police officers per 1,000 citizens. The national average is 2.4 officers per 1,000.
The current support personnel ratio is slightly more than 1.0 per 1,000 citizens. A similar ratio must be
maintained to provide the same levelof service as the city grows.
As this annexation is for an industrial use, the level of service and cost standard is not traditionally
evaluated based on non-residential use. The Police Department indicated that additional police officers
and departmental vehicles would be needed to provide service to this area.
An increase of approximately 524 acres within city limits would result in a2.5Yo increase in land to be
patrolled by the City of Gallatin Police Department. With 70 swom officers on staff, the Police
Wool Hawk Annexation Feasibility Study
Page 8 of 15
06/09/2020 Council Work Session Agenda-Page 20
Department could potentially expect to need two (2) additional officers to service the annexation area. The
Gallatin Police Department also assigns each officer his/her own vehicle. The total cost for a fully
equipped patrol vehicle is $50,485 using current City budget estimates.
For purposes of this study, police level of service was estimated based on the current year budget of
$9,338,539.

Fire Protection Services
The City of Gallatin Fire Department (GFD) provides full-time fire protection service to all City residents.
The GFD currently has 98 full-time employees, including 90 firefighters, engineers, and officers. Based
on this staffing level, the city provides one firefighter per 444 persons.
As this annexation is for an industrial use, the level of service and cost standard is not traditionally
evaluated based on non-residential use. The Fire Department indicated that this annexation will place
additional strain on Fire Station #l and the system altogether. Due to the sites and the location and
distance from primary and secondary response fire stations, the size of the project, as well as the
extended emergency apparatus travel/response times required for on-scene arrival, the Fire Department
recommends that an additional fire station with the proper number of assigned firefighters and necessary
equipment be provided in the eastern side of town. The additional station is needed to serve other
properties in the area and is not solely dependent upon the annexed territory to justify the need for a
station.
The future Fire Station #6 on Commerce Way will likely become a more pressing need as the eastern
side of town continues to develop.
An increase of approximately 524 acres within city limits would result in a2.5Yo increase in land areato
be served by the City of Gallatin Fire Department. With 90 firefighters on staff, the Fire Department could
potentially expect to need three (3) additional firefighters to service the annexation area.
For purposes of this study, fire level of service was estimated based on the current year budget of
s7,692.130.

Stormwater
The City of Gallatin is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), Phase II, to manage stormwater discharges
(Enviromental Protection Agency, 2019). In July of 2018, the City adopted an ordinance creating a
Stormwater Utility and Fee program to provide an action plan and a revenue source for the City to meet
its MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer systems). As part of the ordinance, a monthly fee, based on
impervious coverage, less credits, is billed through the appropriate utility provider (GPU or WHUD).
The fee for non-residential development is based on the equivalent residential unit (ERU) or SFU
(Single-Family Unit). Per the City of Gallatin Stormwater website:
"To determine the monthlyfee, divide the total impervious areaof the property by 3,650 square
feet (or one Single Family Unit) to obtain the number of SFUs and multiply by the base single
.family rate (85.00 per month per SFU)."
The Stormwater fund is revenue neutral with revenue generated equaling expenses. Therefore, no
additional expenses beyond those that are generated by the fund will impact the City.
PROJECT REVENUES AND COST FEASIBILITY
Upon adoption of a Plan of Services resolution and annexation resolution, the city shall provide the
documents to the Emergency Management Communications Center per Section 6-51-119, Tenn. Code
Annotated. In addition, per Section 6-51-115, Tenn. Code Annotated, the City shall provide information
to the state pertaining to all sales and use taxes. Since the property is substantially undeveloped, no sales
or use tax revenues from these sources are generated from the property. However, property taxes are
generated each year. The current property tax revenues are identified in Table 3 below. Some parcels
(Tax Map I12, Parcel 013.02) included in the annexation are classified as a greenbelt (GB) property by
Sumner County Register of Deeds. All other tax revenue is allocated to Sumner County.

PROPERTY VALUATION
Industrial (Commercial) properties are assessed at 40 percent of appraised value. The City of Gallatin's
current tax rate is $0.80 per $100 of assessed value and Sumner County's current tax rate is $2.26 per
$100 of assessed value. Property owners located within the City of Gallatin pay a combined property tax
rate (City and County) of $3.06 per $100 of assessed value.

Table 4 compares the tax liability for a 100 acre industrial development (Beretta) valued at$12,554,700
located in the City of Gallatin with the proposed development type if located inside the City. The projected
total property tax obligation for an industrial building valued at $12,554,700 with applicable adjustments
would be $113,494 in the county and $40,175 within the city.

The assumed value of any future industrial development is expected to compare with other industrial
developments in the Gallatin Industrial Center such as Beretta, which was recently constructed along
Gateway Drive. However, the proposed 524 acre annexation is 5.25 times the size of the Beretta property.
Taking this aspect into account, the total tax obligation upon development is conservatively projected as
follows:
Table 5. Example for Industrial Development in Annexation Area of 524 Acres

= $65,912,175 x .40 =$26,364,870 x .80/100 =

Total Property Tax Projection
870 x2.261100 = 
$595,846
$ 806,765
Upon development of the property, approximately $806,765 in property tax revenue would be generated
including $210,919 in yearly property tax revenue to the city.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed annexation for 524.14 acres is a unique request from a cost-benefit analysis perspective
due to the amount of information that is not known but also is not required at the time of annexation.
Annexing and rezoning the subject properties to an industrial zoning will substantially increase the value
(S1,016,853 as residentially/agriculturally zoned and vacant land to 565,912,175 as industrially zoned
and developed land) and will increase the associated property taxes ($9,192 in the county to potentially
$806,765 when fully developed within city limits). City services such as utilities, fire and police
services, and administrative and permit costs cannot be fully evaluated since there is no specific
development tied to the annexation request. Potential revenue and expenditures will be dependent upon
the future development of this site.
Outside of the scope of this study, a site plan for Wool Hawk has been submitted to the Gallatin
Planning Department for review by the Planning Commission should the City Council approve the plan
of service, annexation, and rezoning requests. Additionallyo two resolutions were approved by the City
Council at the May l gth Council meeting. Resolution No. R2OO5 -24 approved a Payment in Lieu of Tax
(PILOT) Program Economic Development lncentive for Project Wool Hawk. Resolution No. R2OO5-27
authorized the Mayor to sign a Development Agreement with Woo[ Hawk LLC. These actions have a
direct impact on the future revenues and expenditures to be associated with development of the subject
property.
This annexation study and preliminary plan of service was prepared after receiving the petition of
annexation for presentation to the City Council. The Plan of Service and Annexation Resolutions will be
Wool Hawk Annexation Feasibility Study

considered after public hearings are held on these items. The City of Gallatin is prepared to provide for
the future growth and development that is expected to occur on the properties over an extended period
needed to fully develop the properties. [f annexation is not pursued in a timely manner, the City's ability
to successfully manage growth will be negatively impacted.

(ANNX-2020-0006) pursuant to Tenn. Code Annotated $ 6-51-102(b)
A. Potable Water
The Gallatin Public Utilities and Industrial Pre-Treatment Departments indicated that there is
sufficient water infrastructure in this area to support the proposed annexation, although not all
properties in the proposed annexation area currently have this service available. The developer will
be responsible for all costs associated with the infrastructure improvements necessary to support
the annexation and development of these properties.
B. Sanitary Sewer
The Gallatin Public Utilities and Industrial Pre-Treatment Departments indicated that there is
sufficient sanitary sewer infrastructure in this area to support the proposed annexation, although
not all properties in the proposed annexation area curently have this service available. The
developer will be responsible for all costs associated with the infrastructure improvements
necessary to support the annexation and development of these properties.
C. Street Construction and Maintenance
No new public right-of-way is proposed to be annexed with this request. Any new roadways and
future maintenance needs will be dependent upon subsequent development and shall be evaluated
with future site plans and subdivision plats.
D. Solid Waste and Refuse Collection
Upon annexation, the City of Gallatin willbegin collecting solid waste in the annexation area
based on the provisions set forth in the Gallatin Municipal Code. Industry and business will have
access to city operated resource recovery programs and services. Depending on specific users,
some or all sanitary waste collection services may be contracted to private service
providers/operators.
E. Planning and Zoning Services
Upon annexation, planning and zoning services, including zoning enforcement, will be provided
by the City of Gallatin.
F. Building Inspections and Code Bnforcement Services
Upon annexation, building and code inspection services will be provided by the City of Gallatin
G. Fire Protection
The Fire Department indicated that this annexation will place additional strain on Fire Station # I
and the system altogether. Due to the project's (Wool Hawk's) location and distance from
primary and secondary response fire stations, the size of the project, as well as the extended
emergency apparatus travel/response times required for on-scene arrival, the Fire Department
recommends that an additional fire station with the proper number of assigned firefighters and
necessary equipment be provided in the eastern side of town.
The Fire Department recommended that Fire Station #6 be considered as a part of this project.
The location of the station will be on Commerce Drive (ll2l1016.00) approximately 2.1 miles
Wool Hawk Annexation Feasibility Study
Page 13 of 15
06/09/2020 Council Work Session Agenda-Page 25
from the majority of the property and will require an average response time of five (5) minutes.
As the annexed area is developed, fire protection will be evaluated to determine the sufficient
levels of service. The City will begin the process of planning and construction of the fire station
to serve the area.
H. Police Protection
After the effective date of the annexation, the Gallatin Police Department will provide police
patrol, response to calls, and other routine police services to the properties. The Police Department
indicated that additional police officers and departmental vehicles will be needed to provide service
to this area.
I. Animal Control
The Gallatin Police Department provides animal control services and enforces the City's animal
control ordinances. After the effective date of the annexation, these services will be available in
the annexation area.
J. Recreational Facilities and Programs
After the effective date of the annexation, the benefit and use of all recreational facilities and
programs provided by the Leisure Services Department will be available. Recreational facilities
and programs will be provided with existing personnel, facilities, and resources. However, the City
does not anticipate any residential development on the property so the need for additional
recreation resources to maintain suitable Levels of Service is not anticipated.
K. Street Lighting and Electric Service
Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation currently services this area outside of Gallatin city
limits. The Gallatin Department of Electricity indicated that additional electrical infrastructure
would be necessary to provide service to this area. The department also indicated that GDE would
provide temporary power while TVA would provide permanent power.
L. Gas
The Gallatin Public Utilities Department provides natural gas services to residential, business, and
industrial customers in the City of Gallatin and outside the City's corporate limits. The Gallatin
Public Utilities and Industrial Pre-Treatment Departments indicated that, upon extension of service
lines, there is sufficient natural gas infrastructure in this area to support the proposed annexation,
although not all properties in the proposed annexation currently have this service available. The
developer will be responsible for all costs associated with the gas utility infrastructure
improvements necessary to support the annexation and development of these properties.
M. School System
The City provided written notice to the Sumner County School System of the proposed annexation
and rezoning prior to the public hearing on the annexation resolution as required by Tenn. Code
Annotated, Section 6- 5 I - I 02(b)(2).

RE: Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) Modification Request
Mr. Free/Mr, McCord:
We humbly ask as a contiguous property owner that the City of Hendersonville contract their
UGB to the west side of the Big Station Camp Blvd. right-of-way and the City of Gallatin expand
their UGB to the same point per TCA 6-58-118. See Exhibit A to this letter showing the
requested area to be modified outlined in blue. SC Partners owns the adjacent land shown in
dark brown which is already a part of the City of Gallatin. Further, it is our understanding that
Hendersonville has already de-annexed the subject property to help facilitate this request.
Our request is that both cities pass resolutions to honor this request by July 8,2O2O if possible
so that it may be heard and acted upon at the next LGPAC Board meeting on July 22,2O2O.
please let us know if you require anything further form us to process this request.
Sincerely,
SC Partners, Landowner

please let us know if you're willing and able to pursue the route proposed in the email below with Hendersonville. This
seems to be an effective shortcut to relocate the UGB to allow for the rest of Westfield to be eventually annexed into
Gallatin. please let us know when you'd like to discuss as it appears to be time sensitive with the state. Thank you.

We have received this request from Southeastern to use a provision of TCA to amend the UBG for them as a contiguous
property owner for the 10 acre property orr Big Station Camp, which would have to be approved by LGPAC in the State
ECD office (similar to approval a normal coordinating committee change in the urban growth boundary).
I have written a resolution that should be sufficient for LGPAC to consider. I have spoken with Logan McCoy who is the
staff liaison there, and their next deadline is July 8th for the July 22nd LGPAC meeting. lt would allow for a simultaneous
UBG swap of the property and right-of-way lf approved by LGPAC, and then allow Gallatin to begin the annexation
process. This is the only avenue I am aware of, aside from the full coordinating committee to meet that could work for
this specific situation, and I am very doubtful that can be approved by every city by July 8th.
The next opportunity to amend the UBG will be sometime in the fall, as they meet quarterly. I understand thls will cause
a significant delay for Southeastern.
We have no specific requirement for this to get a recommendation for this by our Planning Commission. We can submit
this to the appropriate committee and Board in June and submit it to LGPAC, and Gallatin may do the same if they
wish. I am copying Bill and Mayor Brown, you all are welcome to copy the language of the resolution if you wish to
proceed with it. We will be glad to assist Gallatin and their staff in getting the information to LGPAC if it is approved.
Thank you,
Grant

Newman's Crossing - Traffic lmpact
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Project Description
The Newman's Crossing development is located on the southwest corner of the
intersection of Big Station Camp Boulevard and Long Hollow Pike in Gallatin,
Tennessee. According to the developer, the proposed development is planned to
consist of approximately 100 townhome units, 14,400 square feet of general retail
space, 3,000 square feet of quick-service restaurant space with drive-thru, 48,400
square feet of space for a grocery store, and a 4,000 square-foot convenience store
with 16 fueling positions. The purpose of this study is to analyze the access plan and
the traffic impacts associated with the proposed development.
Data Collection
ln order to provide data for the traffic impact analysis, traffic counts were conducted
at the intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp Boulevard/Carellton
Drive by KCI Technologies, lnc. Specifically, the counts were conducted from 7:00 -
9:00 AM and 4:00 - 6:00 PM on a typical weekday in August 2018 while local schools
were in session. From the counts, it was determined that the peak hours of traffic flow
occurred from 7:00 - 8:00 AM and 4:00 - 5:00 PM.
Projection of Future Traffic Volumes
ln order to account for the traffic growth prior to the completion of the proposed
project, background traffic volumes were established, which include a background
growth rate to account for general traffic arowth within the study area based on TDOT
count station data and the traffic Aenerated by developments being built in the vicinity
of the project site. Then the estimated project-generated traffic volumes were added
to the background peak hour traffic volumes in order to obtain the total projected
peak hour traffic volumes for the study area intersections.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The analyses presented in this study indicate that the impacts of the proposed project
on the existing street network will be manageable by providing the recommendations
below. These specific recommendations will provide safe and efficient traffic
operations within the study area following the completion of the proposed project.
The recommendations are as follows:

Newman's Crossing - Troffic
The following improvements for the intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big Station
Camp Boulevard/Carellton Drive were adopted from the Big Station Camp Boulevard
corridor study prepared for the City of Gallatin:
lnstall an exclusive left-turn lane with approximately 300 feet of storage on the
northbound approach of Big Station Camp Boulevard.
Extend the eastbound right-turn lane on Long Hollow Pike to provide a total of
280 feet of storage. The Big Station Camp Boulevard corridor study prepared
for the City of Gallatin recommended that the eastbound right-turn lane on
Long Hollow Pike be extended to provide a total of 300 feet of storage.
However, a 300-foot long storage length would require the relocation of
proposed Site Access 2 farther to the west, which would lead to sight distance
limitations for vehicles turning left out of this proposed site access. ln order to
ensure adequate sight distance for Site Access 2 as designated in the current
site plan, the storage for the eastbound right-turn lane of Long Hollow Pike at
Big Station Camp Boulevard should be increased from 145 feet to 280 feet as
opposed to 3OO feet. According to the evaluation of the 95th percentile queue
lengths for the intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp
Boulevard under projected conditions with improvements, providing 280 feet
of storage for the eastbound right-turn lane of Long Hollow Pike will be more
than sufficient to accommodate traffic demand during both the AM and PM
peak hours.
Restripe the southbound approach of Carellton Drive to include one left-turn
lane and one shared through/right-turn lane.
Modify the traffic signal to provide protected-permissive left-turn signal
phasing for all approaches. Also, provide a right-turn overlap phase for the
eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike.
The following improvements should be provided in conjunction with the development
of this project:
Lonq
. Due to the potential for pedestrian activity between the retail portion of the
proposed development and the Carellton development to the north, it is
recommended to provide a pedestrian crosswalk and pedestrian signals with
countdown timers for movements across the west leg of Long Hollow Pike.

Lono Hollow Pike and Site Access 1 (Western Access)
. The proposed connection to Long Hollow Pike should be designed as a right-
in, right-out access with one entering lane and one exiting lane. A stop bar and
R1-1 'Stop'sign should be installed on the egress approach.
. A channelized right-turn lane with approximately 120 feet of storage is planned
to be installed on the eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access
1.
. As part of the construction of the project, the driveway connection should be
designed such that the departure sight triangles, as specified by AASHTO, will
be clear of all sight obstructions, including landscaping, existing vegetation,
monument signs/walls, fences, etc.
o According to field measurements, adequate intersection sight distance
is available for turning right out of the proposed site access.
Lono Hollow Pike and Site Access 2 (Eastern Access)
. Based on the results of a left-turn lane analysis, a westbound left-turn lane on
Long Hollow Pike is warranted under projected conditions.
o lt should be noted that the speed limit on Long Hollow Pike is under
consideration to be lowered to 40 mph. The results of the analysis
indicate that a left-turn lane is warranted at the site access even with the
reduced speed limit.
. A right-turn lane with approximately 100 feet of storage is planned to be
installed on the eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2 and
a left-turn lane with approximately 190 feet of storage is planned to be installed
on the westbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2.

o According to field measurements, while adequate stopping sight
distance is available, adequate intersection sight distance is only
available for turning right out of the proposed site access. The available
sight distance for turning left out of the proposed site access falls 35 feet
below the design value. ln order to enhance the sight distance for
vehicles turning left out of Site Access 3, its location should either be
shifted or its grade should be raised until sight distance requirements
are met.

1. INTRODUCTION AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this study is to analyze the traffic impacts and access plan associated
with the proposed Newman's Crossing mixed-use development located on the
southwest corner of the intersection of Big Station Camp Boulevard and Long Hollow
Pike in Gallatin, Tennessee. According to information provided by the development
team, the site is planned to include approximately 100 townhome units, 14,400 square
feet of general retail space, 3,000 square feet of quick-service restaurant space with
drive-thru, 48,400 square feet of space for a grocery store, and a 4,000 square-foot
convenience store with 16 fueling positions.
As shown by Figure 1, the property is located on the southwest corner of Big Station
Camp Boulevard and Long Hollow Pike. The property is bounded on the north by Long
Hollow Pike, on the east by Big Station Camp Boulevard, and on the south and west
by existing residential properties. The proposed development is located within an area
that is characlerized primarily by a mix of low and medium-density residential land
uses. Five vehicular access points to the development are planned to be provided -
two to the north on Long Hollow Pike, two to the east on Big Station Camp Boulevard,
and one cross-parcel accesses to the south by way of Breaking Pen Road. The
westernmost site access on Long Hollow Pike is planned to be right-in, right-out. The
current site plan for the development is shown in Appendix A.
ln this study, the current operating characteristics of the adjacent roadways and
intersections near the project site are evaluated. The expected trips generated by the
proposed development are determined and distributed to the roadway network. The
adjacent roadways and intersections are then re-evaluated to determine the
anticipated traffic impacts of the project. Finally, recommendations are presented,
including roadway improvements and/or traffic control improvements that are needed
to accommodate the expected traffic.

2.2 Existing Traffic Volumes
ln order to provide data for the traffic impact analysis, traffic counts were conducted
at the intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp Boulevard/Carellton
Drive by KCI Technologies, lnc. Specifically, the counts were conducted from 7:00 -
9:00 AM and 4:00 - 6:00 PM on a typical weekday in August 2018 while local schools
were in session. From the counts, it was determined that the peak hours of traffic flow
occurred from 7:00 - 8:00 AM and 4:00 - 5:00 PM. Traffic volumes associated with
Starting Gate Drive were estimated based on the number of homes. Existing traffic
peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 3. A detailed summary of the turning
movement counts is included in Appendix B.
Average daily traffic volumes were also obtained from the Tennessee Department of
Transportation (TDOT). There are two TDOT count stations located near the project
site. The count station locations and annual average daily traffic (AADI) in 2017 are
shown in Table 1. TDOI Count Station data is included in Appendix C.

2.3 Existin g T ratlic Operations
To determine the current operation of the study intersections, capacity analyses were
performed for the AM and PM peak hours. The capacity calculations were performed
according to the methods outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual, TRB 2010. The
capacity analyses result in the determination of a Level of Service (LOS) for an
intersection. The LOS is a concept used to describe how well an intersection or
roadway operates. LOS A is the best, while LOS F is the worst. Table 2 presents the
descriptions of LOS for unsignalized intersections. Table 3 presents the descriptions of
LOS for signalized intersections.

3. BACKGROUND TRAFFIC VOLUMES
3.1 Establishing Background Volumes
ln order to account for the traffic growth prior to the completion of the proposed
project, background traffic volumes were established. For the purposes of this traffic
study, the development was assumed to be completed by the year 2022, which is a
four-year horizon from 2018 existing traffic counts. The background traffic included
general traffic growth in the study area as well as site-specific traffic expected to be
generated by a future development in the surrounding area. Historical daily traffic
volumes were obtained from the TDOT count stations located near the project site.
Since 2011, the traffic at the TDOT count stations has increased by an average of 3.86o/"
per year. The TDOT count station data is included in Appendix C.
A growth factor was applied to the existing peak hour traffic volumes to account for
background growth for the future conditions. The existing peak hour traffic volumes
at the study intersections were increased by 1.5o/o per year to account for the
background traffic Arowth within the study area. The chosen growth factor is lower
than the average growth factor recorded by TDOT count stations because the trips
generated by two developments near the study area were accounted for separately,
as explained below.
The Carellton development is under construction north of the intersection of Long
Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp Boulevard. The development is anticipated to
include approximately 4BO single-family homes, 239 townhome units, and 7,000
square feet of retail space. Based on information from the City of Gallatin, it is
estimated that the residential portion of the development is approximately 40%
complete. A traffic aeneration process was used to estimate the amount of traffic
expected to be generated by the completed Carellton development. Factors for the
trip generation were taken from ITE's Trip Generation,lOt^ Edition. The calculations for
trip generation are included in Appendix F. Table 5 presents the daily, AM, and PM
peak hour trip generation for the Carellton development. As shown, the pending
development can be expected to generate approximately 3,965 new trips per day. The
AM and PM peak hour trips generated will equal approximately 280 and 428 new trips,
respectively.

A new school campus is also proposed to be developed on Upper Station Camp Creek
Road. The campus is expected to include an elementary school with a capacity of 800
children, a middle school with a capacity of 1,200 children, and a high school with a
capacity of 1,800 children. At full capacity, the school campus is expected to generate
approximalely 7,722 new trips per day. The AM and PM peak hour trips generated will
equal approximately 2,168 and 1,286 new trips, respectively. The traffic assignment for
both background developments is included in Appendix F.
The combined background peak hour traffic volumes for the year 2022 are presented
in Figure 4. These volumes represent the peak hour traffic that is expected to be on
the roadway even if the proposed development is not completed.

3.2 Background Traffic Operations
To determine the operation of the study area intersections under background
conditions, capacity analyses were performed for the AM and PM peak hours. The
analyses for the background conditions were based on the same lane configurations
as the existing conditions.
As shown in Tables 64 and 68, under background conditions the capacity analyses
indicate that the operations at the study intersections will operate at LOS D or better
in the AM and PM peak hours with one exception. The intersection of Long Hollow
Pike and Big Station Camp Boulevard drops from LOS C to LOS E in both the AM and
PM peak hours. Capacity analyses worksheets are included in Appendix E.

4. IMPACTS
4.1Trip Generation
A traffic generation process was used to estimate the amount of traffic expected to be
generated by the proposed Newman's Crossing mixed-use development. As
previously discussed, the site is planned to include approximately 100 townhome units,
14,400 square feet of general retail space, 3,000 square feet of quick-service restaurant
space with drive-thru, 48,400 square feet of space for a grocery store, and a 4,000
square-foot convenience store with 16 fueling positions. Factors for the trip generation
were taken from ITE's Trip Generation,lOt^ Edition.
Data presented in the ITE publication, Trip Generation Handbook, show that
developments containing multiple land uses will commonly have internal trips. A
process was used to estimate the amount of internal trips that can be expected
between land uses based on methodology presented in NCHRP Report 684,
"Enhancing lnternal Trip Capture Estimation for Mixed-Use Developments." The
methodology contained in the NCHRP Report expands on ITE's methodology,
including additional land uses and supporting data. The internaltrip reduction process
resulted in an estimaled 10o/o internal capture rate for the AM peak hour, and a 31o/o
internal capture rate for the PM peak hour. For the daily trip generation , a 20o/o internal
capture rate was applied. lnternal capture reductions were applied to all land uses. The
calculations for trip generation are included in Appendix G.
ln addition to internal trips, pass-by trips were also taken into account. Pass-by trips
represent vehicles already on the existing network that stop at the development and
later continue on to their primary destination with no route diversions. Pass-by trip
percentages were taken from ITE's Trip Generation Handbook, Second Edition. For the
AM peak hour, a 55% pass-by rate was applied to trips generated by land uses within
lhe Services category. For the PM peak hour, a 45o/o pass-by rate was applied to trips
generated by land uses within lhe Services and Retail categories. For the daily traffic, a
pass-by trip percentage of 50% was used for trips generated by all non-residential land
uses. The directional distribution and assignment of pass-by trips in shown in Appendix
H.
Table 7 presents the daily, AM, and PM peak hour trip generation for the proposed
land uses. As shown, the development can be expected to generate approximately
4,737 new trips per day. The AM and PM peak hour trips generated will equal
approximately 350 and 372 new trips, respectively. These trips represent the new traffic
that will be generated by the proposed development.

4.2Trip Distribution and Traffic Assignment
A directional distribution of traffic generated by the proposed project was established
based on the proposed accesses, existing roadway network, and the existing travel
patterns developed from the existing peak hour traffic counts. As previously discussed,
five vehicular access points to the development are planned to be provided - two to
the north on Long Hollow Pike, two to the east on Big Station Camp Boulevard, and
one cross-parcel accesses to the south by way of Breaking Pen Road. The westernmost
site access on Long Hollow Pike is planned to be right-in, right-out. Additionally, as
new developments are built to the west of the project site, one future cross-parcel
access to the west is planned to be provided.
The directional distribution for the proposed development is shown in Figure 5. As
shown in the figure, approximately 41"/o of the traffic generated by the development
will be oriented to the south on Big Station Camp Boulevard, 35o/olo the east on Long
Hollow Pike,lo/o to the north on Carellton Drive, and 23o/" to the west on Long Hollow
Pike. Based on this directional distribution, the project-generated traffic was assigned
to the roadway network. The traffic assignment for the proposed development is
shown in Figure 6.

4.3 Capacity / Level of Service Analyses
The total site-generated traffic volumes were added to the background peak hour
traffic volumes for the proposed development in order to obtain the total projected
traffic volumes for the study intersections. Figure 7 presents the total projected AM
and PM peak hour traffic volumes expected at the completion of the proposed
development.
Capacity analyses were performed in order to determine the impact of the project on
the study intersections. These capacity analyses were also used to evaluate the need
for roadway and traffic control improvements at the intersections studied. The capacity
calculations were performed according to the methods outlined in the Highway
Capaclty Manual, TRB 2010. The results of the capacity analyses for the projected
conditions at the study area intersections are presented in Tables 8A and BB. For the
analyses, the intersection configurations were the same as the background conditions,
with the following exceptions, as per the provided site plan:
. A channelized right-turn lane with approximalely 120 feet of storage was
assumed to be provided for the eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at
Site Access 1.
. A right-turn lane with approximately 100 feet of storage was assumed to be
provided for the eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2.
. A left-turn lane with approximately 190 feet of storage was assumed to be
provided for the westbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2.
o A right-turn lane with approximately 120 feet of storage was assumed to be
provided for the southbound approach of Big Station Camp Boulevard at Site
Access 3.
All site access drives were treated as stop-controlled. Site Access 1, Site Access 2, and
Site Access 3 were modeled to include one entering lane and two exiting lanes; one
right-turn lane and one left-turn lane. Site Access 4 and Site Access 5 were modeled
to include one entering lane and one shared left-turn/right-turn exiting lane.
As shown in Tables BA and BB, under the projected conditions the capacity analyses
indicate that the study intersections are expected to generally operate at the same
levels of service as under the background conditions, with one exception; the
intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp Boulevard is expected to drop
from LOS E to LOS F in the AM peak hour. Additionally, all critical turning movements
at the proposed site accesses are expected to operate at LOS C or better with the
following exceptions:

Newman's Crossing - Traffic
2019
The northbound left-turn approach of Site Access 2 at Long Hollow Pike is
expected to operate at LOS F in the AM and PM peak hours.
The eastbound left-turn approach of Site Access 3 at Big Station Camp
Boulevard is expected to operate at LOS E in the AM and PM peak hours.
It should be noted that these performances are common for stop-controlled
approaches to high volume roadways such as Long Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp
Boulevard.
Based on the capacity analyses results forthe intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big
Station Camp Boulevard, additional analyses were conducted to evaluate potential
improvement options. lt should be noted that these improvements are warranted
primarily by the traffic volumes generated by the previously discussed background
developments. The improvements described in detail below were adopted from the
Big Station Camp Boulevard corridor study prepared for the City of Gallatin.
. lnstall an exclusive left-turn lane with approximately 300 feet of storage on the
northbound approach of Big Station Camp Boulevard.
. Extend the eastbound right-turn lane on Long Hollow Pike to provide a total of
280 feet of storage. The Big Station Camp Boulevard corridor study prepared
for the City of Gallatin recommended that the eastbound right-turn lane on
Long Hollow Pike be extended to provide a total of 300 feet of storage.
However, a 300-foot long storage length would require the relocation of
proposed Site Access 2 farlher to the west, which would lead to sight distance
limitations for vehicles turning left out of this proposed site access. ln order to
ensure adequate sight distance for Site Access 2 as designated in the current
site plan, the storage for the eastbound right-turn lane of Long Hollow Pike at
Big Station Camp Boulevard should be increased from 145 feet to 280 feet as
opposed to 300 feet.
. Restripe the southbound approach of Carellton Drive to include one left-turn
lane and one shared through/right-turn lane.
. Modify the traffic signal to provide protected-permissive left-turn signal
phasing for all approaches. Also provided a right-turn overlap phase for the
eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike.
The results of the capacity analyses for the improved intersections are presented in
Tables 8A and 88 in bold. As shown, the intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big
Station Camp Boulevard/Carellton Drive improves to LOS D in both the AM and PM
peak hours. Capacity analyses worksheets are included in Appendix E.

5. ANALYSIS OF SITE PLAN
5.1 Site Access Review
According to information provided by the development team, the development is
planned to consist of approximately 100 townhome units, 14,400 square feet of general
retail space, 3,000 square feet of quick-service restaurant space with drive-thru, 48,400
square feet of space for a grocery store, and a 4,000 square-foot convenience store
with '16 fueling positions. Five vehicular access points to the development are planned
to be provided - two to the north on Long Hollow Pike, two to the east on Big Station
Camp Boulevard, and one cross-parcel accesses to the south by way of Breaking Pen
Road. Additionally, as new developments are built to the west of the project site, one
future cross-parcel access to the west is planned to be provided. A description of each
proposed access follows:
. Site Access 1 is planned to be right-in, right-out. Additionally, a channelized
right-turn lane with approximately 120 feet of storage is planned to be installed
on the eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 1.
. Site Access 2 is planned to include one entering lane and two exiting lanes; one
right-turn lane and one left-turn lane. Additionally, a right-turn lane with
approximately 100 feet of storage is planned to be installed on the eastbound
approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2 and a left-turn lane with
approximately 190 feet of storage is planned to be installed on the westbound
approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2.
. Site Access 3 is planned to include one entering lane and two existing lanes;
one right-turn lane and one left-turn lane. Additionally, a right-turn lane with
approximately 120 feet of storage is planned to be installed on the southbound
approach of Big Station Camp Boulevard at Site Access 3.
o Site Access 4 and Site Access 5, which are intended for the exclusive use of
residents of the development, are planned to include one entering lane and
one exiting lane.
5.2 Sight Distance Analyses
Sight distance measurements were conducted at the proposed site accesses to
determine if adequate sight distance would be available for motorists making left or
right turns from the proposed site accesses. For 50 mph, the speed limit on Long
Hollow Pike, the guidelines from A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,
by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO),
call for a minimum stopping sight distance of 425 feet as a design value. This is the
distance required for a motorist to detect an object in the roadway necessitating a stop

and be able to stop before reaching the object. For 45 mph, the speed limit on Big
Station Camp Boulevard, a minimum stopping sight distance of 360 feet is called for
as a design value.
Subsequently, AASHTO also provides minimum design values for intersection sight
distance. For example, for a speed of 50 miles per hour, the design value for the
intersection sight distance for a motorist turning right from a stop is 480 feet.
Therefore, it is desirable to provide a minimum of 480 feet of sight distance looking
west from the proposed site accesses turning onto Long Hollow Pike. For a speed of
50 miles per hour, the design value for the intersection sight distance for a motorist
turning left from a stop is 555 feet. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a minimum of
555 feet of sight distance looking east from the site accesses turning onto Long Hollow
Pike.
Additionally, for a speed of 45 miles per hour, the design value for the intersection
sight distance for a motorist turning right from a stop is 430 feet. Therefore, it is
desirable to provide a minimum of 430 feet of sight distance looking north from the
proposed site accesses turning onto Big Station Camp Boulevard. For a speed of 45
miles per hour, the design value for the intersection sight distance for a motorist
turning left from a stop is 500 feet. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a minimum of
500 feet of sight distance looking south from the site accesses turning onto Big Station
Camp Boulevard.
Table 9 summarizes the results of the sight distance measurements at the proposed
sight accesses.

Adequate sight distance is available for turning right out of Site Access 1.
Approximately 500 feet of sight distance is available looking west, which exceeds the
design value of 480 feet for right turns.
Adequate sight distance is available for turning right and left out of Site Access 2. With
a sight distance of 450 feet looking east, a clear view of the intersection of Big Station
Camp Boulevard and Long Hollow Pike, approximately 350 feet away, is provided.
Approximately 500 feet of sight distance is available looking west, which exceeds the
design value of 480 feet for right turns.
Adequate sight distance is available for turning right out of Site Access 3. A clear view
is provided looking to the north of the intersection of Big Station Camp Boulevard and
Long Hollow Pike, approximalely 270 feet away. Due to the vertical curvature of Big
Station Camp Boulevard, the available intersection sight distance for turning left out
of the Site Access 3 does not meet design standards. Approximalely 465 feet of sight
distance is available looking south, which falls 35 feet below the design value of 500
feet for left turns. ln order to enhance the sight distance at this access, the location of
Site Access 3 can either be shifted or the driveway grade can be raised until the
required sight distance is met for left-turning vehicles exiting the development.
Adequate sight distance is available for turning right and left out of Site Access 4. Over
500 feet of sight distance is available looking south, which exceeds the design value of
500 feet for left turns. Approximately 465 feet of sight distance is available looking
north, which exceeds the design value of 430 feet for right turns.
5.3 Turn Lane Warrant Analysis
The westbound approach of Long Hollow Pike was evaluated for the need to provide
a left-turn lane at Site Access 2 based on the projected traffic volumes. This analysis
was based on the procedures outlined in M.D. Harmelink's Volume Warrants for Left-
Turn Storage Lanes at Unsignali.zed lntersections. The results on the analysis indicate
that a left-turn lane is warranted at Site Access 2 on Long Hollow Pike during the AM
and PM peak hours. lt should be noted that the speed limit on Long Hollow Pike is
under consideration to be lowered to 40 mph. The results on the analysis indicate that
a left-turn lane is warranted at Site Access 2 on Long Hollow Pike even with the reduced
speed limit. The left-turn lane analyses are included in Appendix l.
The northbound approach of the proposed Site Access 2 and the eastbound approach
of Site Access 3 were evaluated for the need to provide a two-lane approach based
on the projected traffic volumes during the AM and PM peak hours. According to

4-2, a two-lane approach is warranted forthe northbound approach of Site access 2,
but not for the eastbound approach of Site Access 3. Despite these results, a two-lane
approach should still be considered for both Site Access 2 and Site Access 3 in order
to improve the levels of service experienced by right-turning vehicles exiting the
development. The turn lane analyses are included in Appendix l.
5.4 Queue Analyses
ln addition to the capacity analyses at the study intersections, the 95th percentile queue
lengths during the AM and PM peak hours were evaluated for all study intersections.

5.5 TDOT Driveway Standards
TDOT permits access to state highways according to the standards outlined in their
Manualfor Constructing Driveway Entrances on State Highways,2015 Edition. The site
accesses on Long Hollow Pike (State Route 174) were evaluated according to these
standards.
According to Section 5.1.4, a two-way commercial driveway has a minimum width of
24feet and a maximum width of 40 feet. The maximum width is permitted to increase
to a maximum of 50 feet if the development is expected to serve a substantial volume
of heavy vehicles.
According to Section 5.1.5, access driveways must have a minimum of 150 feet of corner
clearance to an intersection of an arterial (Long Hollow Pike) and a collector (Big
Station Camp Boulevard). According to the developer's site plan, the distance between
Site Access 2 and the state Right-of-Way line is approximately 350 feet.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The analyses presented in this study indicate that the impacts of the proposed project
on the existing street network will be manageable by providing the recommendations
below. These specific recommendations will provide safe and efficient traffic
operations within the study area following the completion of the proposed project.
The recommendations are as follows:
The following improvements for the intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big Station
Camp Boulevard/Carellton Drive were adopted from the Big Station Camp Boulevard
corridor study prepared for the City of Gallatin:
lnstall an exclusive left-turn lane with approximately 300 feet of storage on the
northbound approach of Big Station Camp Boulevard.
Extend the eastbound right-turn lane on Long Hollow Pike to provide a total of
280 feet of storage. The Big Station Camp Boulevard corridor study prepared
for the City of Gallatin recommended that the eastbound right-turn lane on
Long Hollow Pike be extended to provide a total of 300 feet of storage.
However, a 300-foot long storage length would require the relocation of
proposed Site Access 2 farther to the west, which would lead to sight distance
limitations for vehicles turning left out of this proposed site access. ln order to
ensure adequate sight distance for Site Access 2 as designated in the current
site plan, the storage for the eastbound right-turn lane of Long Hollow Pike at
Big Station Camp Boulevard should be increased from 145 feet to 280 feet as
opposed to 3OO feet. According to the evaluation of the 95th percentile queue
lengths for the intersection of Long Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp
Boulevard under projected conditions with improvements, providing 280 feet
of storage for the eastbound right-turn lane of Long Hollow Pike will be more
than sufficient to accommodate traffic demand during both the AM and PM
peak hours.
Restripe the southbound approach of Carellton Drive to include one left-turn
lane and one shared through/right-turn lane.
Modify the traffic signal to provide protected-permissive left-turn signal
phasing for all approaches. Also, provide a right-turn overlap phase for the
eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike.

The following improvements should be provided in conjunction with the development
of this project:
Long Hollow Pike and Big Station Camp Boulevard/Carellton Drive
o Due to the potential for pedestrian activity between the retail portion of the
proposed development and the Carellton development to the north, it is
recommended to provide a pedestrian crosswalk and pedestrian signals with
countdown timers for movements across the west leg of Long Hollow Pike.
Long Hollow Pike and Site Access 1 (Western Access)
. The proposed connection to Long Hollow Pike should be designed as a right-
in, right-out access with one entering lane and one exiting lane. A stop bar and
R1-1 'Stop'sign should be installed on the egress approach.
. A channelized right-turn lane with approximately 120 feet of storage is planned
to be installed on the eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access
1.
. As part of the construction of the project, the driveway connection should be
designed such that the departure sight triangles, as specified by AASHTO, will
be clear of all sight obstructions, including landscaping, existing vegetation,
monument signs/walls, fences, etc.
o According to field measurements, adequate intersection sight distance
is available for turning right out of the proposed site access.
Lonq Hollow Pike and Site Access 2 (Eastern Access)
. Based on the results of a left-turn lane analysis, a westbound left-turn lane on
Long Hollow Pike is warranted under projected conditions.
o lt should be noted that the speed limit on Long Hollow Pike is under
consideration to be lowered to 40 mph. The results of the analysis
indicate that a left-turn lane is warranted at the site access even with the
reduced speed limit.
. A right-turn lane with approximately 100 feet of storage is planned to be
installed on the eastbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2 and
a left-turn lane with approximately 190 feet of storage is planned to be installed
on the westbound approach of Long Hollow Pike at Site Access 2.
. The proposed connection to Long Hollow Pike should be designed to include
one entering lane and two exiting lanes, one left-turn lane and one right-turn
lane. A stop bar and R1-1 'Stop'sign should be installed on the egress approach.
r As part of the construction of the project, the driveway connection should be
designed such that the departure sight triangles, as specified by AASHTO, will

be clear of all sight obstructions, including landscaping, existing vegetation,
monument signs/walls, fences, etc.
o According to field measurements, adequate intersection sight distance
is available for turning left and right out of the proposed site access.
Biq Station Camp Boulevard and Site Access 3 (Northern Access)
. The proposed connection of Site Access 3 to Big Station Camp Boulevard
should be designed to include sufficient width for one entering lane and two
exiting lanes, one left-turn lane and one right-turn lane. A stop bar and Rl-1
'Stop'sign should be installed on the egress approach.
. A right-turn lane with approximately 120 feet of storage is planned to be
installed on the southbound approach of Big Station Camp Boulevard at Site
Access 3.
. As part of the construction of the project, the driveway connection should be
designed such that the departure sight triangles, as specified by AASHTO, will
be clear of all sight obstructions, including landscaping, existing vegetation,
monument signs/walls, fences, etc.
o According to field measurements, while adequate stopping sight
distance is available, adequate intersection sight distance is only
available for turning right out of the proposed site access. The available
sight distance for turning left out of the proposed site access falls 35 feet
below the design value. ln order to enhance the sight distance for
vehicles turning left out of Site Access 3, its location should either be
shifted or its grade should be raised until sight distance requirements
are met.
Big Station Camp Boulevard and Site Access 4 (Southern Access Serving the Residential
Portion of the Site)
. The proposed connection of Site Access 4 to Big Station Camp Boulevard
should be designed to include sufficient width for one entering lane and one
exiting lane. A stop bar and R1-1 'Stop'sign should be installed on the egress
approach.
o As part of the construction of the project, the driveway connection should be
designed such that the departure sight triangles, as specified by AASHTO, will
be clear of all sight obstructions, including landscaping, existing vegetation,
monument signs/walls, fences, etc.
o According to field measurements, adequate intersection sight distance
is available for turning left and right out of the proposed site access.

Trip Generation and Big Station Camp Corridor Roadway Fees
. The Big Station Camp Corridor Roadway Fee program is based on the number
of peak hour trips generated by a development. Since the analyses presented
in this study are based on trip generation rates from a national dataset,
additional analysis may be performed after the completion and occupation of
each development phase to determine the actual peak hour trips generated, as
they may be less that those estimated in this study.
. Additionally, the construction of the recommendations presented above should
be considered against the City of Gallatin's impact fee program for this corridor.
ln some instances, constructed improvements that would need to be rebuilt in
the future may not best serve the adjacent roadway network.
ln summary, based on the analyses conducted, no further recommendations are
presented for the proposed development.
