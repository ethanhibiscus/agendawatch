4. STUDY SESSION 
a. Commercial Overlay District 
 
Allison presented an overview of the proposed Commercial Overlay District for the East Fourth Avenue, 
West Fifth Avenue/Nickerson Boulevard and parts of South Main Street.  After completion of the R-6 
Residential Infill District ordinance adoption, the Planning Commission asked staff to include 
consideration of an infill commercial district in the 2019 Planning Department Work Plan.  A 
subcommittee was formed and met to consider the target area and determine beneficial regulations. 
The objective was to study regulatory barriers to redevelopment of these areas and provide a 
recommendation of how to reduce or remove those barriers.   
 
The analysis included existing uses in comparison to the current zoning district, development of site and 
surrounding uses.  It was determined there are two separate categories regarding regulatory challenges 
for redevelopment within the target areas.  The properties were separated into two sub-districts as well 
as properties that are suitably zoned.  The proposed Commercial Overlay District, as well as the two sub-
districts, Traditional Urban Design and Mechanical Commercial, with proposed standards were included 
in the packet along with a proposed Commercial Overlay District map.  The committee determined an 
overlay district was the best option to proceed because it can adjust specific regulations without 
changing all regulations related to the development of the properties.   
 
Allison reviewed the proposed district standards for the two sub-districts in a powerpoint presentation.  
This included Traditional Urban Design Sub-District: Site Orientation/Design Standards, Mechanical 
Commercial Sub-District: Site Orientation/Design Standards, and General and Supplemental Design 
Standards.  Allison spoke on minimum lot standards, setbacks, parking and drive-thru requirements, 
                       PLANNING COMMISSION MINUTES

bicycle parking, building design, building materials, landscaping and screening, and signage 
requirements. 
 
Richardson asked about installation and maintenance of sidewalks.  Allison said it could be required to 
continue sidewalks if there are existing sidewalks in the neighborhood.  Roberts-Ropp said scooters may 
also need to be considered in parking areas. The consensus was bike racks could be incentivized and 
not required.  Removing unnecessary parking spaces is another option and using the area for outdoor 
seating rather than unused stalls.   
 
Allison reviewed the proposed Use Table.  The table was amended to add the two sub-districts and add 
“U” representing the Underlying Zoning District.  General and Supplemental Design Standards were 
reviewed, such as codifying specific requirements for building materials and design.  Potted plants and 
window boxes could be used to meet the 20% of lot landscaping. Signage would remain the same as 
downtown signage requirements in the Traditional Urban Design sub-district. 
 
(Roberts-Ropp left at 6:30 p.m.) 
 
If the Planning Commission directs staff to proceed with the proposed standards, property owners within 
the district will be contacted and an open-house meeting will be held.  Below is potential timeline: 
 
 
 
March 31, 2020 – Commercial Overlay District Open house

Commercial Overlay District, passed with the following vote:  Yes – Bisbee, Gamber, Leuenberger,

Public Hearing: June 9, 2020 
 
DATE: 
June 1, 2020 
 
TO: 
Hutchinson Planning Commission

Director of Planning & Development 
 
THROUGH: 
Jeff Cantrell 
City Manager 
SUBJECT: 
Public Hearing: ZA20-000001 – Zoning Ordinance Amendment: Research and Development Uses 
REQUEST: 
Request to amend Sections 27-406.C and 27-406.C.6 of the City of Hutchinson, KS Zoning Regulations. 
 
BACKGROUND: 
The proposed amendments in this request is based an examination of the ordinance and a review of previous 
developments that include a research and development component including Sensor Dynamix, located in the former 
Fire Station on E Avenue B, and Genzada Pharmaceuticals, located at the former Dillon’s site at Plum and 30th. These 
uses are both located in zoning districts that currently do not allow research and development uses, These “light” 
research and development uses, that are a mixture of research and development with office use were not 
contemplated by the ordinance. The proposed ordinance amendment would allow, with design requirements, these 
lighter uses in the C-4 (Special Commercial District) and C-5 (Downtown District) zoning districts. Similar design 
requirements that apply to research and development uses in the I-1 (Light Industrial District) and I-2 (Industrial 
District) are proposed for research and development uses in the C-4 and C-5 zoning districts. 
 
The proposed amendment was reviewed by the Development Review Committee on May 26, 2020; they had no 
comments. Finally, the proposed amendment was reviewed by the City Attorney, who also had no comments. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
Technology and information jobs are vital to a diverse economy in Hutchinson. According to Designing Our Future: 
Imagine Hutch 2037, in 2017 less than 3% of jobs available in Hutchinson were in the information category. Goal G.1.5.b 
of the Comprehensive Plan is attracting a wide variety of employers with a Performance Measure of an “increase in jobs… 
primarily in professional and technical services.” The current limitation of research and development uses permitted in only 
industrial districts, forwards the idea that research and development is limited to large industrial buildings, when in reality 
research and development is often done in offices that can be located in the downtown or along commercial corridors. Zoning 
theory in the last 10 to 20 years has shifted from regulating land use first, to embracing the idea of form-based code, which 
Staff Recommendation: 
Staff recommends approval of the proposed amendments to Sections 27-406.C and 27-406.C.6 of the Hutchinson 
Zoning Regulations amending the industrial use table, and the design requirements for a Research and 
Development use. 
 
Motion: 
Motion to recommend (approval / modification and approval / denial) to the City Council of Zoning Amendment 
request number ZA20-000001 for amendments to §27-406.C and §27-406.C.6 of the Hutchinson Zoning 
Regulations amending the industrial use table and the Research and Development Design Standards and Use 
Restrictions. 
regulates the building form first and the building use second. While Hutchinson, has more of a traditional zoning code, our 
design standards help to mitigate potential negative effects of a use in certain zoning districts, expanding the districts that a 
use might be permitted in. 
 
The proposed amendment expands research and development uses into the C-4 and C-5 zoning district. Furthermore, the 
proposed amendment places design standards on research and development uses. These design standards would hold 
research and development to similar design standards as other commercial uses in the C-4 and C-5 zoning districts by limiting 
outdoor storage of materials and prohibition of work with hazardous or explosive materials.  
 
NEXT STEPS: 
If the Planning Commission recommends approval of this request to the City Council, it will be considered on July 7, 
2020 for adoption.
