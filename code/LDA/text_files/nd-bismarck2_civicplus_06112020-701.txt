RENAISSANCE ZONE PROJECT – 418 EAST ROSSER AVENUE 
JJ HAGENESS RENOVATION, LLC – REHABILITATION 
 
Mr. Nairn gave an overview of the staff report and stated that the applicant, JJ Hageness 
Renovation, LLC, is requesting approval of a Rehabilitation Renaissance Zone project for use as 
office lease space at 418 East Rosser Avenue, otherwise known as the Professional Building.  
The applicant is proposing a project cost value of $2,500,000, exceeding the minimum 
investment threshold of 50% of the assessed building value and at least $40 per square foot of 
finished floor area in capital improvements.  Mr. Nairn stated that staff believes that replacement 
of the windows would be sufficient to eliminate any and all deteriorated conditions visible on the 
exterior of the building and that the brick siding appears to be in good condition.  Mr. Nairn 
stated that no landscaping, which is called for in the design guidelines, has been proposed, but 
that there are also some utilities beneath the sidewalk of East Rosser Avenue that could be 
disrupted by tree roots. 
 
Mr. Nairn stated that, based on information contained in the staff report, staff recommends 
approval of the Rehabilitation Renaissance Zone project 418 East Rosser Avenue for office lease 
space, as presented in all submitted documents and materials, a 100% property tax exemption on 
the building for five years and an exemption from state tax on income derived from the location 
for five years with the following conditions: 
 
1. 
Downtown Design Review is approved prior to initiation of any 
improvements to the exterior of the building. 
 
Mr. Whittey asked if there were any construction bids submitted.  Mr. Nairn stated that he has 
not seen bids but the project cost amount he mentioned was submitted by the applicant. 
 
Chair Christianson opened the public hearing. 
 
There being no comments, Chair Christianson closed the public hearing. 
 
MOTION: 
A motion was made by Mr. Zenker and seconded by Mr. Keiser to approve the 
Rehabilitation Renaissance Zone project for the building at 418 East Rosser 
Avenue as presented in all submitted documents and materials, a 100% property 
tax exemption on the building for five years and an exemption from state tax on 
income derived from the location for five years, with the following condition: 
 
1. Downtown Design Review is approved prior to initiation of any

Mr. Walth stated that he was concerned with the proposed use of the building since most 
Renaissance Zone projects have a known end use. 
 
DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW – 418 EAST ROSSER AVENUE 
JJ HAGENESS RENOVATION, LLC – FAÇADE ALTERATIONS 
 
Mr. Nairn gave an overview of the staff report and stated that the applicant, JJ Hageness 
Renovation, LLC, is requesting approval for exterior alterations of a Rehabilitation Renaissance 
Zone project for use as office lease space at 418 East Rosser Avenue.  Mr. Nairn stated that the 
applicant intends to modify the exterior of the building with the addition of cladding in a blue 
color to accent the southeast corner, roof line, and entrance from East Rosser Avenue, and also 
intends to replace all windows. 
 
Mr. Nairn stated that the blue cladding material and dimensions have not been submitted to 
Authority members.  The proposed façade alteration does not complement the context of 
surrounding buildings and does not conform to design guidelines within the DC – Downtown 
Core zoning district.  He stated that the building could also be historic, according to the 
ordinance, because it is over 50 years old, although it is currently not listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places 
 
Mr. Nairn stated that, based on the findings contained in the staff report, staff recommends 
continuation of Downtown Design Review for the proposed design for façade alterations at 418 
East Rosser Avenue, allowing time for staff and technical advisors to work with the applicant on 
a design that meets City requirements. 
 
Mr. Keiser asked if there was adequate parking if the building were to be used as a clinic.   Mr. 
Nairn stated that this property is located within the downtown parking district and no off-street 
parking is  is required in this district by City ordinance. 
 
Mr. Fink asked that since the use is not yet known what would the process be for changing the 
use of the building.  Mr. Nairn stated that if the applicant wished to change the use, this would 
typically involve building code and parking review but no zoning change at that location would 
be necessary. 
 
Mr. Hageness stated that the intent is to create an office building, not a clinic and that the interior 
layout plan is for office space. 
 
Mr. Walth asked if heating and ventilation and plumbing will be replaced and if the roof has 
been inspected.  Mr. Hageness stated that HVAC will be updated to high efficiency and a new 
stairway built on the west end.  He stated that the roof was inspected and it does not have to be 
replaced.

Chair Christianson asked if the applicant was gutting the interior.  Mr. Hageness stated that they 
were and that they are taking into account that some like open space offices and stated that the 
interior will all be new. 
 
Mr. Walth asked if there had been an exterior inspection.  Mr. Hageness stated that they did and 
there was a notation of exterior cracks in some of the brick but that no action was needed. 
 
Mr. Whittey stated that he agrees with staff’s recommendation that renderings and materials 
should be submitted before approval.  He stated that he would like to see all elevations.  He also 
recommended that street trees be included in the new plan. 
 
Mr. Keiser stated that the image provided by the applicant violates the nature of the 
neighborhood. 
 
Mr. Van Orman and Chair Christianson agreed and stated that they would like the applicant to 
present materials and plans. 
 
MOTION: 
A motion was made by Mr. Keiser and seconded by Mr. Fink to continue review 
of the design of the project at 418 East Rosser Avenue, allowing more time to 
provide additional information and consider revisions to the proposed exterior 
design of the building.  The motion passed unanimously with members Fink, 
Gawrylow, Keiser, Van Orman, Walth, Zenker and Chair Christianson voting in 
favor.   
 
Chair Christianson thanked the applicant for their project. 
 
DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW – 715 EAST BROADWAY AVENUE 
SANFORD OUTPATIENT SURGICAL CENTER – RENOVATION 
 
Mr. Nairn gave an overview of the staff report and stated that the applicant, Sanford Health, is 
requesting Downtown Design Review approval for renovation of a clinic for use as the Sanford 
Outpatient Surgical Center at 715 East Broadway Avenue.  Mr. Nairn stated that the renovation 
applies to both the interior and exterior of the building as well as site development.  He stated 
that the exterior renovation scope will include new exterior doors, windows, and canopy 
structures at entrances and on the northwest corner.  The siding material will remain EIFS, but 
will be repaired and repainted with similar colors with the potential for an accent color to match 
company branding.  A new metal panel will be installed on the roof to function as a screen for 
rooftop equipment since it is currently visible from ground-level.  He stated that site 
improvements will be made to connect parking lots and improve traffic flow.   
 
Mr. Nairn stated that, based on the findings contained in the staff report, staff recommends

Meeting Minutes – May 14, 2020

approval of the proposed design for the building at 715 East Broadway Avenue, as presented in 
all submitted documents and materials, with the following conditions: 
 
1. Safe and direct ADA-accessible pedestrian accommodations are provided 
from the north entrance to East Broadway Avenue and from the west 
entrance to North 7th Street. 
2. Existing street tree wells are enlarged and any removed trees are replanted 
with site development. 
3. Any substantive revisions to the approved design must be reconsidered by 
the Downtown Design Review Committee prior to implementation. 
 
Mr. Nairn introduced Nate Hacker of JLG Architects who, in turn, introduced Cole Johnson, 
Sanford Health. 
 
Mr. Johnson stated that Sanford Health submitted plans using enterprise standards with brick and 
pre-cast stone and mentioned that he will return to meet with Authority members or technical 
staff regarding signage at a later time, according to Downtown Design Review standards. 
 
Mr. Hacker thanked Renaissance Zone Authority members and staff for the great working 
relationship he has experienced.  He stated that they will add pedestrian pathways in two 
locations and would like to propose two enhanced traffic areas off East Broadway Avenue.  He 
stated that he is still evaluating flow between parcels, with separate lots for staff and patient 
parking.  He emphasized using enterprise standards using thinbrick and canopies on north and 
south corners.  He added that corner elements would also be brick or cast stone and EIFS.  He 
stated that the revised submittal was to patch and repair the EIFS around the building and repaint 
in a color which would complement the brick and stone.  He stated that the plans call for new 
windows and doors in a new waiting and service area, and also stated that there would be 
sidewalk repairs. 
 
Mr. Walth asked if staff or Authority members would review the materials and colors.  Mr. 
Hacker stated that he is in the process of selecting materials and amenable to providing materials 
and renderings to Authority members for review. 
 
Mr. Walth stated that he was fine with staff reviewing materials.  Mr. Nairn stated that staff 
would also review for adequate pedestrian accommodations and modifying street tree wells as 
Forestry has recommended.  Mr. Nairn added that these two items are in the suggested staff 
conditions for approval and added that in off-line discussions with the applicant they have voiced 
their willingness to work with staff to achieve those goals. 
 
Mr. Johnson clarified that new windows are only expected to be changed if they are a mismatch 
to the majority opaque-style windows.

DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW – 420 EAST MAIN AVENUE 
SCHUETT COMPANIES, INC – RENOVATION 
 
Mr. Nairn gave an overview of the staff report and stated that the applicant, Schuett Companies, 
Inc., is requesting Downtown Design Review approval of revisions to an approved design for the 
rehabilitation of the Patterson Place apartment at 420 East Main Avenue.  Mr. Nairn stated that 
Downtown Design Review approval was granted by the Downtown Design Review Committee 
on November 14, 2019. 
 
Mr. Nairn stated that the applicant is proposing three revisions to the approved design.  
Previously, all stucco was to be removed and a cupped metal tile panel was to be used to replace 
historic brick that was unavailable.  The National Park Service has requested that the metal 
panels no longer be utilized and the stucco on both the north and west sides will be repaired or 
repainted as necessary.  The stucco that was placed over brick would be removed on the south 
and east sides facing the streets with the exception of portions of the 10th floor, where brick was 
found to not be present.  Secondly, the outdoor stairwell previously proposed within the right-of-
way has been removed from the plan, and therefore no encroachment agreement would be 
necessary.  Thirdly, one of the two rooftop signs has been removed from the design.  The new 
design still includes a rooftop sign reading “Patterson Place” facing south. 
 
Mr. Nairn stated that, based on the findings contained in the staff report, staff recommends 
approval of the proposed revisions to the design for 420 East Main Avenue, as presented in all 
submitted documents and materials, waiving the prohibition of rooftop signs in Section 4-04-
09(4) (Specific Provisions for Downtown/Prohibited Signs) with the condition that any 
substantive revisions to the approved design must be reconsidered by the Downtown Design 
Review Committee prior to implementation.

Façade improvements associated with overall 
rehabilitation of building 
 
Staff Analysis 
 
Existing building at 418 East Rosser Avenue 
JJ Hageness Renovation, LLC is requesting Downtown 
Design Review approval for façade improvements to 
418 East Rosser Avenue. A Rehabilitation Renaissance 
Zone project on this property was approved by the 
Renaissance Zone Authority on May 14, 2020, and by 
the City Commission on May 25. Approval from the 
State Department of Commerce is pending, as of 
writing. During their meeting, the Renaissance Zone 
Authority continued Downtown Design Review of this 
project. 
The applicant has revised their planned façade 
improvements. At this time, the exterior alterations of 
the building are limited to replacement of all windows. 
Minor repairs to bricks may be necessary as well. 
The windows would be all be comprised of fixed 
aluminum frames in an anodized bronze color with 
double-paned glass. The preferred glass would have a 
minor tint, although three options are presented and 
attached to this staff report. The preferred pane is in 
the middle. The ordinance requires transparent ground 
floor windows, and a certain degree of tint has 
historically been acceptable as long as visibility is 
maintained.  
The individual window panes will be about 5’ tall by 4’ 
wide, evenly spaced within the existing horizontal 
openings.

Community Development Department Staff Report

The design guidelines call for integration with the 
natural environment, including greenery and 
landscaping. There are unique constraints to this site. 
Public utilities exist beneath the sidewalk on the north 
side of East Rosser Avenue that could be disrupted 
during tree well installation. The sidewalk was 
reconstructed in 2018 and tree wells were removed at 
this time. 
Given these constraints, staff recommends applying 
landscaping material in a similar nature to the 
adjoining property to the west owned by American 
Bank Center, which was approved as a Renaissance 
Zone project in 2010. This would involve a series of 
planting beds for low-profile plant material along 
Rosser Avenue and one street tree in the sidewalk of 
North 5th Street. The City Forester supports this 
recommendation. 
 
Planting beds with grasses on adjoining property 
Required Findings of Fact 
1. The proposed design conforms to Sections 4-04-
09, 14-04-21.1, and 14-04-21.2 of the 
Bismarck Code of Ordinances, relating to Design 
Standards within the DC – Downtown Core and 
DF – Downtown Fringe zoning districts. 
2. The proposed design generally conforms to the 
purpose and intent of the 2015 Downtown 
Design Guidelines, and other relevant plans and 
policies. 
Staff Recommendation 
Based on the above findings, staff recommends 
approval of the proposed design for 418 East Rosser 
as presented in all submitted documents and materials, 
with the following conditions: 
1. Three planting beds are installed in the 
sidewalk of North Rosser Street planted with 
karl foerster grass or an equivalent approved 
by the City Forester, and one street tree is 
installed in the sidewalk of North 5th Street in 
compliance with Downtown Streetscape 
Standards. 
2. Any substantive revisions to the approved 
design must be reconsidered by the Downtown 
Design Review Committee prior to 
implementation.
