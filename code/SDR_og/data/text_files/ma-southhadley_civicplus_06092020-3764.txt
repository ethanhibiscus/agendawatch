The Planning Board will commence virtual public hearings on pending and new applications beginning 
June 15, 2020. The Planning Board suggested that there be an opportunity for the public to test their 
ability to access and utilize the Town’s virtual meeting platform – Google Hangout Meet – prior to the 
first public hearing. This will provide the public an opportunity to become familiar with how to access the 
platform and where the various controls are found on their particular device. Accordingly, the Planning & 
Conservation Department has scheduled three such sessions as identified below: 
 
Monday, June 8, 2020 at 3:00 p.m. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Monday, June 8, 2020 at 6:30 p.m. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tuesday, June 9, 2020 at 3:00 p.m. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In each instance, staff will be online for 30 minutes to keep the test meeting open. Persons should also 
become familiar with the Board’s Virtual Hearing Guidelines/Protocols – posted online at the following
