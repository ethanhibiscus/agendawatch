APPROVING THE COST ITEMS OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE MAYOR AND THE BOARD OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS OF THE

ASSOCATION OF FIRE FIGHTERS FROM JULY 1, 2019 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2023

COMMITTEE 
ASSIGNMENT: 
 
 
FISCAL NOTE: 
The cost analysis is attached.  The use of the unassigned fund balance to 
cover a deficit in an operating budget is unprecedented in the City of Nashua and Financial 
Services does not recommend starting now.  In consulting with the City’s Financial Advisor, 
Hilltop Securities, their concern is the cost of the contract over the next two years as all 
municipalities will have significant fiscal issues in FY2021 and FY2022 resulting from the 
continuing COVID-19 Pandemic. 
_____________________________________________________________________________ 
ANALYSIS 
 
This resolution approves the cost items of a collective bargaining agreement between the Nashua 
Board of Fire Commissioners and Local #789, International Association of Fire Fighters.   
The Agreement has a term of four years, commencing on July 1, 2019 and expiring on June 30, 
2023.  The board of aldermen must vote whether or not to approve the cost items of this contract 
within thirty days of receipt.  RSA 273-A:3 II (c).  The redlined copy of the CBA does not include 
73 deleted pages of old salary grids that were part of Article 13 of the prior contract.  The redlined 
copy only includes the newly proposed salary grids, which are now appendices at the end of the 
CBA. 
 
The resolution also authorizes the transfer of funds from “Contingency for Negotiations” into 
“Fire - Payroll Adjustments” to partially fund the FY2020 base salary adjustments contained in 
the collective bargaining agreement.  Charter Sec. 53 permits the Board of Aldermen to transfer 
any unencumbered appropriation balance or any portion thereof from one department, fund or 
agency to another.  NRO § 5-130, H provides that “when proposed legislation to transfer or 
reappropriate a particular appropriation or portion thereof has had its first reading, such funds 
shall not be expended or transferred while the legislation is pending”. 
 
This resolution also supplementally appropriates unassigned fund balance to fund the remainder 
of the FY2020 base salary adjustments contained in the collective bargaining agreement.  Charter 
Sec. 53 permits specific non-budget, supplementary appropriations.  There should be notice and 
a public hearing.  A two-thirds vote is required under Charter Sec. 56-b for an item or amount 
not in the mayor’s budget.  A roll call is required under Charter Sec. 49.

The total number of personnel designated by the above formula shall be 
temporarily reduced by any personnel absent as set out in Paragraph C, 
subparagraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 above.  The designation of the above formula for 
safety purposes shall not operate as a restriction on the stations or pieces of 
apparatus to which individual personnel may be assigned.  The Fire Commission 
will designate in writing which pieces of apparatus are to be in service at each 
station for each duty shift.  Ten (10) days’ notice will be given in writing prior to 
any change in designation which results in a piece of apparatus being taken out of 
service for seven (7) days or less.  Twenty-one (21) days’ notice will be given in 
writing prior to any change in designation which results in a piece of apparatus 
being taken out of service for any period in excess of seven (7) days.

E.

equipment, tools, safety devices, protective clothing and other modern implements 
of fire rescue services so as to provide the City with an efficient and safety-minded 
fire fighting organization to give the City full protection within the limits of the 
annual budget as passed by the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen. 
 
 
F. 
After the four Dispatch Supervisors are hired, Tthere shall be no less 
than two three Fire Dispatchers or Dispatch Supervisors on duty at all times, with 
the exception of time taken under Article 15, F.  If a third Fire Dispatcher or 
Dispatch Supervisor is needed, every effort will be made to call in a third Fire 
Dispatcher or Dispatch Supervisor from the remaining pool of Fire Dispatchers and 
 
 
9 
Dispatch Supervisors.  If unable to secure replacement from off duty Fire 
Dispatchers and Dispatch Supervisors, the dispatch center will operate with the 
remaining two members for the remainder of the shift.  This language only applies 
if a member must leave after their shift has begun. 
 
 
F.1. If three Fire Dispatchers are working on a shift, the most senior of the 
three Fire Dispatchers working will receive Article 34 Working Out of 
Classification pay for performing the duties of a Dispatch Supervisor.  As the 
Dispatch Supervisor salary grids do not have a probation rate column, the “2 
years” column will be used as the probationary rate for that position.  The specific 
pay in the “2 year” column will be based on any Dispatch Supervisor certifications 
that the Fire Dispatcher has. 
 
 
G.

Article 15 - OVERTIME 
 
A. 
When a Fire Officer or Fire Private is called back to work shift 
coverage he/she shall be paid the regular straight time rate and shall not be entitled 
to the overtime rate until that member has worked his/her regularly schedule work 
week hours in the seven (7) day established cycle plus an additional five (5) hours 
at the regular straight time rate if section F applies and four (4) hours if section F is 
not applicable.  (For example, a member assigned to work a thirty-eight (38) hour 
work week would not receive overtime for shift coverage until that member had 
worked forty-three (43) hours if section F is applicable and forty-two (42) hours if 
section F is not applicable during that seven (7) day established cycle.)  For the 
purpose of determining whether a member is entitled to overtime during any seven 
(7) day established cycle, hours not worked due to sickness, vacation or paid leave, 
will not count towards the regularly scheduled work week hours. 
 
B. 
When a Fire Officer or Fire Private is held over beyond the end of the 
regular work shift (day/night) he/she shall be paid time and one half for all hours 
worked with a one hour minimum pay rule. 
 
 
 
15 
 
C. 
For Fire Officers and Fire Privates - in the event that an emergency 
need for overtime work occurs, other than shift coverage and training classes, as 
reasonably determined by the Chief, overtime in excess of regular scheduled hours 
of duty shall be paid at time and one-half the basic rate, with a two (2) hour 
minimum pay rule. 
 
 
D. 
When a specialist is kept beyond his/her regular tour of duty, he/she 
shall be paid time and one-half the basic rate with a one (1) hour minimum pay 
rule. In the event a specialist is called back to work after the specialist's duty shift 
has been completed, the specialist shall be paid at time and one-half the basic rate 
for the hours actually worked, with a two-hour (2) minimum pay rule. 
 
 
E. 
Fire Dispatchers and Dispatch Supervisors shall be paid time and one-
half (1 1/2) the basic rate for all hours worked in excess of forty-two (42) hours per 
week averaged over the eight week cycle forty (40) hours per weekly pay period.  
For the purpose of determining whether a member is entitled to overtime during a 
weekly pay period, hours not worked due to sickness, vacation or paid leave will 
not count towards the regularly scheduled work week hours. 
 
 
F. 
An employee upon being notified to work overtime after working a 
full duty shift when no emergency is involved will be given one (1) hour leave 
with pay to attend to personal business.  The one (1) hour leave will be given at 
such time as to permit the purchase of food during supermarket store hours, prior 
to the meal for which the food is to be used.  The hour of leave will be given at a 
time set at the discretion of the Chief or designee. 
 
 
G. 
If an employee is notified to work shift coverage/overtime for both the 
day and night shift on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day, he will be given three 
(3) hours consecutively to attend to personal business.  This time will include the 
time allotted in paragraph F above. 
 
 
H. 
The Union shall establish by platoon for Fire Officers and Fire 
Privates two (2) overtime lists of those employees who hold permanent positions 
defined under Article 12, Paragraph D, who wish to be offered the opportunity to 
serve overtime on a voluntary basis.  The first list for each category shall be for 
day shift overtime opportunities and the second list shall be night shift overtime 
opportunities.  Overtime shall be first offered to those employees whose names are 
on the voluntary overtime list and who are qualified to serve the overtime in the 
opinion of the Chief or designee.  The offers shall be made on a rotating basis on 
each of the appropriate lists, and employees who decline overtime when first 
 
 
16 
offered shall obtain a suitable replacement subject to the approval of the Chief or 
designee.  No employee shall be permitted to start a shift of shift coverage 
overtime, if that employee has worked more than seventy-six (76) hours in that  
payroll week, except under conditions in B above.  Employees who are absent shall 
lose their place in the rotation for the period that they are absent except when on 
vacation, bereavement leave, while involved in paid department training, on 
military leave of a month or less, or Union business.  Union business will include 
personal leave that is taken for that reason.  Additionally, an employee, who is 
scheduled on Union business and is unable to work his/her overtime because of it, 
will not lose their place in the rotation. 
 
The Union shall keep current and post the voluntary overtime list every 
twelve months providing that employees may be added or deleted as needed by 
reason of transfer, new hires, promotions or like conditions.  Upon being furnished 
the voluntary overtime list prior to posting, the department will furnish the Union 
with all employee telephone numbers unless an employee has refused permission 
for the release of the number.  In the event of refusal, the Union shall be so advised 
and shall then be responsible for the obtaining of the telephone number.  All 
employees shall be given the opportunity to work overtime on a voluntary basis 
after they have satisfactorily completed 120 days of employment in accordance 
with this subsection F. 
 
 
I. 
All employees agree to work overtime at the request of the Chief or 
designee.  If an employee is unable to work the assigned overtime, the employee to 
whom the overtime is assigned will obtain a suitable replacement and will be 
allowed to use City telephones to make such arrangements.  All replacements are 
subject to the approval of the Chief or designee. 
 
 
J. 
Upon request, the City will make available the involuntary overtime 
assignment list.  All involuntary overtime shall be rotated on an equitable basis. 
The rotation list for involuntary overtime shall be kept current, posted and reposted 
by the City after every transfer. 
 
 
K. 
Positions required by Article 12, Paragraph D, shall be designated as 
permanent positions. If one of these positions is vacant as a result of sickness, 
injury, vacation, or bereavement leave or leave provided for under paragraph 7B, 
that absence will constitute a temporary opening due to absence. The Department 
will cover temporary openings due to absence in accordance with the provisions of 
Paragraphs L through M below. Additional employees above those required to fill 
permanent positions defined in Article 12, Paragraph D shall not be used to cover 
 
 
17 
temporary openings due to absence, and the absence of such employees for any 
reason, will create a temporary opening under this Article. 
 
 
L. 
When a temporary opening occurs in the Permanent Fire Officer ranks 
due to absence, a Permanent Fire Officer shall be used to cover the opening.  In the 
event the Department uses an employee to cover any opening created by the use of 
the latter Permanent Fire Officer, that opening shall be offered to a Permanent Fire 
Officer on the voluntary overtime list under Paragraph F above.  When any 
additional opening occurs in the Permanent Fire Officer ranks, that opening may be 
offered to an Acting Fire Officer or a Permanent Fire Officer on the voluntary 
overtime list under Paragraph F above.  In the event no Fire Officer on the list 
under Paragraph F above fills a temporary opening created by a Permanent Fire 
Officer absence, any Permanent or Acting Officer may be required to work 
overtime.  Any Permanent or Acting Officer required to work overtime may, at the  
employee's option, allow a Permanent Fire Officer or Acting Fire Officer to work 
the overtime, provided that the Permanent Fire Officer or Acting Fire Officer is 
qualified in the opinion of the Chief or designee.  All coverage of openings under 
this paragraph shall be paid in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph A. The above 
should not be construed as to prohibit the Officer in Charge from assigning the 
replacement Fire Officers to work specific work areas. 
 
 
M. 
When a temporary opening occurs in the Permanent Fire Private ranks 
due to absence, the following shall apply: 
 
1. 
All temporary openings due to absence shall be offered to 
Permanent Fire Privates on the voluntary overtime list under Paragraph E 
above to be paid in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph A. 
 
2. 
If an overtime opportunity to fill a temporary opening is not 
filled by a Permanent Fire Private whose name is on the overtime list under 
Paragraph E, any Fire Private may be required to cover the opening shall be 
paid in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph A. Any Fire Private required 
to work overtime may, at the employee's option, allow another Fire Private 
to work the overtime provided that Fire Private is qualified in the opinion of 
the Chief or designee. The above should not be construed as to prohibit the 
Officer in Charge from assigning the replacement Fire Privates to work 
specific work areas. 
 
 
N. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs A through L above, in 
the event the Commission takes one or more pieces of apparatus out of service by 
 
 
18 
reason of operational requirements, and there are either temporary or permanent 
reductions in staffing because of that Commission action, those employees affected 
by the temporary or permanent reductions shall be assigned to fill permanent 
vacancies for which they are qualified, and the first opportunity to cover temporary 
vacancies for which they are qualified on a straight time basis before the temporary 
vacancy coverage is made on an overtime basis. The Department will give the 
Union notice in accordance with Article 12, Paragraph D, prior to taking one or 
more pieces of apparatus out of service, except for normal maintenance and 
repairs. 
 
 
O. 
In the event that an employee is injured or becomes ill while working 
overtime and is not able to return to work, the injured or ill employee shall receive 
all benefits provided in Article 22 (Paid Sick and Injury Leave). In the event that 
an employee is replacing another employee or is working regular overtime, and 
becomes ill from a non-work-related cause, he/she will be paid for the hours of 
overtime hired and the hours not worked shall be deducted from his/her sick leave. 
 
 
P. 
Certain Overtime Callback Procedures. 
 
1. 
Emergency Overtime – In the event that an emergency need 
(multiple alarm, etc.) for overtime work occurs, Fire Alarm will notify those 
members who live out of the immediate area last, the immediate area is 
defined in Article 37, Section B.  Members after being notified of the 
emergency shall respond to the emergency within one hour of being notified 
or the member will be considered as not having reported for duty and, 
therefore, no compensation will be due.  However, if such a member is 
assigned duties by the Chief or designee upon his/her late arrival, the 
member will be compensated commencing at the time such duties are 
assigned. 
 
2. 
Voluntary Overtime 
 
a. 
Those members on the overtime list who live out of the 
Nashua area would be called. 
 
b. 
Each member, after being notified that s/he has overtime 
and at which station, shall fill the vacancy within one hour of being 
notified. 
 
 
 
19 
c. 
If the person contacted is unable to fill the vacancy 
within the hour s/he shall make arrangements so that the vacancy shall 
be filled within the hour. 
 
d. 
In order to provide for the most efficient replacement of 
personnel in the event of a vacancy, the Department and Union may 
agree to a modified method for notifying personnel on the voluntary 
overtime list. 
 
3. 
Detail Overtime List 
 
The Fire Department shall establish a rotating list in order to provide 
for the equal distribution of assignments within this detail classification.  
Qualified members who agree to work the detail will be paid one and one 
half times their regular rate of pay with a (2) two-hour minimum pay rule. 
 
Detail lists will be comprised of members who volunteer to be on the 
lists and shall rotate with senior members placed at the top of the list.  Detail 
lists will not be used to cover vacation or sick leave vacancies, unless agree 
to by the Department and Union.  Detail lists will be posted each January for 
a period of fifteen (15) days to allow members to join or exit the list. 
 
Work that is specific to a division or classification and requires 
specific training or certification: 
 
This detail work opportunity will be offered to individuals in the 
division or classification. If it is determined by agreement of the Department 
and Union that a genuine need for additional, trained, members to fill 
temporary vacancies or detail work opportunities exists, then, a list of 
prerequisites/training a member needs to attain in order to be placed on a 
covering detail list will be agreed upon by the Department and Union.  
Detail or overtime opportunities may then be offered to members on this 
Specifically Trained Detail List, with due regard to seniority, only after all 
members in the division or classification that normally cover the opportunity 
are given the chance to fill the need for all members are unable to work due 
to too many hours already worked in the pay week. In the event that a detail 
or temporary vacancy exists and must be filled and all members of the detail 
list are not interested, the responsibility to fill this need will always be 
relayed to the normal covering division or classification regardless of hours 
work, (examples of work that will be pertinent to this paragraph will include, 
 
 
20 
but not be limited to: dispatcher coverage during hardship periods, certified 
instructor work, inspections, line work, mechanic work). 
 
4. 
Administrative Overtime 
 
Members who are requested to attend administrative or committee 
meetings outside of their normal scheduled work hours shall be compensated 
one and one-half (1 1/2) times their hourly rate with a one hour minimum. 
No physical labor is to be performed by attendees on administrative 
overtime. Work details or activities requiring labor by any attendee are not 
considered administrative overtime. 
 
Article 16 – SENIORITY 
 
 
A. 
Seniority shall be determined to be the period of uninterrupted 
employment with the Nashua Fire Department and Nashua Fire Rescue since the 
last date of employment.  The City shall establish a seniority list, and it shall be 
brought up to date each year during the month of November and posted on all fire 
station bulletin boards for a period of not less than thirty (30) days, and a copy 
mailed to the Secretary of the Union. Any objection to the seniority list as posted 
shall be reported within thirty (30) days of the end of the posting period by the 
individual employee. Seniority will commence from the first day of employment 
on a full-time basis as a probationary employee. Corrections to the seniority list 
brought to the City's attention after the thirty (30) day period will be corrected, but 
would not negate any benefits already awarded based on seniority. 
 
 
B. 
In the event of more than one employee being hired simultaneously, 
after July 1, 1989, the order of seniority will be determined by the dates that the 
Department received the application from the employee. If date of hire and the date 
the application is received are the same, employee seniority will be determined 
alphabetically by last name. 
 
 
C. 
All newly hired employees shall serve a probationary period of nine 
(9) months or complete Career Fire Fighter certification, whichever comes later, 
and shall have no rights based on seniority during this period. They shall, however, 
insofar as applicable, be subject to all other clauses in this Agreement with the 
exception of the use of the grievance procedure for termination or discipline 
reasons. All employees who have completed said nine (9) months of service or 
Career Fire Fighter certification, whichever comes later, shall be known as 
permanent employees and the probationary period shall be credited as part of the 
 
 
21 
employee's seniority. The City agrees to provide training for certification as Career 
Fire Fighter at its expense in accordance with State law. In the event the employee 
is absent by reason of illness or injury, the Department may, at its discretion, 
extend the probationary period by the amount of time absent over seven (7) duty 
shifts during that nine (9) month probationary period, up to three (3) additional 
months. 
 
 
D. 
In addition to the bargaining unit seniority list, Nashua Fire Rescue 
shall establish a time in rank seniority list for each division.  Time in rank in any 
division shall commence on the first day at work in that division and end when the 
employee leaves the division for any reason. 
 
Article 17 - PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS AND RECALL  
 
 
A. 
In the case of a reduction of personnel within the bargaining unit, the 
employee with the least seniority shall be laid off first.  In the event an employee 
must be involuntary demoted as a result of a reduction of personnel, such demotion 
shall be accomplished in accordance with the time in ranks seniority list for the 
division and the employee with the least seniority shall be demoted first. 
 
 
B. 
The names of employees laid off from the bargaining unit will be 
maintained on a recall list for two years from the date of layoff and such 
employees will be offered recall in the order of greatest seniority if vacancies occur 
in their job classifications. If a laid off employee is notified by telephone or by a 
letter sent to his/her last known address on the records of the Fire Department to 
return to work, he/she must notify the Department within two (2) days of his/her 
intentions to comply or accept and must report to work within ten (10) days of such 
notification or he/she shall cease to have any rights based on seniority and shall be 
terminated. Recalled employees who return to work will be credited with prior 
length of service, provided such employee has not withdrawn his/her contributions 
from the State Retirement System. 
 
 
C. 
If a driver's job is totally eliminated or is not covered on a 24-hour 
basis, any driver affected shall be given the opportunity to fill another full-time 
driver's job of his or her choice on the basis of seniority, unless he or she is shown 
not to be qualified. In the event of reassignment, the driver shall be obligated to 
complete only the remaining portion of his/her driver probationary period not 
completed at the time of reassignment. 
 
 
 
22 
 
D. 
Any employee demoted as the result of a reduction of personnel 
which is involuntary and non-disciplinary will be maintained on a list.  Employees 
who are on the demotion list shall be reassigned to fill any vacancies that may 
occur in the division from which they were demoted in according with the 
demotion list and time in ranks seniority list for the division. 
 
Article 18 - APPOINTMENTS, PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS 
 
 
A. 
The State of New Hampshire Fire Service Training Division or an 
equivalent organization agreed upon in writing by the City and the Union shall 
conduct and supervise written examinations for available promotions within the 
Nashua Fire Department which are specified below and which specify a 
requirement for such examination. 
 
 
B. 
The Testing Agency shall submit to the Board of Fire Commissioners 
the names of the candidates who pass the written examinations for each available 
promotional opportunity. 
 
 
C. 
All promotions to classifications in the bargaining unit and to the 
Deputy Chief and Deputy Chief-Training classification out of the unit shall be 
made from the ranks in accordance with the procedures set forth under this 
Paragraph C, and in Paragraphs D through N below, unless those from the ranks 
are shown not to be qualified. Qualifications, in part, for the rank of Lieutenant, 
Acting Lieutenant, Fire Alarm Lineman, Inspector/Public Education Officer, 
Assistant Superintendent, Inspector/Investigator, Fire Marshall, Superintendent, 
Captain, Deputy Chief and Deputy Chief Training shall be determined by a written 
examination conducted by the Testing Agency. A passing mark of seventy percent 
(70%) must be attained.  Years of service on the Nashua Fire Department will add 
one (1) point for each year of service in-grade up to ten (10) years and one-half 
(1/2) point for each additional year of service in-grade thereafter will be added to 
the passing written examination mark.  However, if all members can test for a 
position, one (1) point for each year of service in the Nashua Fire Department will 
be added to the passing written examination mark.  A passing written examination 
mark of seventy percent (70%) must be attained before such seniority points are 
added. Seniority points shall be calculated based on the effective date of the test 
results, and shall be recalculated based on the date each vacancy occurs. Seniority 
points shall be added only once. 
 
 
D. 
For vacancies in Specialist Divisions, the five (5) candidates who pass 
the examinations and attain the highest combined scores of the examinations and 
 
 
23 
seniority points shall be the eligible candidates considered in accordance with 
promotional policy by the Fire Commissioners for the first vacancy.  However, for 
vacancies in the Fire Marshal Division, as of January 1, 2021, to be eligible to take 
the exam, members must have their Fire Inspector I and Fire Investigator 
certifications.  For each additional vacancy, the candidate who attains the next 
highest combined scores shall be added to the list of candidates. If the foregoing 
process results in there being less than five (5) candidates available for 
consideration, the Fire Commission shall consider the candidates who do pass the 
examinations in accordance with previous arbitration decisions. In the event the 
Fire Commissioners wish to consider candidates' conformance to performance 
standards, written copies of such performance standards shall be furnished to each 
member of the bargaining unit at least six (6) months prior to the date of such 
consideration.  As part of the testing process, the Fire Commissioners may require 
all candidates for positions in the Mechanical and Fire Alarm divisions to 
participate in a practical skills examination process.  This Paragraph D shall apply 
to all promotions to classifications other than Deputy Chief, Captain, and 
Lieutenant. 
 
E. 
The written examinations for Lieutenant and Acting Lieutenant will 
be given in March. The day of the written examination will be rotated through the 
four different platoons.  The results of the written examination will stand for 
twenty-four (24) months from May 1 next following the administration of the 
examination. The posting for the examinations will contain the information in 
items (1) and (2) of Paragraph I.  For the rank of Lieutenant, the nine (9) 
candidates who pass the written examination and attain the highest combined 
scores of the written examination and in-grade service year points shall be the 
eligible candidates considered in the interview process described in Paragraphs J 
and K below.  These scores will be available at each stage of the promotional 
process. 
 
F. 
Written examinations for Captain and Deputy Chief will be given in 
March or April. The list of those who pass the written examination will stand for 
twenty-four (24) months from May 1 next following the administration of the 
examinations.  For the rank of Captain, the six (6) candidates who pass the written 
examination and attain the highest combined scores of the written examination and 
in-grade service year points shall be the eligible candidates considered in the 
interview process described in Paragraphs J and K below.  For the rank of Deputy 
Chief, the three (3) candidates who pass the written examination and attain the 
highest combined scores of the written examination and time in-grade points shall 
be the eligible candidates considered in the interview process described in 
 
 
24 
Paragraphs J and K below. These scores will be available at each stage of the 
promotional process. 
 
 
G. 
In the event that there is a tie for the ninth (9th) candidate for a 
Lieutenant vacancy; the sixth (6th) candidate for a Captain vacancy; or the third 
(3rd) candidate for a Deputy Chief vacancy, all candidates affected by the tie scores 
shall continue in the process. 
 
 
 
Should a tie occur as noted above, then at the Deputy Chief and oral 
interview steps (Paragraphs J and K), the highest ranked candidate shall be given a 
number equal to the number of candidates being considered and then so on to one 
(1) point for lowest ranked candidate.  However, in no case shall the final 
promotional lists exceed the following number of candidates: 
 
 
 
 
Lieutenant  
 nine (9); 
 
 
 
Captain 
 
 six (6); and 
 
 
 
Deputy Chiefs 
 three (3). 
 
 
H. 
Promotional opportunities occurring because of vacancies and new 
positions which the Fire Commissioners wish to fill on a permanent basis, and for 
which qualified candidates are not available on a current list under D, E and F 
above shall, except in an emergency be posted within ten (10) days after the 
vacancy occurs. The test date for each such vacancy shall be posted for a period of 
twenty (20) days, and each person eligible to take the test who is on vacation or 
other extended leave shall be sent a notification of the posting by mail.  For 
positions in the Suppression Division, the tests shall not be scheduled earlier than 
six (6) months after the initial date of posting to allow for study time.  For 
positions in the Specialist Division, tests shall not be scheduled earlier than forty-
five (45)  ninety (90) days after the initial date of posting to allow for study time. 
 
 
H.1. An initial posting for testing will be developed; this initial posting 
shall not meet all requirements included in Paragraph I.  The purpose of this 
posting is to establish numbers of members intending to test, for reasons of 
purchasing tests and discussions of test waivers.  The period of this initial posting 
shall be ten (10) days. 
 
 
I. 
All test postings shall include the following information:  
 
 
 
1. 
The study materials on which the examinations will be based. 
 
 
 
 
25 
 
2.  
All tests will be based upon relevant sources not to exceed 
1,400 pages of material.  Starting January 1, 2021, all tests for the Fire

disability which is not in conflict with the rulings of the worker's compensation 
specialist, differential pay to the amount of 3/4 of the regular full salary computed 
as specified above shall be continued for up to a maximum of an additional twenty-
six (26) weeks (with a minimum total payment of approved worker's compensation 
payments combined with City differential pay accounting to 3/4 of the maximum 
of such regular full salary applicable to Senior Privates/Senior Dispatchers). Such 
occupational sickness or disability shall not be charged to the accrued sick leave of

actual hours the employee is absent during scheduled duty hours. The operation of 
the bank and withdrawals therefrom shall be carried out by a committee of two (2) 
members of the bargaining unit, and one (1) administrator selected by the Chief. 
The committee shall establish its rules and regulations and shall require 
documentation from a physician supporting the request for sick leave bank

judged to have a light work capacity by his/her treating physician may be given a 
light duty assignment consistent with Fire Department functions, the employee’s 
physical capabilities and any limitations imposed by the treating physician.  The 
Department may promulgate policies and procedures from time to time in order to 
update and improve this program.  Light duty assignments shall be temporary, and 
will be calculated to facilitate the employee’s recovery and resumption of his/her

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MAYOR AND THE BOARD OF 
FIRE COMMISSIONERS OF THE CITY OF NASHUA, 
AND LOCAL -789 INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE 
FIGHTERS 
 
This is an agreement made this   
 day of  
 
 
 
, 2020, by 
and between the City of Nashua, New Hampshire, by its Mayor and the Board of 
Fire Commissioners duly authorized, hereafter referred to as the "City" and Local 
789, Nashua, New Hampshire, International Association of Fire Fighters, hereafter 
referred to as the “Union”. 
 
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein set forth, the parties hereto agree 
as follows: 
 
Article 1 – PURPOSES 
 
It is the purpose of this agreement to achieve and maintain harmonious relations 
between the City and the Union; to provide for equitable and peaceful adjustment 
of differences which may arise and to establish fair and equitable standards of 
wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and to continue the existing 
harmonious relationship between the Fire Department and its permanent 
employees, and to promote the morale, equal rights, well-being and security of the 
Fire Department's permanent employees. 
 
Article 2 - BARGAINING UNIT AND EXCLUSIONS 
 
The City hereby recognizes the International Association of Fire Fighters, Local 
#789, as the sole bargaining agent and sole and exclusive representative of all 
employees of the Nashua Fire Rescue Department, with the exception of the Chief, 
the Assistant Chief, the Deputy Chiefs, general maintenance person, and other 
civilian personnel for the purpose of bargaining with respect to wages, hours of 
duty and working conditions. Employees in the bargaining unit who perform 
office work are not included in these exceptions.  This agreement shall apply to all 
bargaining unit employees of the Fire Department as defined above, with the 
exception that probationary employees in Article 16 may not use the grievance 
procedure in cases of termination or discipline. 
 
 
 
2 
 
Article 3 - UNION SECURITY 
 
A. 
Subject to compliance with applicable law, for the term of this 
agreement or any extension thereof, all employees who are Union members on the 
date of the execution of this agreement or who shall thereafter join the Union 
during the term of this agreement shall remain members of the Union in good 
standing as to payment of dues as a condition of continued employment by the 
City, providing that the Union shall set a 15 consecutive day period during the term 
of this agreement during which such members shall be able to withdraw their 
membership in writing. 
 
 
B. 
Subject to all compliance with all applicable law, all new employees 
employed during the term of this agreement shall within nine (9) months after their 
hire, become members of the Union and continue as such as a condition of 
continued employment.  However, any such employee who withdraws their 
membership from the Union shall render to the Union a service fee commensurate 
with their fair share apportionment for the cost of collective bargaining and the 
administration of this collective bargaining agreement.  Such service fee may be 
deducted pursuant to the terms of Article 10 of this agreement. 
 
 
C. 
The City agrees that it will not discriminate against, intimidate or 
coerce any employee in the exercise of his/her rights to bargain collectively 
through the Union or on account of membership in or activities on behalf of the 
Union. 
 
 
D. 
It is also agreed that factors such as sex, race, color, national origin, 
religion, lawful political or employee's organization affiliation, age, marital status 
or non-disqualifying handicap are not considerations in evaluating the 
qualifications of an employee or prospective employee. 
 
 
E. 
It is also agreed that the parties hereto ascribe to and support the 
implementation of the City of Nashua's affirmative action program. 
 
Article 4 - MANAGEMENT'S RIGHTS 
 
Except as otherwise expressly and specifically provided in this agreement, the 
Union recognizes and agrees that the supervision, management and control of the 
City's business, operations, working force and plant are exclusively vested in the 
management of the City.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the 
 
 
3 
Union recognizes and agrees that the right to plan, direct and control the City's 
business, methods, operations and working force; to hire, promote, transfer and 
temporarily assign bid positions for absences in excess of 45 days, and lay off 
employees, to grant leave, and lawfully and for just and proper cause, to demote, 
discipline, suspend or discharge employees; and the right to determine the hours 
and schedules of work and the work tasks and standards of performance for 
employees, is vested exclusively in the City.  The foregoing shall not be taken, 
however, as a limitation upon the rights of the Union to negotiate for working 
conditions and represent the employees covered hereby in the procedures provided 
in this agreement and nothing in this agreement shall be so interpreted as to change 
any benefits now enjoyed by employees unless such change is specifically covered 
in provisions of this agreement other than this Article 4. 
 
Article 5 - CONFORMITY WITH LAWS, CHARTER AND RULES AND 
REGULATIONS 
 
Mindful of all existing New Hampshire laws, the City of Nashua Charter and 
Ordinances provisions, rules and regulations of the Nashua Fire Department and 
every other applicable law, all provisions of this agreement shall be subject to and 
consistent with such laws and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Board of 
Fire Commissioners. The Union will be informed of any new rules and regulations 
to be applied after the signing of this agreement and any such new rules and 
regulations shall not be in conflict with or supersede any other provisions of this 
agreement.  The City of Nashua and the Board of Fire Commissioners agree not to 
make any law or regulation or to adopt rules relative to the terms and conditions of 
employment that would invalidate any portion of this agreement. 
 
Article 6 – INDEMNIFICATION 
 
The City will maintain in effect for the life of this agreement and will have all Fire 
Department personnel named as insureds thereunder, the public liability insurance 
in force on the effective date of this agreement, provided, however, that if the City 
is unable to procure and maintain such insurance, it will indemnify the members of 
the bargaining unit in the same manner and to the same extent as the City's present 
insurance coverage now provides.

6 
Article 10 - UNION DUES 
 
 
A. 
The City agrees to deduct, once each week, dues in an amount 
certified to be current by the treasurer of the Union, from the pay of those 
employees who individually request in writing that those deductions be made.  The 
total amount of the deductions shall be remitted by the City to the treasurer of the 
Union.  At the request of the Union, such remittance may be made by direct 
deposit or electronic transfer to the Union's Bank. 
 
 
B. 
The City shall have no obligation to collect dues or service fee 
deductions in the event that an employee has no pay coming to him or her, or the 
check is not large enough to satisfy the dues deduction, no deduction will be made 
for that week. 
 
 
C. 
In no case will the City collect fines or assessments for the Union 
other than under A above. 
 
 
D. 
The Union shall indemnify and save harmless the city in and on 
account of any and all claims, suits and damages arising out of or in relation to 
such dues or service fee deductions. 
 
Article 11 - PROTECTION OF CITY PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
 
It shall be the responsibility of any employee having custody of any equipment and 
property to see that it is properly cared for, kept clean and returned to its proper 
place of storage.  Drivers shall be responsible for all tools and equipment on their 
assigned apparatus. 
 
Article 12 - SAFETY AND HEALTH 
 
 
A. 
The City and Union shall cooperate in matters of safety, workers

There shall be established a departmental safety committee, a truck committee, an 
equipment committee and other committees as may be mutually agreed upon by 
the parties, each comprised of one private and one officer named by the Union and 
the Chief or designee.  The committee shall meet as necessary and will keep 
minutes of all proceedings.  A copy of the minutes and any reports issued by the 
committee shall be posted at each station, and a copy forwarded to the Fire 
Commission and the Union. There shall be compensation paid for attendance at 
committee meetings by members of the bargaining unit unless they are on duty. 
 
 
7 
 
 
B. 
No employee shall be required to ride the rear of a hose wagon alone 
except when a second employee is on emergency leave as specified in Article 15 or 
24, or has called in sick under Article 22 unless the second employee is responding 
to the same incident in another vehicle.  The first employee will then ride alone 
only until the second employee returns or his or her substitute arrives as specified 
under Article 15 or 24. 
 
 
C. 
The Department will first respond to each incident other than a brush 
fire with an engine/aerial having not less than an officer, a driver and two fire 
fighters.  In the event of response by additional personnel, not less than two fire 
fighters and one officer shall be assigned to each hose line.  Under normal 
operating conditions, any apparatus in active operation at a fire scene shall have an 
operator.  The only exceptions to the foregoing shall be as follows: 
 
1. 
When one member of the group responding is engaged in first 
responder duties. 
 
2. 
When an officer is engaged in group training with other officers.  In 
that event an officer shall respond to a structure fire at the same time as the 
first dispatch via separate vehicle. 
 
3. 
When an employee is on emergency leave as specified in Article 15 or 
24 or has called in sick under Article 22.  In that event, less than the above 
numbers of personnel will respond only until the absent employee on 
emergency leave returns or his or her substitute arrives as specified under 
Article 15 or 24. 
 
4. 
When an employee becomes unable to perform his/her duties due to 
illness or injury and leaves work after 0800 hours on the day shift or after 
1800 hours on the night shift.  Under no circumstances, however, will this 
subparagraph result in more than one unfilled slot on a shift. 
 
5. 
When a member is responding with another vehicle. 
 
6. 
During EMS training there will be no more than 3 companies out of 
service or 2 companies out of service and one company short one person 
(every effort possible will be made to place as many members as possible on 
a single piece of apparatus for the purpose of placing it out of service for 
training). 
 
 
8 
 
 
D. 
The minimum number of fire suppression personnel on duty on any 
given shift will be based on the following formula for each piece of fire apparatus 
designated by the Commission as being in service for that duty shift. 
 
 
1. 
Total number of engines times four personnel. 
 
 
2. 
Total number of aerials times four personnel. 
 
3. 
Shift Management Technician.  Position to be filled during the 2015 
fiscal year. 
 
The total number of personnel designated by the above formula shall be 
temporarily reduced by any personnel absent as set out in Paragraph C, 
subparagraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 above.  The designation of the above formula for 
safety purposes shall not operate as a restriction on the stations or pieces of 
apparatus to which individual personnel may be assigned.  The Fire Commission 
will designate in writing which pieces of apparatus are to be in service at each 
station for each duty shift.  Ten (10) days’ notice will be given in writing prior to 
any change in designation which results in a piece of apparatus being taken out of 
service for seven (7) days or less.  Twenty-one (21) days’ notice will be given in 
writing prior to any change in designation which results in a piece of apparatus 
being taken out of service for any period in excess of seven (7) days. 
 
Specialty vehicles are any vehicles which are operational but not in service 
on a full time status, or manned.  Examples could be CFR 1, Utility, Forestry, 
spare apparatus (engines or ladders), Command van, etc.  Specialty vehicles are 
subject to the provisions of Article 12, Paragraph C.5. 
 
 
E. 
There shall also be provisions for proper working facilities, 
equipment, tools, safety devices, protective clothing and other modern implements 
of fire rescue services so as to provide the City with an efficient and safety-minded 
fire fighting organization to give the City full protection within the limits of the 
annual budget as passed by the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen. 
 
 
F. 
After the four Dispatch Supervisors are hired, there shall be no less 
than three Fire Dispatchers or Dispatch Supervisors on duty at all times, with the 
exception of time taken under Article 15, F.  If a third Fire Dispatcher or Dispatch 
Supervisor is needed, every effort will be made to call in a third Fire Dispatcher or 
Dispatch Supervisor from the remaining pool of Fire Dispatchers and Dispatch 
 
 
9 
Supervisors.  If unable to secure replacement from off duty Fire Dispatchers and 
Dispatch Supervisors, the dispatch center will operate with the remaining two 
members for the remainder of the shift.  This language only applies if a member 
must leave after their shift has begun. 
 
 
F.1. If three Fire Dispatchers are working on a shift, the most senior of the

Article 15 - OVERTIME 
 
A. 
When a Fire Officer or Fire Private is called back to work shift

to the overtime rate until that member has worked his/her regularly schedule work 
week hours in the seven (7) day established cycle plus an additional five (5) hours 
at the regular straight time rate if section F applies and four (4) hours if section F is 
not applicable.  (For example, a member assigned to work a thirty-eight (38) hour 
work week would not receive overtime for shift coverage until that member had 
worked forty-three (43) hours if section F is applicable and forty-two (42) hours if 
section F is not applicable during that seven (7) day established cycle.)  For the 
purpose of determining whether a member is entitled to overtime during any seven 
(7) day established cycle, hours not worked due to sickness, vacation or paid leave, 
will not count towards the regularly scheduled work week hours. 
 
B. 
When a Fire Officer or Fire Private is held over beyond the end of the 
regular work shift (day/night) he/she shall be paid time and one half for all hours 
worked with a one hour minimum pay rule. 
 
 
C. 
For Fire Officers and Fire Privates - in the event that an emergency 
need for overtime work occurs, other than shift coverage and training classes, as 
reasonably determined by the Chief, overtime in excess of regular scheduled hours 
of duty shall be paid at time and one-half the basic rate, with a two (2) hour 
minimum pay rule.

for the hours actually worked, with a two-hour (2) minimum pay rule. 
 
 
E. 
Fire Dispatchers and Dispatch Supervisors shall be paid time and one-
half (1 1/2) the basic rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per 
weekly pay period.  For the purpose of determining whether a member is entitled 
 
 
15 
to overtime during a weekly pay period, hours not worked due to sickness, 
vacation or paid leave will not count towards the regularly scheduled work week 
hours. 
 
 
F. 
An employee upon being notified to work overtime after working a 
full duty shift when no emergency is involved will be given one (1) hour leave 
with pay to attend to personal business.  The one (1) hour leave will be given at 
such time as to permit the purchase of food during supermarket store hours, prior 
to the meal for which the food is to be used.  The hour of leave will be given at a 
time set at the discretion of the Chief or designee. 
 
 
G. 
If an employee is notified to work shift coverage/overtime for both the 
day and night shift on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day, he will be given three 
(3) hours consecutively to attend to personal business.  This time will include the 
time allotted in paragraph F above. 
 
 
H. 
The Union shall establish by platoon for Fire Officers and Fire 
Privates two (2) overtime lists of those employees who hold permanent positions 
defined under Article 12, Paragraph D, who wish to be offered the opportunity to 
serve overtime on a voluntary basis.  The first list for each category shall be for 
day shift overtime opportunities and the second list shall be night shift overtime 
opportunities.  Overtime shall be first offered to those employees whose names are 
on the voluntary overtime list and who are qualified to serve the overtime in the 
opinion of the Chief or designee.  The offers shall be made on a rotating basis on 
each of the appropriate lists, and employees who decline overtime when first 
offered shall obtain a suitable replacement subject to the approval of the Chief or 
designee.  No employee shall be permitted to start a shift of shift coverage 
overtime, if that employee has worked more than seventy-six (76) hours in that  
payroll week, except under conditions in B above.  Employees who are absent shall 
lose their place in the rotation for the period that they are absent except when on 
vacation, bereavement leave, while involved in paid department training, on 
military leave of a month or less, or Union business.  Union business will include 
personal leave that is taken for that reason.  Additionally, an employee, who is 
scheduled on Union business and is unable to work his/her overtime because of it, 
will not lose their place in the rotation. 
 
The Union shall keep current and post the voluntary overtime list every 
twelve months providing that employees may be added or deleted as needed by 
reason of transfer, new hires, promotions or like conditions.  Upon being furnished 
the voluntary overtime list prior to posting, the department will furnish the Union 
 
 
16 
with all employee telephone numbers unless an employee has refused permission 
for the release of the number.  In the event of refusal, the Union shall be so advised 
and shall then be responsible for the obtaining of the telephone number.  All 
employees shall be given the opportunity to work overtime on a voluntary basis 
after they have satisfactorily completed 120 days of employment in accordance 
with this subsection F. 
 
 
I. 
All employees agree to work overtime at the request of the Chief or 
designee.  If an employee is unable to work the assigned overtime, the employee to 
whom the overtime is assigned will obtain a suitable replacement and will be 
allowed to use City telephones to make such arrangements.  All replacements are 
subject to the approval of the Chief or designee. 
 
 
J. 
Upon request, the City will make available the involuntary overtime 
assignment list.  All involuntary overtime shall be rotated on an equitable basis. 
The rotation list for involuntary overtime shall be kept current, posted and reposted 
by the City after every transfer. 
 
 
K. 
Positions required by Article 12, Paragraph D, shall be designated as 
permanent positions. If one of these positions is vacant as a result of sickness, 
injury, vacation, or bereavement leave or leave provided for under paragraph 7B, 
that absence will constitute a temporary opening due to absence. The Department 
will cover temporary openings due to absence in accordance with the provisions of 
Paragraphs L through M below. Additional employees above those required to fill 
permanent positions defined in Article 12, Paragraph D shall not be used to cover 
temporary openings due to absence, and the absence of such employees for any 
reason, will create a temporary opening under this Article. 
 
 
L. 
When a temporary opening occurs in the Permanent Fire Officer ranks 
due to absence, a Permanent Fire Officer shall be used to cover the opening.  In the 
event the Department uses an employee to cover any opening created by the use of 
the latter Permanent Fire Officer, that opening shall be offered to a Permanent Fire 
Officer on the voluntary overtime list under Paragraph F above.  When any 
additional opening occurs in the Permanent Fire Officer ranks, that opening may be 
offered to an Acting Fire Officer or a Permanent Fire Officer on the voluntary 
overtime list under Paragraph F above.  In the event no Fire Officer on the list 
under Paragraph F above fills a temporary opening created by a Permanent Fire 
Officer absence, any Permanent or Acting Officer may be required to work 
overtime.  Any Permanent or Acting Officer required to work overtime may, at the  
employee's option, allow a Permanent Fire Officer or Acting Fire Officer to work 
 
 
17 
the overtime, provided that the Permanent Fire Officer or Acting Fire Officer is 
qualified in the opinion of the Chief or designee.  All coverage of openings under 
this paragraph shall be paid in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph A. The above 
should not be construed as to prohibit the Officer in Charge from assigning the 
replacement Fire Officers to work specific work areas. 
 
 
M. 
When a temporary opening occurs in the Permanent Fire Private ranks 
due to absence, the following shall apply: 
 
1. 
All temporary openings due to absence shall be offered to 
Permanent Fire Privates on the voluntary overtime list under Paragraph E 
above to be paid in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph A. 
 
2. 
If an overtime opportunity to fill a temporary opening is not 
filled by a Permanent Fire Private whose name is on the overtime list under 
Paragraph E, any Fire Private may be required to cover the opening shall be 
paid in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph A. Any Fire Private required 
to work overtime may, at the employee's option, allow another Fire Private 
to work the overtime provided that Fire Private is qualified in the opinion of 
the Chief or designee. The above should not be construed as to prohibit the 
Officer in Charge from assigning the replacement Fire Privates to work 
specific work areas. 
 
 
N. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs A through L above, in 
the event the Commission takes one or more pieces of apparatus out of service by 
reason of operational requirements, and there are either temporary or permanent 
reductions in staffing because of that Commission action, those employees affected 
by the temporary or permanent reductions shall be assigned to fill permanent 
vacancies for which they are qualified, and the first opportunity to cover temporary 
vacancies for which they are qualified on a straight time basis before the temporary 
vacancy coverage is made on an overtime basis. The Department will give the 
Union notice in accordance with Article 12, Paragraph D, prior to taking one or 
more pieces of apparatus out of service, except for normal maintenance and 
repairs. 
 
 
O. 
In the event that an employee is injured or becomes ill while working 
overtime and is not able to return to work, the injured or ill employee shall receive 
all benefits provided in Article 22 (Paid Sick and Injury Leave). In the event that 
an employee is replacing another employee or is working regular overtime, and 
 
 
18 
becomes ill from a non-work-related cause, he/she will be paid for the hours of 
overtime hired and the hours not worked shall be deducted from his/her sick leave. 
 
 
P. 
Certain Overtime Callback Procedures. 
 
1. 
Emergency Overtime – In the event that an emergency need 
(multiple alarm, etc.) for overtime work occurs, Fire Alarm will notify those 
members who live out of the immediate area last, the immediate area is 
defined in Article 37, Section B.  Members after being notified of the 
emergency shall respond to the emergency within one hour of being notified 
or the member will be considered as not having reported for duty and, 
therefore, no compensation will be due.  However, if such a member is 
assigned duties by the Chief or designee upon his/her late arrival, the 
member will be compensated commencing at the time such duties are 
assigned. 
 
2. 
Voluntary Overtime 
 
a. 
Those members on the overtime list who live out of the 
Nashua area would be called. 
 
b. 
Each member, after being notified that s/he has overtime 
and at which station, shall fill the vacancy within one hour of being 
notified. 
 
c. 
If the person contacted is unable to fill the vacancy 
within the hour s/he shall make arrangements so that the vacancy shall 
be filled within the hour. 
 
d. 
In order to provide for the most efficient replacement of 
personnel in the event of a vacancy, the Department and Union may 
agree to a modified method for notifying personnel on the voluntary 
overtime list. 
 
3. 
Detail Overtime List 
 
The Fire Department shall establish a rotating list in order to provide 
for the equal distribution of assignments within this detail classification.  
Qualified members who agree to work the detail will be paid one and one 
half times their regular rate of pay with a (2) two-hour minimum pay rule. 
 
 
19 
 
Detail lists will be comprised of members who volunteer to be on the 
lists and shall rotate with senior members placed at the top of the list.  Detail 
lists will not be used to cover vacation or sick leave vacancies, unless agree 
to by the Department and Union.  Detail lists will be posted each January for 
a period of fifteen (15) days to allow members to join or exit the list. 
 
Work that is specific to a division or classification and requires 
specific training or certification: 
 
This detail work opportunity will be offered to individuals in the 
division or classification. If it is determined by agreement of the Department 
and Union that a genuine need for additional, trained, members to fill 
temporary vacancies or detail work opportunities exists, then, a list of 
prerequisites/training a member needs to attain in order to be placed on a 
covering detail list will be agreed upon by the Department and Union.  
Detail or overtime opportunities may then be offered to members on this 
Specifically Trained Detail List, with due regard to seniority, only after all 
members in the division or classification that normally cover the opportunity 
are given the chance to fill the need for all members are unable to work due 
to too many hours already worked in the pay week. In the event that a detail 
or temporary vacancy exists and must be filled and all members of the detail 
list are not interested, the responsibility to fill this need will always be 
relayed to the normal covering division or classification regardless of hours 
work, (examples of work that will be pertinent to this paragraph will include, 
but not be limited to: dispatcher coverage during hardship periods, certified 
instructor work, inspections, line work, mechanic work). 
 
4. 
Administrative Overtime 
 
Members who are requested to attend administrative or committee 
meetings outside of their normal scheduled work hours shall be compensated 
one and one-half (1 1/2) times their hourly rate with a one hour minimum. 
No physical labor is to be performed by attendees on administrative 
overtime. Work details or activities requiring labor by any attendee are not 
considered administrative overtime. 
 
 
 
 
 
20 
Article 16 – SENIORITY 
 
 
A. 
Seniority shall be determined to be the period of uninterrupted 
employment with the Nashua Fire Department and Nashua Fire Rescue since the 
last date of employment.  The City shall establish a seniority list, and it shall be 
brought up to date each year during the month of November and posted on all fire 
station bulletin boards for a period of not less than thirty (30) days, and a copy 
mailed to the Secretary of the Union. Any objection to the seniority list as posted 
shall be reported within thirty (30) days of the end of the posting period by the 
individual employee. Seniority will commence from the first day of employment 
on a full-time basis as a probationary employee. Corrections to the seniority list 
brought to the City's attention after the thirty (30) day period will be corrected, but 
would not negate any benefits already awarded based on seniority. 
 
 
B. 
In the event of more than one employee being hired simultaneously, 
after July 1, 1989, the order of seniority will be determined by the dates that the 
Department received the application from the employee. If date of hire and the date 
the application is received are the same, employee seniority will be determined 
alphabetically by last name. 
 
 
C. 
All newly hired employees shall serve a probationary period of nine 
(9) months or complete Career Fire Fighter certification, whichever comes later, 
and shall have no rights based on seniority during this period. They shall, however, 
insofar as applicable, be subject to all other clauses in this Agreement with the 
exception of the use of the grievance procedure for termination or discipline 
reasons. All employees who have completed said nine (9) months of service or 
Career Fire Fighter certification, whichever comes later, shall be known as 
permanent employees and the probationary period shall be credited as part of the 
employee's seniority. The City agrees to provide training for certification as Career 
Fire Fighter at its expense in accordance with State law. In the event the employee 
is absent by reason of illness or injury, the Department may, at its discretion, 
extend the probationary period by the amount of time absent over seven (7) duty 
shifts during that nine (9) month probationary period, up to three (3) additional 
months. 
 
 
D. 
In addition to the bargaining unit seniority list, Nashua Fire Rescue 
shall establish a time in rank seniority list for each division.  Time in rank in any 
division shall commence on the first day at work in that division and end when the 
employee leaves the division for any reason. 
 
 
 
21 
Article 17 - PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS AND RECALL  
 
 
A. 
In the case of a reduction of personnel within the bargaining unit, the 
employee with the least seniority shall be laid off first.  In the event an employee 
must be involuntary demoted as a result of a reduction of personnel, such demotion 
shall be accomplished in accordance with the time in ranks seniority list for the 
division and the employee with the least seniority shall be demoted first. 
 
 
B. 
The names of employees laid off from the bargaining unit will be 
maintained on a recall list for two years from the date of layoff and such 
employees will be offered recall in the order of greatest seniority if vacancies occur 
in their job classifications. If a laid off employee is notified by telephone or by a 
letter sent to his/her last known address on the records of the Fire Department to 
return to work, he/she must notify the Department within two (2) days of his/her 
intentions to comply or accept and must report to work within ten (10) days of such 
notification or he/she shall cease to have any rights based on seniority and shall be 
terminated. Recalled employees who return to work will be credited with prior 
length of service, provided such employee has not withdrawn his/her contributions 
from the State Retirement System. 
 
 
C. 
If a driver's job is totally eliminated or is not covered on a 24-hour 
basis, any driver affected shall be given the opportunity to fill another full-time 
driver's job of his or her choice on the basis of seniority, unless he or she is shown 
not to be qualified. In the event of reassignment, the driver shall be obligated to 
complete only the remaining portion of his/her driver probationary period not 
completed at the time of reassignment. 
 
 
D. 
Any employee demoted as the result of a reduction of personnel 
which is involuntary and non-disciplinary will be maintained on a list.  Employees 
who are on the demotion list shall be reassigned to fill any vacancies that may 
occur in the division from which they were demoted in according with the 
demotion list and time in ranks seniority list for the division. 
 
Article 18 - APPOINTMENTS, PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS 
 
 
A. 
The State of New Hampshire Fire Service Training Division or an 
equivalent organization agreed upon in writing by the City and the Union shall 
conduct and supervise written examinations for available promotions within the 
Nashua Fire Department which are specified below and which specify a 
requirement for such examination. 
 
 
22 
 
 
B. 
The Testing Agency shall submit to the Board of Fire Commissioners 
the names of the candidates who pass the written examinations for each available 
promotional opportunity. 
 
 
C. 
All promotions to classifications in the bargaining unit and to the 
Deputy Chief and Deputy Chief-Training classification out of the unit shall be 
made from the ranks in accordance with the procedures set forth under this 
Paragraph C, and in Paragraphs D through N below, unless those from the ranks 
are shown not to be qualified. Qualifications, in part, for the rank of Lieutenant, 
Acting Lieutenant, Fire Alarm Lineman, Inspector/Public Education Officer, 
Assistant Superintendent, Inspector/Investigator, Fire Marshall, Superintendent, 
Captain, Deputy Chief and Deputy Chief Training shall be determined by a written 
examination conducted by the Testing Agency. A passing mark of seventy percent 
(70%) must be attained.  Years of service on the Nashua Fire Department will add 
one (1) point for each year of service in-grade to the passing written examination 
mark.  However, if all members can test for a position, one (1) point for each year 
of service in the Nashua Fire Department will be added to the passing written 
examination mark.  A passing written examination mark of seventy percent (70%) 
must be attained before such seniority points are added. Seniority points shall be 
calculated based on the effective date of the test results, and shall be recalculated

a maximum accrual of seven hundred twenty (720) hours allowed. Sick leave does 
not accrue during disciplinary suspension.  Sick leave taken shall be charged 
against hours accumulated on the basis of the actual number of hours the employee 
is absent during scheduled duty hours. Effective upon signing of this Agreement, 
sick leave will no longer have a maximum accrual of seven hundred twenty (720) 
hours.  However, payment of sick leave upon retirement or death as described in

B. 
In the event of a prolonged absence because of illness in excess of 
thirty (30) calendar days, sick leave accumulation will be allowed only for the first 
thirty (30) days of such an absence.  There will be no accumulation of sick leave 
during absences covered by the Sick Bank. 
 
 
C. 
Sick leave will be used only for the personal injury or illness of the 
employees, not contracted in the line of duty, provided such sickness or injury is 
not incurred as the result of day-off work in which case no sick leave will be paid. 
In the case of sickness or injury incurred as the result of working for another 
employer, the employee shall receive no sick leave with pay. 
 
 
C.1. An employee may use a maximum of 80.64 hours per year for the care 
of the illness of a family member who resides in the immediate household.  The 
usage of sick leave in this instance may not necessarily be covered by the Family 
Medical Leave Act (FMLA).  Employees utilizing sick leave under this paragraph 
who are unable to perform their duties for more than two (2) consecutive duty 
shifts shall furnish to the Chief of the Department a certificate from a physician 
 
 
39 
stating that the nature of the family member’s illness required the employee’s 
absence from work.

criteria set forth in the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 may use all of his/her 
accrued sick leave while on FMLA. 
 
 
D. 
Any employee not able to report to work because of illness must 
notify the Deputy Chief on duty at least one (1) hour before scheduled to report for 
work. Any member of the Department classified as a Fire Private, Fire Lieutenant

perform their duties because of illness for more than two (2) duty shifts shall 
furnish to the Chief of the Department a certificate from a physician stating the 
nature, cause and extent of the illness and a clearance to return to work. No less 
than twelve (12) hours prior to the return to duty of the members of any grade from 
leaves of absence because of illness shall report such return to the Deputy Chief on 
duty, by telephone or otherwise, who shall report to the Chief of the Department. 
 
 
E. 
If an employee incurs injury on the job, he/she will be sent at once to 
a hospital if in the judgment of his/her immediate supervisor such action is 
required to determine the extent of the injury. The injured employee who is sent to 
a hospital, as provided above, will obtain a certificate from the doctor indicating 
the extent of the injury and the date by which the employee can be expected to be 
able to return to work. This certificate is to be provided to the Deputy Chief or 
Superintendent, depending on work group. 
 
 
F. 
Any member of the Nashua Fire Rescue who is temporarily unable to 
perform his/her duties as the result of personal injury or illness contracted in the 
discharge of his/her duties shall so inform the Nashua Fire Rescue on the day of 
the injury on the required forms or as soon as the employee is aware of the injury 
or illness, and shall also comply with the State's Worker's Compensation Law.

shall be entitled to full pay during such disability under this Paragraph F up to a 
maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks, commencing with the date of injury or illness 
for which worker's compensation benefits are paid. For this purpose, full pay shall 
be computed as follows: the weekly compensation allowance as determined by the 
worker's compensation law plus a weekly allowance paid by the City by means of 
 
 
40 
the Department payroll -- the City's share to be an amount representing the 
difference between a member's regular full weekly salary and the amount paid 
under worker's compensation. With medical certification of continuing total 
disability which is not in conflict with the rulings of the worker's compensation 
specialist, differential pay to the amount of 3/4 of the regular full salary computed 
as specified above shall be continued for up to a maximum of an additional twenty-
six (26) weeks (with a minimum total payment of approved worker's compensation 
payments combined with City differential pay accounting to 3/4 of the maximum 
of such regular full salary applicable to Senior Privates/Senior Dispatchers). Such 
occupational sickness or disability shall not be charged to the accrued sick leave of 
the employee. The payment of the benefits under this Paragraph F shall be so 
administered as to allow the benefited employee(s) the maximum tax relief 
permitted under the United States Internal Revenue Code. 
 
 
G. 
The City shall pay under Workers Compensation coverage, the 
hospital, medical and surgical expenses incurred by any employee who is injured 
in the performance of his/her duties.

K. 
Any member of the bargaining unit may contribute eight (8) hours of 
his/her sick leave to a sick leave bank by July 31 of each contract year. 
Contributing members may apply for withdrawal from the sick leave bank upon 
depletion of accumulated sick leave for reasons of prolonged or continuing illness 
or incapacitating accident. The total amount of accumulations in the bank as of 
July 1, 1983, is agreed to be 7910 hours. Henceforth, the total number of 
accumulated hours in the bank shall not exceed 58 hours times the number of 
eligible members in the bargaining unit. Withdrawals from the bank shall be 
 
 
41 
charged against the total number of hours in the bank on the basis of the number of 
actual hours the employee is absent during scheduled duty hours. The operation of 
the bank and withdrawals therefrom shall be carried out by a committee of two (2) 
members of the bargaining unit, and one (1) administrator selected by the Chief. 
The committee shall establish its rules and regulations and shall require 
documentation from a physician supporting the request for sick leave bank 
withdrawals. The committee shall furnish written records of deposits, withdrawals 
and documentation to the Chief and to the City Human Resource Department. 
Records of deposits shall be furnished no later than August 30th of each year. In all 
cases, the decisions rendered by the committee shall be final and binding,

shall be mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Chief of the Department, 
consistent with the physician’s work restrictions.  An injured employee who is 
judged to have a light work capacity by his/her treating physician may be given a 
light duty assignment consistent with Fire Department functions, the employee’s 
physical capabilities and any limitations imposed by the treating physician.  The 
Department may promulgate policies and procedures from time to time in order to 
update and improve this program.  Light duty assignments shall be temporary, and 
will be calculated to facilitate the employee’s recovery and resumption of his/her 
normal duties.  Participants shall receive the difference between their Worker’s 
Compensation benefits and any wages received, and their regular full pay while 
serving in this light duty capacity.

performed by the Fire Department based upon its records. 
 
 
4. 
This benefit shall cease for any calendar year in the event that 
total department sick leave use exceeds eleven thousand five hundred 
(11,500) hours in that year. In the event that total department sick leave use 
is less than eight thousand (8,000) hours in any year, the benefit described in 
Paragraph M.1 above shall increase as follows: 
 
 
No sick time used in the calendar year - seventy-five percent 
(75%) of one week's pay; 
 
 
Fifteen (15) hours or less of sick leave used in the calendar year 
- sixty percent (60%) of one week's pay; 
 
Thirty hours or less of sick leave used in the calendar year - 
fifty percent (50%) of one week's pay; 
 
Forty-eight (48) hours or less of sick leave used in the calendar 
year - forty percent (40%) of one week's pay. 
 
In computing total departmental sick time use for purposes of determining whether 
the enhanced benefits in this subparagraph will be paid in the calendar year in 
question, all departmental sick time used will be included, except that the 
consecutive hours used by an individual employee on account of a single injury or 
illness which exceed 420 consecutive hours for that injury or illness will not be 
included. The 420 hour maximum shall be included in the computation.
