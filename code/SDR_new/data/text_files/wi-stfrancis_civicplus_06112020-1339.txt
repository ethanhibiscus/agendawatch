Honorable Board of Public Works 
City of St. Francis 
Subject:  Permit for Tesinc LLC Fiber Installation on S. Whitnall Avenue and S. Pennsylvania Avenue 
Gentlepersons: 
The City has received a permit application from Tesinc LLC to install a new section of underground fiber optic 
cable in S. Whitnall Avenue from S. Clement Avenue to S. Pennsylvania Avenue and in S. Pennsylvania Avenue 
from S. Whitnall Avenue to E. Layton Avenue and into the City of Cudahy.  This is a new utility to the City and 
any new installation requires a review by the Board of Public Works.  Our comments are as follows: 
1. All bore holes in pavement (sidewalk or street) will require full slab replacement.  Bore holes in asphalt 
will require a 5’x5’ minimum replacement unless otherwise marked by the City.
2. Are the bore pits in the same locations as the hand holes?  If not, please show the locations of the bore 
pits on the plans. 
Update – All hand holes are bore pits.  If there are any in addition to the hand holes currently shown, 
they will be added.
3. There were plans, many years ago, to install signals at Brust and Whitnall.  While the signals were not 
installed, the infrastructure was.  Attached are the plans for this infrastructure.  Please show it on the 
plans. 
4. The connections from the storm catch basins to the storm sewer main need to be shown in the areas 
where the bore is crossing them.  The plans for the storm sewer are also attached. 
5. It appears that you are aware that the project encroaches into WisDOT right-of-way and Milwaukee 
County right-of-way.  The plans do not show contact information for the railroad that is being crossed as 
part of this project. The railroad tracks are on a separate parcel of land owned by UP Railroad.  You will 
need their permission to cross their infrastructure.   
 
Update – Permits from WisDOT, Milwaukee County and UP Railroad have all been applied for. 
6. There may be a gas pipeline and/or a large sanitary sewer owned by Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage 
District in the project area on either or both sides of the Whitnall Avenue bridge.  You will need to 
reach out to them to get their infrastructure information. 
7. Also, them may be additional We Energies electric infrastructure on the east side of the Whitnall 
Avenue bridge.  Please verify. 
8. The proposed open cut in the easterly driveway approach to the multi-tenant building on Layton and 
Pennsylvania should be reconsidered.  This access is heavily used by the patrons to these businesses and 
the City has had complaints about access to this site in the past.

While these items are important, they are common comments and can be reviewed and approved by staff.  I 
therefore recommend that the permit be approved contingent upon all review items being addressed and approved 
by City staff. 
Respectfully submitted,

RESOLUTION NO. ________ 
RESOLUTION TO FINDING 
WHEREAS, the existing storm sewer under East Crawford Avenue between South Brook 
Place and South Vermont Avenue has collapsed resulting in approximately 80% of its 
capacity being blocked; and 
WHEREAS, the collapse of said storm sewer pipe has resulted in the sudden development 
of a sinkhole in the terrace on East Crawford Avenue that is undermining the adjacent 
public sidewalk; and 
WHEREAS, the Highway Department has erected barricades within the area and placed a 
metal plate over the existing sinkhole to provide short-term protection of the public; and 
WHEREAS, the continued flow of storm water into the collapsed storm sewer will likely 
result in expansion of the existing sink hole and further undermining and/or collapse of the 
adjacent public way(s); 
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Public Works finds 
that, as a result of the damage to the storm sewer under East Crawford Avenue between 
South Brook Place and South Vermont Avenue, the sudden development of a sinkhole, and 
the resulting threatened damage to the public right of way and pedestrians and vehicular 
traffic due to the continued flow of storm water, there now exists an emergency for 
purposes of Section 62.15(1b) of the Wisconsin Statues in which the public health or 
welfare of the City is endangered.   
Dated this ____ day of June 2020.

___________________, Board Secretary 
To the Board of Public Works,
I’m the Youth Services Librarian at the St. Francis Public Library, and I’m requesting approval to create a
StoryWalk on the Nojoshing Trail.
A StoryWalk is a book (generally a children's picture book) that is taken apart and posted page by page
throughout a trail. It's a great way of incorporating literacy with exercise and is a fun family-bonding
activity. My goal of the StoryWalk is to combine a love of books with exercise and nature. St. Francis has
a lot of great green spaces, and I believe the addition of a StoryWalk will only seek to highlight just one of
these places. Besides a couple of supplies that I’m hoping to borrow from DPW, I will be funding the
entire project.
To create this StoryWalk, I need to construct roughly 20 stands that would be spaced out next to the
paved part of Nojoshing Trail (Picture 1). The starting location will be the Civic Center entrance just
behind the Nojoshing Trail sign (Picture 2) and would wrap around the first part of the paved trail (Picture
3) back to the entrance (Picture 4). The stands would have a page from a chosen story displayed on a
plywood board and will include activity prompts. The stand for a StoryWalk can vary from cheap to
expensive, from temporary to a permanent structure. For the initial creation, I want to create a short-term
installation that does not cost a lot but has a sound structure that can withstand the elements for roughly a
month and a half: July 1 through August 15, 2020. The materials used to create each stand include the
following: laminated pages from the book of choice, T-Posts, U-Brackets, and plywood. These materials
are often used for snow fencing and will be a durable and affordable option. A stake pounder and stake
puller will be used to install and remove the stands. Although I will create and install the stands, I would
appreciate DPW providing me the stake pounder and stake puller.  However, I can find these materials if
not offered. The height of each stand will come to 4 feet. The stands will be installed roughly a foot into
the ground next to the paved trail. I will create the stands ahead of installation time and will be responsible
for maintaining them. A similar example of the structure is included in this document (Picture 4). The
stands will be light enough that I can transport them to the trail and remove them when the project has
finished.
After the first StoryWalk, I would love to continue offering them in this community whether in the same
location, a different Nojoshing trail, or another green space in St. Francis. This project can continue to be
re-installed and offered in other months/seasons but with a different story. I’m open to suggestions on the
best places to install the stands and thoughts on where they should go. I believe the first StoryWalk
should be located in the pathed area behind the Civic Center because of the access to a large parking lot
for vehicles. Plus, the paved trail can withstand the elements better than the woodland or gravel and
wood chip trail. If the City feels strongly enough, we could work in the future on creating a permanent
structure (Picture 6). More information about the origin of the StoryWalk can be found at
https://letsmovelibraries.org/storywalk/.
Thank you,
Jessica Norris
