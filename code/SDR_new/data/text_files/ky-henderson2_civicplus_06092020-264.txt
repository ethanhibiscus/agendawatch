Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) Application to Department for 
Local Government - Reimbursement COVID-19 Related Expenses 
The accompanying resolution authorizes the submittal of a Coronavirus Relief Fund 
application to the Department for Local Government for reimbursement of COVID-19 
related expenses. 
Kentucky received funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act 
(CARES Act) and $300,000,000.00 of those reimbursement funds have been pledged to 
city and county governments across the Commonwealth to help with the additional 
expenses incurred due to the public health emergency. The city of Henderson is eligible 
for up to $2,044,443.00 based on the population formula used to allocate those funds. 
Eligible expenditures may only be used to cover costs that are incurred due to the 
COVID-19 public health emergency; were not accounted for in the budget most recently 
approved as of March 27, 2020; and incurred during the period that began on March 1, 
2020 and ends on December 30, 2020. Further clarification on eligible payroll expenses 
for safety, medical or public health needs expenditures, improvements necessary for 
public employees to telework to comply with public health precautions, expenses for 
disinfection of public spaces and facilities, and economic support to those suffering from 
employment or business interruptions due to COVID-19 related business closures is 
expected within the next few weeks. 
Reimbursement requests may be submitted any time after the authorizing resolution has 
been adopted and then monthly or quarterly thereafter. Your approval of the attached 
resolution is requested.

Kentucky is in the midst of a slow reopening, and I hope you are seeing things begin to improve in your 
city. The COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on our communities, from the physical and mental well-being of 
our citizens to the financial viability of businesses and governments. Many revenue-limited cities are 
struggling to recover, and financial aid is desperately needed. We are continuing to champion for 
revenue replacement with Kentucky's federal delegation, and we appreciate the advocacy you have also 
undertaken on this issue. 
An agreement reached with Governor Andy Beshear will help with recovering some of the eligible 
expenses cities have incurred due to the pandemic. The governor is apportioning $300 million of the 
state's Coronavirus Relief Fund allocation for local government reimbursements. The maximum amount 
your city could receive is $2,044,443. We are appreciative ofthe governor's willingness to work with us 
to secure this funding and for ensuring Kentucky's reimbursement requirements match those 
established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
Cities can seek compensation of COVID-related costs such as the purchase of personal protective 
equipment {PPE) and other medical and protective supplies, costs of COVID-19 testing, emergency 
medical response expenses, amounts spent on communication and enforcement of public health orders, 
costs of disinfecting public areas, and payroll expenses for public safety and health employees who have 
been dedicated to responding to the pandemic. I have attached Treasury guidelines on what is and is 
not allowed. Expenses must be incurred between March 1 and December 30, 2020, and they must not 
have been budgeted for as of March 27. To receive reimbursement, you will need to apply at the 
Kentucky Department for Local Government (DLG) website, kydlgweb.ky.gov, and submit 
documentation. 
Thank you for the leadership you are providing at the local level during these extreme times. We 
appreciate your commitment to your city, and we are proud to represent you in Frankfort and at the 
nation's Capital. Please let me know if 
you have any questions on the reimbursement opportunity or our 
efforts to secure direct federal aid. 
Sincerely, 
J.D. Chaney

Coronavirus Relief Fund 
Guidance for State, Territorial, Local, and Tribal Governments 
April 22, 2020 
The purpose of 
this document is to provide guidance to recipients of 
the funding available under section 
60l(a) of 
the Social Security Act, as added by section 5001 of 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act ("CARES Act"). The CARES Act established the Coronavirus Relief Fund (the "Fund") 
and appropriated $150 billion to the Fund. Under the CARES Act, the Fund is to be used to make 
payments for specified uses to States and certain local governments; the District of 
Columbia and U.S. 
Territories (consisting of 
the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands); and Tribal governments. 
The CARES Act provides that payments from the Fund may only be used to cover costs that-
1. are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to 
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); 
2. were not accounted for in the budget most recently approved as of 
March 27, 2020 (the 
date of enactment of the CARES Act) for the State or government; and 
3. were incurred during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 
2020. 1 
The guidance that follows sets forth the Department of 
the Treasury's interpretation of 
these limitations 
on the permissible use of 
Fund payments. 
Necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency 
The requirement that expenditures be incurred "due to" the public health emergency means that 
expenditures must be used for actions taken to respond to the public health emergency. These may 
include expenditures incurred to allow the State, territorial, local, or Tribal government to respond 
directly to the emergency, such as by addressing medical or public health needs, as well as expenditures 
incurred to respond to second-order effects of 
the emergency, such as by providing economic support to 
those suffering from employment or business interruptions due to COVID-19-related business closures. 
Funds may not be used to fill shortfalls in government revenue to cover expenditures that would not 
otherwise qualify under the statute. Although a broad range of 
uses is allowed, revenue replacement is 
not a permissible use of 
Fund payments. 
The statute also specifies that expenditures using Fund payments must be "necessary." The Department 
of 
the Treasury understands this term broadly to mean that the expenditure is reasonably necessary for its 
intended use in the reasonable judgment of 
the government officials responsible for spending Fund 
payments. 
Costs not accounted/or in the budget most recently approved as of 
March 27, 2020 
The CARES Act also requires that payments be used only to cover costs that were not accounted for in 
the budget most recently approved as of 
March 27, 2020. A cost meets this requirement if 
either (a) the 
cost cannot lawfully be funded using a line item, allotment, or allocation within that budget or (b) the cost 
1 See Section 60I(d) of 
the Social Security Act, as added by section 5001 of 
the CARES Act. 
is for a substantially different use from any expected use of 
funds in such a line item, allotment, or 
allocation. 
The "most recently approved" budget refers to the enacted budget for the relevant fiscal period for the 
particular government, without taking into account subsequent supplemental appropriations enacted or 
other budgetary adjustments made by that government in response to the COVID-19 public health 
emergency. A cost is not considered to have been accounted for in a budget merely because it could be 
met using a budgetary stabilization fund, rainy day fund, or similar reserve account. 
Costs incurred during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 2020 
A cost is "incurred" when the responsible unit of 
government has expended funds to cover the cost.

• 
Expenditures related to the provision of 
grants to small businesses to reimburse the costs of 
business interruption caused by required closures. 
• 
Expenditures related to a State, territorial, local, or Tribal government payroll support 
program. 
•

mitigating or responding to the COVID-19 public health emergency. 
2 In addition, pursuant to section 500l(b) of 
the CARES Act, payments from the Fund may not be expended for an 
elective abortion or on research in which a human embryo is destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk of 
injury or death. The prohibition on payment for abortions does not apply to an abortion if 
the pregnancy is the result 
of 
an act ofrape or incest; or in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or 
physical illness, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, that 
would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of 
death unless an abortion is performed. 
Furthermore, no government which receives payments from the Fund may discriminate against a health care entity 
on the basis that the entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.

FROM: 
William L. "Buzzy" Newman, Jr., City Manager ~ 
SUBJECT: 
Tax and Revenue Anticipation Note 
Attached is a municipal order renewing the Tax and Revenue Anticipation Note with 
Farmers Bank and Trust. 
As you may recall, in 2018 the City requested proposals for interest rates on a tax and 
revenue anticipation note to be used when the City is low on cash, which usually occurs 
in early fall before property tax collections are received, or for large capital projects that 
could be reimbursed by municipal bonds. 
The interest rate was locked in for three years with the award to Farmers Bank and Trust, 
however, it is necessary to renew the Note on an annual basis to run with our fiscal year. 
Your approval of 
the attached municipal order is requested.

This purchase will include five ( 
5) 2020 Dodge Durango A 
WD Police Pursuit Vehicles at a 
cost of $29,252.00 per vehicle. The vendor anticipates delivery in approximately three to six 
months. Additional equipment and striping estimated at $11,700 per vehicle will require 
separate approval once the vehicles have been delivered. 
Adequate funds are available in the Fiscal Year 2021 budget for this purchase. 
Your 
approval of 
the attached municipal order is requested.

Re: 
2020‐2021 Proposed Budgets – Executive Summary   
Date: 
8 May 2020 
 
Presented here are the Henderson Water Utility 2020‐2021 Operating and Capital Budgets.   We 
will discuss this in appropriate detail and seek your approval at the 18 May 2020 Board Meeting. 
 
General: 
Our conservative budgeting and forecasting over the last several years have served us well. Our 
declining cash position resulted in adjustment to our rate structure thru the implementation of 
fixed charges for water and wastewater customers. These changes generated needed revenue 
and cash flow resulting in an improved cash position.  Current issues including urgent capital 
needs and increased utility and sludge disposal costs, along with the ongoing concerns related to 
pension and benefit costs put additional pressures on budget preparation. These issues resulted 
in an overall budgeted expense over 7% which exceeds our annual goal of 3% or less. 
The Operating Budget includes estimated operating revenues of $23,659,240, which shows an 
increase of approximately 6.5% from last year’s budget. Revenues were budgeted projecting 
static usage from our major contractual customers and factoring the continuing trend of usage 
decrease from non‐contract customers (projected a conservative 4% decline across all customer 
bases). 
Operating expenses are budgeted at $20,839,049, a 7.23% increase when compared to last year’s 
budget. The increase is due primarily to higher projected costs for utilities, maintenance costs, 
and sludge hauling and disposal. 
This budget includes increased capital expenditures to fund critical projects but does not include 
any additional borrowing for these major projects.  Capital expenditures in this budget will be 
paid from cash generated from operations and existing reserves. Both Operating Income and Net 
Position are anticipated to improve, however cash position is budgeted to decrease due to capital 
needs. 
 
 
 
Executive Summary – 2020‐2021 Budget 
Page 2 of 6 
 
Operating Budget: 
 Salaries and wages are based upon the 102 full‐time budgeted positions identified below.  
With  Commissioners,  temporary/seasonal  employees  and  interns,  our  total  budgeted 
complement is 117.  FICA and Medicare are determined by salaries and overtime charged 
at the applicable statutory rates. 
 Life Insurance, Employee Assistance Program, and Cancer Insurance expenses are based 
on the number of eligible employees and rates supplied by the City. 
 Medical Benefits expense is based on the number of eligible employees and the rate per 
employee supplied by the City, projected at a cost of $18,000 per employee and is based 
on experience in the prior fiscal year. 
 Workers Compensation charges are based upon 2019 ‐ 2020 charges to date.  
 Unemployment Insurance expense is based on 2021 projected rates from the City.  
 Retirement Expense is based upon the required contributions of 24.06% of gross wages 
for non‐hazardous duty employees.  This rate is unchanged from last year due to the 
passage of Senate Bill 249, which held the rate steady.  Change in required contribution 
rate moving forward will be capped at 12% annually. 
 The Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Henderson will increase by $50,000 
this year to $500,000 and continue to increase by that amount to a total of $550,000 in 
FY 2021‐2022. 
 Contractual Services is largely made up of miscellaneous consulting services that are not 
associated and charged to specific projects and other general contractual services related 
to maintenance of facilities and properties. 
 
Changes in some items compared to last year’s budget: 
Utilities: We have increased our planned expenditures by approximately 19% compared to last 
year’s budget due to additional costs incurred at the South Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) and 
recent trends of consumption and rates Utility wide.  The additional electric costs from Big Rivers 
of approximately $480,000 were not known until after preparation of the previous budget.  
Sludge Hauling and Disposal:  Based on increases incurred during previous bidding process in the 
fall of 2019, current trends in volumes, and potential for increases in next bidding cycle, we have 
increased this expenditure by approximately 49% from prior year budget levels. 
Repairs to Vehicles, Equipment and Structures:  These numbers tend to vary annually, since 
expenditures depend on what breaks and when, along with normal maintenance of equipment 
and facilities.  Separation into additional subcategories in the prior budget year has provided 
better tracking, as anticipated.  Increased budgeted cost in this fiscal year relates primarily to the 
$108,000 in repairs related to UV bulb replacement at the North Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
Chemicals:  We have increased the chemical budget based on increasing costs along with current 
trends in usage which are variable annually based on water and wastewater conditions. Overall 
increase is budgeted at a modest 4.3% for the upcoming fiscal year. 
Executive Summary – 2020‐2021 Budget 
Page 3 of 6 
 
Administration Fee from City:  In addition to annual increase in PILOT payment, we have also 
been projected with a $30,000 increase to the administration fee we pay the City for services 
provided for utility billing, IT, accounts payable, human resources and safety.  Current fiscal year 
level was $650,000 (actual) with next year projecting to be approximately $680,000.  Prior budget 
included  estimate  of  $670,000  but  actual  cost  was  finalized  at  $620,000  based  on  final  City 
budget  approved  after  Utility’s.    Increase  in  current  fiscal  year  relates  to  City/Utility’s 
restructuring of safety operations. 
 
Personnel: 
Last  year’s  personnel  budget  (after  amendment  during  the  year)  contained  101  full‐time 
classified employees, 5 Water & Sewer Commissioners and 10 interns and seasonal employees, 
for a total of 116 budgeted positions.   
In this year’s budget, we will increase our complement of employees to 102 full‐time equivalents, 
including some unfilled positions.  This equates to 85 full‐time employees at full staff.  This is a 
result of eliminating currently unfilled positions and restructuring in some areas. 
Extra Positions to Allow Promotions:  Over the last few years, we’ve added several slots that allow 
us to test and promote from within, calling these “ghost” positions.   They are summarized in this 
table:

As an example, there are 14 total classified positions listed in the Water Treatment Operator I 
and II classifications; however, there will never be more than 10 of those positions permanently 
filled.  Five Water Treatment Plant Operator I positions exist, allowing us to hire and train new 
operators due to turnover or vacancy; but these positions are only filled when new, untrained 
operators are hired, and as they gain certification and experience, they will test up into the higher 
classification, never expanding our total working complement of 10 water operators.   
Executive Summary – 2020‐2021 Budget 
Page 4 of 6 
 
All of these “ghost” slots taken together overstate our actual full‐time complement by sixteen 
positions, so that the authorized grand total of 102 full‐time positions overall will never actually 
exceed 86 actual employees, excluding our Commissioners, seasonal employees and interns. 
The following briefly discusses some changes to personnel in this Budget: 
Operator Positions: We are adding and subtracting operator positions to adjust the mix of entry 
and experienced operators, but these adjustments do not impact the total number of employees. 
We have three Water Quality Specialist positions in our water and wastewater laboratories.  Last 
year, we attempted to make one of those positions a Water Quality Specialist – Lead, to have a 
leadership position available in this vital area.   This year, we are eliminating that Lead position 
and returning to the previous arrangement. 
Our  Environmental  Compliance  and  Pretreatment  Coordinator  position  has  been  vacant  for 
several months, after the retirement of the incumbent.  We are eliminating that position, and 
instead will add a position titled “Collection System Operator”, which will fulfill the duties of the 
former position, as well as some additional duties on the wastewater side of the business.   This 
is similar to the Distribution Operator position we added a few years ago and concentrates some 
duties within the Collection System under one individual, for better accountability. 
We are adding a position for an additional Project Engineer and attempting to hire a young 
engineering school graduate near the end of this calendar year.  This person will be trained to 
assume duties currently performed by other staff who are nearing retirement. 
In the Systems Operation area, we are adding a position for an additional Locator/Geospatial 
Technician.    With  the  added  emphasis  on  “Call  811  Before  You  Dig”  at  the  State  level,  the 
workload for this function now exceeds the ability of one person to handle.   When workload is 
smaller, adding an additional person will allow us to perform more mapping and GIS‐locating of 
our existing infrastructure, as well as some condition assessments that we have lagged on in the 
past. 
This is a small number of changes compared to recent years.  As far as number of positions, their 
duties, and the coverage we have for vital functions, the Personnel front is relatively stable.  With 
all these changes, including adding the Project Engineer position, our head count is increasing by 
one. 
 
Capital Budget: 
Our Capital Budget for this year includes a total allocation of $4,500,000 for capital projects and 
new equipment.   This represents an increase of $1,000,000 compared to the previous fiscal year 
budget.   This increase was requested due to urgent infrastructure needs and available reserve 
funds.  We have not included detailed descriptions of the items listed as they seem to be self‐
explanatory; details available on request.  Several projects that were budgeted in the 2019‐2020 
fiscal year are being carried over into next year’s budget as incomplete. 
Completion of the North Wastewater Plant (Headworks) project in the last quarter of CY 2016 
was the last piece necessary to complete our Long‐Term Control Plan (LTCP) as amended, as 
Executive Summary – 2020‐2021 Budget 
Page 5 of 6 
 
required under a Consent Judgment with the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  As we completed that 
long process, we were able to terminate that judgment and are released from those obligations. 
Our focus continues on Water System projects, including planning for expansion/renovation at 
the South Water Plant.   We have completed the first four of a series of projects to renovate our 
nine water storage tanks with the Frontier, College, Vine Street, and Green River Road Tank 
projects in recent years, and the Four‐Star Tank is ready to be bid and awarded this spring.  Funds 
for the Four‐Star Tank project are being earmarked in the 2020‐2021 Capital Budget. 
Additional funds for design of the South Water Treatment Plant Raw Water Intake and Pipeline 
are included in this budget.  Design of this large project will be completed near the end of this 
calendar year, with bidding and construction starting in the spring of 2021.  This project is a high 
priority due to greatly increased electric power costs at the current intake on the Big Rivers 
property, due to shut down of portions of the power generators on that site, on which we depend 
for raw water. 
An additional project funded in this year’s budget is the Myrene Drive Force Main, which will 
replace an aging line near the river with a larger line that travels through neighborhoods between 
the Myrene Drive sewer pump station and the Atkinson Park pump station.   Further segments 
of this project will include a new Atkinson Park sewer pump station and replacement of the force 
main from that station, back into the sewer system near the intersection of 14th Street and Adams 
Lane. 
After accepting Proposals, we are working to evaluate an Advance Metering Infrastructure (AMI) 
project that will replace most of our residential water meters over the next few years.   An 
allocation of $600,000 from the new Capital Budget will continue implementation of this system 
into the new fiscal year. 
We are also continuing funding for the Countryview Subdivision stormwater projects that are 
being constructed as a joint venture with the City.  We have committed to continued joint funding 
of this project in segments as funds become available and have worked with the City and a 
consultant on final design of several more sections, moving street by street to address long‐
standing drainage issues. 
In the Capital Budget section, $2,353,000 is being allocated to ongoing projects, $300,000 is being 
dedicated to new projects in the coming year, leaving $1,847,000 in unobligated funds for various 
projects in our Strategic Plan.   You have received a copy of our updated Capital Improvement 
Program and Strategic Plan separately, which outlines our plans in the short and long terms for 
capital construction.  This plan was first produced in 2014, and we’ll continue to revise this 
blueprint yearly at about this time, to better tailor our budgeted capital expenditures to the 
needs identified in the plan, and to provide justification for our capital spending priorities. 
We will replace a few vehicles as the year progresses but will keep these expenditures to a 
minimum since funding is so tight.  This is necessary to keep us on an even keel, as we rely heavily 
on our fleet to provide the services our customers demand. 
 
 
 
 
Executive Summary – 2020‐2021 Budget 
Page 6 of 6 
 
Debt: 
No additional borrowings or refinancing are currently projected for the upcoming fiscal year.  
Current debt service mainly consists of notes to City of Henderson for funds associated with 
General  Obligation  bonds,  issued  in  their  name,  which  were  issued  to  fund  various  capital 
projects over time.  All have varying fixed rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.5% with maturities ranging 
from fiscal year 2024 to 2035.  The Utility borrowed funds during a mostly advantageous period 
in interest rates and have wisely refinanced issues when financially beneficial.  Additionally, we 
entered a capital lease in FY 2019, to finance the purchase of a vital piece of equipment, a new 
sewer vacuum truck. 
We are, in conjunction with the City, exploring the potential savings and benefits of refinancing 
our outstanding debt issues considering the current interest rate markets.  However, due to the 
volatility of these markets and the current economic conditions, final determination for any 
potential refinancing will be carefully studied and brought forward for discussion and action later, 
if warranted. 
 
A Final Note: 
The operating margin presented in this budget continues to be sound, considering some specific 
challenges related to sludge disposal and electric costs.  With the implementation of fixed water 
and  wastewater  charges,  along  with  our  previous  comprehensive  review  of  expenses,  both 
overall and specifically in conjunction with cost saving initiatives, we have continued to generate 
cash from operations to adequately fund our debt service and a portion of our needed capital 
expenditures in conjunction with a sensible use of cash reserves.  Based on our required debt 
service  and  budgeted  increase  in  capital  expenditures,  we  are  projecting  to  decrease  cash 
reserves by approximately $1.3 million during the 2021 fiscal year.   
Constant  prudent  examination  of  operating  costs  and  future  capital  needs  will  be  required. 
Additional adjustment to our rate structure will likely be necessary in the future to sufficiently 
fund operations and capital projects. Furthermore, possible refinancing of outstanding debt and 
additional borrowings for critical capital needs may be warranted, especially if advantageous 
interest rates continue. 
In conclusion, the budget continues to be austere.  Needed actions have been taken to improve 
the overall financial position of the Utility but additional measures will likely be needed to ensure 
that  future  operating  and  capital  needs  are  sufficiently  met.  Continuous  examination  of 
operations and capital infrastructure, both in the short and long term, considering ever evolving 
economic, regulatory, and environmental conditions will be essential. 
We want to thank our Administrative Staff for their diligence and professionalism in working on 
this document.  It represents a combined effort of many people.   This group has an ongoing 
commitment to providing safe, clean, dependable, and reasonably priced water, wastewater, and 
stormwater services, from intake to outfall, for the citizens of Henderson and our service area.

Insurance Premium Tax Proceeds Set-Aside 
The attached municipal order authorizes a portion of 
the Insurance Premium Tax proceeds be 
set-aside for future capital projects and debt payments. 
As discussed at the May 19, 2020 budget work session, the Board of Commissioners desired 
to set-aside funds to be used for future capital projects and debt payments. It was determined 
to use the increase in the Insurance Premium Tax for this purpose. However, upon staff 
review it was determined that establishing those amounts from each insurance company 
would be difficult due to the increase only being on a portion of 
the premiums. 
Finance Director Robert Gunter suggested using ten percent of all insurance premium tax 
proceeds as a solution and will be available to answer any questions you may have. 
Your approval of 
the attached municipal order is requested.

Commissioners 
voiced its desire to set aside the increase for future capital projects and debt payments; and 
WHEREAS, staff recommends ten percent (10%) of all insurance premium tax 
proceeds will be set aside in a committed account within the General Fund to be used for future 
capital projects and debt payments, which recommendation the City Manager approves. 
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the City of 
Henderson, Kentucky, that 
the recommendation of the City Manager is approved, and ten percent (10%) of all insurance 
premium tax proceeds will be set aside in a committed account within the General Fund to be used

Purchase of 
Truck Scale 
The accompanying resolution authorizes the purchase of an electronic truck scale 
replacement from American Scale Corp., Evansville, Indiana, in the amount of 
$49,588.00. 
Included in the purchase is the removal of the existing scale serving the transfer 
station/landfill and placement of the new scale on the same foundation. The scale shall 
be compatible with CompuWeigh software or include all hardware and/or software to 
provide a turnkey project. The scale will replace an old unit that has outlived its useful 
life and is in need of 
replacement. 
Bid packages were sent to ten vendors, with three bids received. The low bid of Weigh-
Tech, Inc. did not meet specifications as a tum-key project because it did not include 
freight, as well as the scale becoming City property during transport, and additional 
installation costs for parts and labor. American Scale, Inc. was the low bidder meeting all 
specifications and award is recommended accordingly. 
The scale is included in the fiscal year 2021 budget. 
Award of the purchase is 
recommended now with final installation completed in the coming fiscal year with 
payment at that time. 
Your approval of 
the attached municipal order is requested.

Bid Reference No. 20-15 
Bids were opened May 26, 2020 for Truck Scale Replacement Project. The bids opened were as follows: 
Bidder 
Amount 
Weigh-Tech, Inc. 
$46,700.00 
American Scale Corp. 
$49,588.00 
J. A. King 
$50,057.00 
This bid is for the Truck Scale Replacement Project at the Landfill. The City received three (3) bids for this 
project. 
The low bid from Weight-Tech, the Survivor - OTR Truck Scale, met most of 
the specifications but did 
come with some possible added freight cost, as well as the scale becoming City property as it leaves the 
factory in Alabama. We would be responsible for any damage that may occur on the trip to Henderson. 
The customer (City of 
Henderson) would need to supply some parts and possible labor to Project. The 
biggest issue with this Scale is that installation would require up to ten (10) business days to complete, and 
the nearest tech support for future repairs would be at least 35 minutes away. 
The second bid from American Scale Corp., the Centurion B-Tek CT-6010-AT, comes with everything 
included and no additional costs. Installation of 
this Scale would be up to two (2) long business days. The 
City of 
Henderson has worked with this company for the last 12-15 years on our Landfill Scale 
maintenance and repairs and we have always received reliable, quality service. With tech support 
approximately 10 minutes away the onsite response time (in most cases) has been one hour or less. 
The Landfill generates approximately $4,500.00 in daily revenue and each day the Scale is out of 
service 
we stand to lose some of 
that revenue. 
I recommend that Bid Reference# 20-15, Truck Scale Replacement Project, be awarded to American Scale 
Corp., 2102-A Kotter Ave., Evansville, IN 47715-8515 for the amount of 
$49,588.00
