Ref:  Governor Scotts Executive Order and Addendum dated 5-22-20. 
 
Municipal Clerks, 
 I hope this correspondence finds you healthy and safe.  I write this in anticipation of an announcement 
that Governor Scott will be making later this morning at his press conference. It is believed that the 
Governor will announce that outdoor seating will be permitted at restaurants and bars starting as early 
as today.  This action is taken in an attempt to bring some much-needed revenue to a stalled and 
struggling industry. 
 
The process he has outlined for this to occur is that any current licensee that has an Outside 
Consumption Permit (OCP) may utilize the area with certain restrictions and conditions. For licensee’s 
that have an OCP in place, there is no action required by the licensee or the town as they are already 
permitted locations approved by the municipality and the Division of Liquor Control (DLC). 
 
However, if a liquor licensee does not currently hold an OCP or needs/desires to modify the current 
outside consumption area description, they must submit a completed application for a provisional OCP 
to DLC on the prescribed form. https://liquorcontrol.vermont.gov/provisional-ocp   They must also 
immediately submit an OCP application to the municipality for approval by the local control 
commissioners. 
https://liquorcontrol.vermont.gov/sites/dlc/files/documents/Licensing/Forms/FILLABLE_Form_Outside_
Consumption_Permit.pdf   They will be given until June 12, 2020 to have this OCP approved by the 
municipality.  If they fail to apply for this and have it approved by June 12, 2020, the provisional OCP will 
expire on that date. If they submit the application to the municipality, and the municipality fails to take 
any action on the application by June 12, 2020. The OCP will be deemed to be approved as presented to 
the town by DLL. DLC will issue these provisional OCP’s and email a copy to the municipality of 
jurisdiction as well as directly to the licensee.   
 
I would like to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation as we navigate through 
these unprecedented and challenging times.  I am available for you to contact at any time by phone 802-
828-2348 or email martin.prevost@vermont.gov .  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or 
concerns.

DECLARING JUNE 19, 2019 “JUNETEENTH FREEDOM DAY” IN  
THE TOWN OF HARTFORD, VERMONT 
 
WHEREAS, Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemorating the abolition of slavery 
in the United States and the emancipation of African American slaves throughout the Confederate 
South. Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865 with news that the war had 
ended and the enslaved were now free, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation 
was issued on January 1, 1863. Until that day, slavery had been relatively unaffected in Texas by 
the Emancipation Proclamation, and Texas had even been viewed as a safe haven for slave owners 
to relocate with their slaves because the state experienced no large-scale fighting or significant 
presence of Union troops; and  
WHEREAS, On that first Juneteenth, a name that combines June and 19th, the people of Texas 
were read General Order Number 3, which stated: "The people of Texas are informed that in 
accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This 
involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, 
and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free 
laborer." The Juneteenth announcement was met with jubilation that spread throughout the country 
as African Americans relocated to neighboring states and became reacquainted with family; and  
WHEREAS, The first Juneteenth celebration was a time for reassurance, prayer and the gathering 
of family members. Juneteenth continued to be widely observed decades later, with many former 
slaves and descendants making an annual pilgrimage back to Galveston. Juneteenth today 
continues to grow within communities and organizations throughout the country. Numerous local 
and national Juneteenth organizations have arisen alongside older organizations with the common 
mission of promoting and cultivating knowledge and appreciation of African American history 
and culture, while encouraging continuous self-development and respect for all people and 
cultures; and  
WHEREAS, During the 2008 legislative session, Vermont became the 29th state in the nation to 
have an official state observance of Juneteenth Freedom Day, which will be commemorated 
annually in Vermont on the third Saturday in June.  
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Chair of the Hartford Selectboard Dan 
Fraser hereby proclaims June 19, 2020: “JUNETEENTH FREEDOM DAY” in the Town of 
Hartford. We encourage Hartford residents, schools, businesses and community groups to 
celebrate Juneteenth as a day of remembrance and celebration.  
ADOPTED this 9th day of June 2020.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Hazard mitigation planning helps a community identify and 
prioritize actions it can take to reduce or eliminate risks to 
people and property from natural and manmade hazards.  The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) further 
describes hazard mitigation planning as a process that state 
and local governments should use to identify community risks 
and vulnerabilities associated with known hazards, to better 
plan for, withstand and recover from disaster events 
(www.fema.gov/plan/mitplanning).  
THE FOUR PHASES OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 
Mitigation planning is only one of four phases of 
emergency management. Preparedness, response, and 
recovery are the other pieces of the cycle. At any one 
time, a community may be in more than one phase of 
emergency management. It is important to distinguish 
between these four phases, especially between mitigation 
and preparedness. Mitigation is often confused with 
preparedness, and vice versa. Below are descriptions of 
each of the four phases of emergency management: 
 
• Mitigation: preventing future emergencies or 
minimizing their effects 
o Includes any activities that prevent an 
emergency, reduce the chance of an 
emergency happening, or reduce the 
damaging effects of unavoidable 
emergencies.  
o Buying flood and fire insurance for your 
home is a mitigation activity. 
o Mitigation activities take place before and 
after emergencies.  
• Preparedness: preparing to handle an emergency 
o Includes plans or preparations made to 
save lives and to help response and rescue 
operations.  
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

o Training and proper equipment are 
preparation 
o Evacuation plans and stocking food and 
water are both examples of preparedness.  
o Preparedness activities take place before an 
emergency occurs.  
• Response: responding safely to an emergency 
o Includes actions taken to save lives and 
prevent further property damage in an 
emergency situation. Response is putting 
your preparedness plans into action.  
o Rescuing people from flooding or putting 
out a fire are both response activities.  
o Response activities take place during an 
emergency.  
• Recovery: recovering from an emergency 
o Includes actions taken to return to a 
normal, preferably incorporating mitigation 
actions to create an even safer situation 
following an emergency.  
o Recovery includes getting financial 
assistance to help pay for the repairs. 
o Rebuilding damaged roads or providing 
loans to businesses are both recovery 
activities.  
o Recovery activities take place after an 
emergency.  
 
 
PURPOSE OF MITIGATION PLANNING 
The purpose of this hazard mitigation plan is to identify and plan 
for both natural and manmade hazards facing the Town of 
Hartford, and to develop strategies to reduce long-term risks.  
Hazards cannot be eliminated, but it is possible to determine 
those hazards that are most likely to occur, where they may be 
most severe and cause the most damage, and what can be done 
to reduce their impacts on the community.  Benefits of hazard 
mitigation planning include: 
 
increased public awareness of natural and manmade 
hazards and community vulnerabilities, 
 
improved understanding of potential risks and possible risk 
reduction measures associated with existing and future 
development, 
 
strengthened partnerships and lines of communication 
among diverse interests, including opportunities to leverage 
and share resources,  
 
increased community and voter support for specific actions 
the town may propose to reduce future losses, 
 
a reduction in physical, financial and emotional losses 
caused by natural and manmade disasters,  
 
increased community resilience to withstand and more 
quickly recover from disasters, and     
 
community eligibility for federal hazard mitigation grants 
and aid prior to and following federally-declared disasters, 
and for additional state matching funds for associated 
repairs and improvements. 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

OVERVIEW   
The previous Hartford Hazard Mitigation 
Plan (HMP) was adopted by the town on 
June 24, 2014, and subsequently approved 
by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) on July 24, 2014. HMPs are 
only effective for five years, and must then 
be updated and adopted by the town and 
approved by FEMA again.    
The 2014 HMP was one of the first Vermont 
plans 
to 
incorporate 
a 
much 
more 
comprehensive approach in the scope and 
citizen participation in the development of an HMP. Vermont’s 
and FEMA’s new mitigation framework both focus on 
strengthening community “resilience” – to not only understand 
and reduce risks of future events, but to also empower 
communities to recover more quickly and effectively when 
disasters occur. The 2014 HMP also followed Tropical Storm 
Irene in August 2011, the largest, most damaging and costly 
flood since 1927 – by some estimates a 130-year flood – to hit 
Vermont and Hartford.  
Many properties in White River Junction, Hartford Village and 
Quechee were inundated in the 2011 flood; buildings in West 
Hartford, the West Hartford and Quechee bridges, and town 
infrastructure suffered serious damage; and much of the 
floodplain, including local parks and farm fields, was covered 
with several inches of silt.  It took the Town nearly five years to 
repair the majority of the public infrastructure 
damaged by Tropical Storm Irene, and most 
property owners, businesses and resident to 
recover.  And for some the recovery never 
occurred.  Local lessons learned from Irene 
helped inform this planning process. 
In October 2014, the state enacted new 
Emergency Relief and Assistance Fund (ERAF) 
rules that provide additional state matching 
funds for federal disaster relief under FEMA’s 
Public Assistance Program (FEMA typically 
requires 
a 
25% 
match). 
To 
qualify, 
municipalities must have taken four actions: 
adopt updated road standards, participate in 
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) 
by adopting flood hazard area regulations, 
annually 
adopt 
a 
local 
emergency 
management plan, and have a local Hazard 
Mitigation Plan approved by FEMA. Under 
ERAF, there is a financial incentive that allows 
the town to lessen their financial burden 
during federally declared disasters. By having 
taken these four basic actions, the state will 
contribute half (12.5%) of the 25% match on 
federal disasters.  
A fifth incentive that not many communities in Vermont take 
advantage of is to adopt either a River Corridor bylaw or 
participate in the Community Rating System (CRS). River 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
5 
 
 
 
Corridor bylaws regulate lands mapped by the State of Vermont 
that are usually beyond the FEMA-mapped flood zone, with the 
concern being erosion that can undermine structures. CRS is a 
complicated administrative process with a simple premise – 
that taking additional flood prevention steps will lessen flood 
damages. Communities in the CRS enjoy lower flood insurance 
rates. 
Having either of the fifth actions will lower the financial burden 
under the ERAF rule to only a 7.5% match for the town. At the 
time of this writing, the town is financially responsible for 
17.5% on the dollar in federally declared disasters due to the 
expiration of the local hazard mitigation plan. Every percent 
saved in a million-dollar disaster is $10,000. 
Separately, in 2014, state planning law (24 V.S.A. Chapter 117) 
required that all updated municipal comprehensive plans must 
include a “flood resilience” element, addressing both flooding 
and fluvial erosion hazards.  This requirement was met with the 
adoption of Hartford’s Town Plan on June 4, 2019.  The new 
Hartford Town Plan flood resilience section references and 
incorporates material from the 2014 adopted and FEMA-
approved hazard mitigation plan.   
In 2013, Hartford agreed to participate under a FEMA grant, as 
an example of a larger, professionally-staffed community with 
strong technical resources, to help test and hone public 
outreach tools, and to help develop mitigation strategies 
appropriate to communities that have adopted comprehensive 
and strategic plans, and a range of land use regulations and 
ordinances.  
II. PLANNING PROCESS 
 
PUBLIC PROCESS   
 
The process followed in developing the 2014 plan was as 
important as the plan itself, by actively seeking public input to 
identify hazards and community vulnerabilities, and local 
actions to be taken to reduce and mitigate known hazards.  The 
four parts of the planning process included: 
  
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
6 
 
 
 
 
Public Involvement – to receive and consider community 
input from diverse stakeholders. 
 
 
Risk Assessment – to estimate the potential frequency and 
magnitude of hazard events, and to identify and plan for the 
most probable hazards and their potential impacts on both 
the built environment and the local community. 
 
 
Mitigation Strategies – to develop goals, objectives and 
strategies aimed at mitigating future disaster losses, that  
are cost-effective, technically feasible, and environmentally 
sound – and timed to allow for strategic investment of 
scarce resources.  
 
Implementation and Monitoring – to identify, assign and 
schedule priority implementation tasks, and to monitor 
their progress over time. 
This current Hazard Mitigation Plan represents an update of the 
2014 standalone, single jurisdiction HMP, and builds upon a 
well vetted roadmap that went far beyond the five-year 
approval period of the plan.    
This plan reflects local priorities for hazard mitigation, as 
determined from the community planning process, and best 
available federal, state and local information.  Action items are 
included to monitor the success or effectiveness of 
implementation and results, and to inform the next update of 
the plan. 
The goals, strategies and actions laid out in the 2014 HMP 
continue to be relevant today.  Bringing the plan to life has 
become a core task of the Town’s citizen Community Resilience 
Organization initiated and appointed by the Hartford 
Selectboard in 2014.   These include: 
 
community involvement in hazard mitigation planning,  
 
better incorporate social and economic considerations,  
 
identify and address manmade as well as natural hazards, 
and  
 
better integrate local comprehensive and hazard mitigation 
planning.   
 
Given the continued relevance of the 2014 HMP in the 2020 
update, it is important to review the process and outcomes of 
the 2014 public process, and what has taken place over the past 
West Hartford Public Meeting 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
7 
 
 
 
five years that builds upon the 2014 HMP. For the 2014 HMP, 
there were several different types of public input meetings and 
methods throughout the Town gather public input. These 
focused on the planning process, collecting stories on the 
history of hazards in the community, technical information on 
local hazards, and identifying priority hazards and possible 
mitigation strategies. 
With the diversity of the community, five village centers, and 
rural, suburban and urban parts of town, having a multifaceted 
approach to gathering input was important. This enabled the 
town to have a comprehensive approach that could serve as a 
base for the new HMP structure guided by the new FEMA rules 
for hazard mitigation planning.  
SUMMARY OF 2014 PUBLIC PROCESS 
Two sets of public meetings were held to gather public input 
into the 2014 update of the HMP:  an initial set to explain the 
planning process being launched and collect stories on the 
history of hazards in the community, and a second set to provide 
more technical information on local hazards, and identify 
priority hazards and possible mitigation strategies.  
 
The first group of meetings was held above the Upper Valley 
Food Co-op in White River Junction, at the Quechee Library in 
Quechee Village, and in the West Hartford Village Store.  The 
second set was held in the Hartford Municipal Building in 
downtown White River Junction and at the West Hartford 
Village Store.  In each case the meetings were noticed in the 
Valley News, on the town website and via posters in public 
locations. Email notice was also provided to town clerks and 
other contacts from surrounding towns who had expressed 
interest, as well as the Two Rivers-Ottauquechee Regional 
Commission, of which the town is a member.  Commission staff 
have assisted the town with its past and present hazard 
mitigation planning efforts. 
A broader effort to increase attendance and participation was 
also made through connections with various organizations 
serving the larger community, including: 
   
 
The United Valley Interfaith Project 
 
Upper Valley housing nonprofits, including the Upper Valley 
Haven, the Upper Valley Housing Coalition and Cover,  
 
Transition Town Hartford and the East Central Vermont 
Sustainability Coalition, 
 
Vital Communities the Hartford Chamber of Commerce,  
 
the Hartford Schools Superintendent, and 
 
the Two Rivers-Ottauquechee Regional Commission and the 
Upper Valley Lake Sunapee Regional Planning Commission,  
 
A total of twenty-one people (not counting staff and facilitators) 
attended the first set of three meetings.  The best attended 
meeting was the West Hartford meeting, with a dozen people 
crowded into the West Hartford Village Store’s new post office 
section. The results of the second set of public meetings 
addressing 
priority 
hazards, 
perceived 
community 
vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigation strategies, are 
highlighted elsewhere in this plan (Appendix D).

Following the public meetings there were multiple Planning 
Commission meetings, which also included members of the 
Conservation Commission, to digest public feedback and to 
identify and discuss possible mitigation strategies.  Final 
meetings to approve the plan, including the recommended 
implementation program, were held with the Selectboard and 
Town Manager during their regularly scheduled meetings. 
 
2019/2020 PUBLIC PROCESS 
The 2014 HMP public process was so immersive with the public 
by holding various in-person meetings throughout the town, 
that staff wanted to build on that process by taking a slightly 
different approach with the 2020 HMP update. As the HMP 
expired in 2019, the town created a Flood Resilience element 
and incorporated it into the new 2019 Hartford Master Plan. 
Thorough discussions with the Planning Commission and 
Selectboard were held on what it means to be flood resilient. 
Many of these elements were already present in the 2014 HMP, 
but these discussions certainly influenced the 2020 HMP and 
reaffirmed town goals.  
 
In 2020, formal work on the new HMP began. The Town of 
Hartford hired an outside consultant, Rebecca Sanborne-Stone, 
to conduct a scenario exercise game (Extreme Event Game) for 
the public. This meeting was held on January 27, 2020 at the 
Bugbee Senior Center in White River Junction. As people 
arrived, they were assigned roles within a specific sector of the 
community, such as first responder, public works director, 
community organizer, business owner, etc.  People also were 
given an opportunity to choose a limited number of resources to 
use in a disaster.  As the flood disaster played out, people 
realized the shortcomings of some of their resource choices.  
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

The exercise also revealed opportunities and gaps in our 
abilities as a community to anticipate and respond jointly in a 
disaster event.  One strong take-away was reaffirming the need 
to build strong neighborhood networks that can kick-in when 
our normal paths of communication are lost. 
 
The Town of Hartford also hired the Two Rivers-Ottauquechee 
Regional Commission (TRORC) to work with town staff on the 
update and to conduct public meetings and outreach after this 
initial Extreme Event Game in January.  A 2020 HMP planning 
team was created to include members of the Parks & Recreation 
Department, Planning & Zoning Department, the Hartford 
Planning Commission, and the Resilient Hartford organization. 
These individuals serve as the main consultation group for the 
HMP update process. Prior to another public meeting, TRORC 
staff, Resilient Hartford, and town planning staff worked 
together on a community survey to garner feedback beyond 
public meetings. This survey was created in paper form and on 
Google Forms and was open to the public to fill out for three 
weeks. The survey was disseminated through social media, 
posters displayed throughout town to include the Town Offices, 
Libraries, and other public places, and sent out on the Hartford 
listserv. In total, forty-four responses were submitted. The 
results of this survey are spread throughout this HMP, but you 
can view the full results in Appendix X.  
 
On March 11, 2020, a public meeting was held at the Hartford 
High School cafeteria. Notices for this meeting were published 
in The Valley News, on the Hartford listserv, social media sites, 
the TRORC and Town of Hartford Websites, and posters 
displayed throughout town. In addition to paid staff and 
consultants, four members of the public attended this public 
meeting. The low turnout for this public meeting was because 
COVID-19 was just beginning to spread in the United States.  
 
 
Figure 1: Hartford High School Meeting 
TRORC began the meeting by explaining what an HMP is and 
how they are useful for communities. The second part of the 
meeting was a hazard ranking. The participating members of the 
public were asked to identify natural or man-made hazards that 
came to mind that could potentially affect Hartford in the future, 
or hazards that have already occurred in town. Once a

comprehensive list was developed, the public spent time 
ranking  these hazards on a scale from Low to High based on a 
combination of the likely severity of damage from that hazard, 
the frequency that Hartford might experience it, and whether 
Hartford, or a subset of Hartford, was particularly vulnerable to 
the impacts from it. Low indicated that the particular hazard 
was a low overall risk to the town in the near future, and High 
being that the hazard was a high risk to Hartford. This hazard 
ranking has guided the ‘meat’ of which hazards the HMP should 
focus on to lower risk in the future, whether they are natural or 
man-made.  
 
During this update process, much of the country was ordered 
to self-isolate or quarantine due to COVID-19. The Town of 
Hartford recognized the importance of the mitigation plan and 
wanted to continue working on it.  
 
Since it was unlikely that in-person meetings would be 
conducted for several months, town staff and TRORC turned to 
electronic means to conduct public meetings and receive 
feedback on the plan.  
 
On April 29, 2020, a virtual meeting was held with nine 
individuals that included Hartford staff, Resilient 
Hartford, and members of the public to go over potential 
mitigation actions the town can take up over the next five 
years. The meeting began with an overview of what a 
hazard mitigation plan is for anyone new to the process, 
as well as a thorough explanation of mitigation actions 
and how they can be implemented throughout the life of 
the plan. The last half 
of this meeting was 
spent going through 
the mitigation actions 
from the 2014 HMP 
and crossing off 
actions that were 
either completed or 
no longer relevant for 
the town to pursue. 
Major additions to the 
2020 HMP is the 
inclusion of pandemic 
mitigation actions, 
and some general 
actions related to 
lower rated hazards 
that may affect the 
town.  
 
On May 19, 2020, 
TRORC and Hartford 
town staff gave a presentation to the Hartford 
Selectboard at their regular meeting. TRORC informed the 
selectboard of all of the meetings and outreach efforts 
that have been taking place for this updated HMP, as well 
as an overview of new hazards and mitigation actions 
that were added to the plan. The selectboard had several 
questions for TRORC on how top hazards were selected 
and if there was room to place mitigation actions for 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

lesser hazards that ranked lower on the ranking chart. 
Several other comments and suggestions were made by 
the selectboard, which TRORC incorporated into this plan.   
 
DATA AND INFORMATION 
   
Much of the information for this plan was provided by the 
Hartford Department of Planning and Development Services  
(DPDS) and taken from the 2019 Hartford Town Master Plan 
and other available federal, state and local datasets and studies. 
These included the 2018 Vermont State Hazard Mitigation Plan, 
federal census and hazards event information, and historical 
accounts.   
 
The information gathered via public process was augmented by 
interviews with key personnel, including public works staff and 
emergency service providers (see footnoted information).  
Technical expertise and plan maps were provided by the Two 
Rivers-Ottauquechee Regional Commission.  
 
INTEGRATION INTO TOWN DECISION-MAKING   
 
The current Hartford Town Master Plan, Capital Improvements 
Program and Emergency Management Plan, as well as related 
municipal strategic plans and studies, helped inform 
development of this plan.  Similarly, once adopted and 
approved, this plan will then be incorporated in the next 
iterations of these related town plans and programs.  The 
implementation program in this HMP includes recommended 
strategies to update town infrastructure standards, flood hazard 
regulations, and related development review standards under 
the town’s zoning and subdivision bylaws.  Hartford’s 
professional staff will continue to work collaboratively with 
town boards, commissions, volunteers and regional and state 
officials to implement this plan.

III. COMMUNITY PROFILE 
 
SETTING  
 
The Town of Hartford, consisting of approximately 29,438 acres 
or 46 square miles, is located along the Connecticut, 
Ottauquechee, and White Rivers in Windsor County Vermont. 
Hartford is functionally part of the larger Upper Valley Region, 
which spans the Connecticut in Vermont and New Hampshire. 
Neighboring Vermont towns include Woodstock, Sharon, 
Norwich, Hartland and Pomfret.  The New Hampshire towns of 
Hanover, Lebanon and Plainfield lie directly across the river.    
 
The White River bisects the town and joins the Connecticut 
River in White River Junction, the town’s largest village. The 
historic villages of West Hartford and Hartford are also located 
on the White River.  The Ottauquechee River meanders in and 
out of the southern part of town, through Quechee Village.  The 
village of Wilder sits above the Wilder dam on the Connecticut 
River.   Elevations in town range from about 340 feet above sea 
level along the Connecticut River at the Hartland boundary to 
the town’s highest hills, peaking at 1,575 feet along the Pomfret 
boundary. 
 
The Town of Hartford includes five unincorporated villages (all 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places) a mix of more 
recent residential and commercial development, rural farmland 
along its major river valleys and hillsides, and more sparsely 
settled forested uplands.   
 
White River Junction, the town’s historic downtown, rail 
center and warehouse district, has long served as a major  
transportation hub in the region – initially for river travel, 
followed by rail and most recently the state’s interstate highway 
system, where Interstates 89 and 91 meets.  White River 
Junction developed as the first major railroad center north of 
Boston – as reflected in its late 18th and early 19th century urban 
architecture.  Today it serves as the center of the town’s

commercial, civic and cultural life.  The Hartford Town Hall is 
also located downtown.   
 
White River Junction’s central business district has been 
undergoing a renaissance of new investment and development, 
supported in part by the 2009 White River Junction 
Revitalization Plan and the state-approved White Rive Junction 
Tax 
Increment

(TIF) 
District. 
 
Downtown 
redevelopment has included new construction and adaptive 
reuse of several historic buildings –including former freight 
houses and an elegant old post office – to house new businesses 
restaurants, state government offices, a professional theater 
(Northern Stage), an event venue (Freighthouse).  the Center for 
Cartoon Studies, and over 150 unites of new housing.  
 
Another key commercial area – the Sykes Mountain Avenue/ 
Route 5 Commercial Area – includes a concentration of 
commercial development on US 5 in the vicinity of the 
interchange junction of Interstates 89 and 91. This area includes 
several car dealerships, hotels/motels, restaurants, banks, bus 
station, and other retail and office uses, all within view of the 
Veterans Hospital complex.  This area is also within the 
boundary of the state-designated Hartford Growth Center.  
Major employers include the Veterans Administration (VA) 
Hospital, the US Postal Service and state government.   
 
The Hartford Town Hall is located in the mapped floodplain but 
had substantial work done to improve its flood resilience in a 
major upgrade in 2014/2015.  Sections of White River Junction 
along the banks of the White and Connecticut Rivers flooded 
during Irene, but much of the central square and buildings along 
North and South Main Streets were untouched by the storm.  
Flash flooding in 2013 and 2017 had more of an impact, filling 
the basements of several downtown businesses with 
stormwater.  
 
Quechee Village, listed on the National Register as a historic 
mill village, is also the site of the famous Quechee Gorge – a 
narrow canyon one mile long and 165 feet deep that is crossed 
by US 4. 
 
Quechee is also home to the Quechee Lakes planned resort 
community, first established in the late 1960s.  This 
development has attracted higher income second home 
investment and, in turn, higher-end retail, lodging and 
Like many other Vermont towns, Hartford has a mixture of 
densely settled villages surrounded by open countryside.  
Hartford has always served as a major gateway to the State, first 
via the Connecticut and White Rivers, then the railroads, and 
most recently the interstate highways… 
 
Much of Hartford’s land use planning and decision-making 
revolves around the appropriate use of our manmade and natural 
resources.  Manmade resources include public water and 
wastewater systems, the road network, parking lots, public and 
private buildings, farms and recreational facilities.  Hartford’s 
natural resources include forests, agricultural lands, surface and 
ground water, scenic views, clean air, wildlife, minerals and soils.  
They present both opportunities for and constraints on 
development…

restaurant establishments – including the Simon Pearce 
restaurant, glass blowing and pottery facility located in the old 
Quechee Mill.  The village includes a library, a public elementary 
school, two private elementary schools and a private high 
school.   
 
Quechee Gorge State Park, a state campground and recreation 
area, is located above the Quechee Gorge, off US 4.  The land for 
the park, purchased by the US Army Corps of Engineers as part 
of a larger flood control plan (which included the construction 
of the North Hartland Dam), was subsequently leased to the 
state.  Most structures in Quechee are not in the mapped flood 
hazard area, but the Quechee Covered Bridge suffered extensive 
damage from Tropical Storm Irene, resulting in its closure for 
more than a year.  The main sewer line serving Quechee Village, 
running under the riverbed, was also damaged. The lower 
portion of Quechee Main Street flooded, resulting in severe 
damage to a real estate business, a section of Simon Pearce, and 
two properties on Watermain Hill Road.  The Bridge was 
reconstructed to mitigate the impact of future floods.   The real 
estate property next to the brides was part of the FEMA buyout 
program, and now is a pocket park.  The Waterman Hill 
properties also were bought through the FEMA program, and 
the slope is now stabilized. Other historic sites, including the 
Theron Boyd House site (not the building) that were affected by 
erosive flooding were repaired.  
 
Wilder Village and Hartford Village both include a mix of low- 
and moderate-income housing and commercial and industrial 
uses.  Hartford Village, located along VT 14, includes a 
convenience store/gas station, private school, post office, 
library and two churches.  Wilder, with its own I-91 interchange, 
has attracted new condominium and office park development.  
It also has an elementary school and post office.  
 
West Hartford, surrounded by farm fields and forests and 
crossed by the Appalachian Trail, is the most rural and remote 
of Hartford’s five villages.  The village is located in the 
northwestern section of town on the Sharon/Pomfret border, 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
15 
 
 
 
sandwiched between VT 14, the rail line and the White River. 
The village is still home to several historic buildings, including a 
church, library, and the former West Hartford Village Store.  
 
Almost half of West Hartford was wiped out by the 1927 flood.  
The village was hit hard again during Tropical Storm Irene. 
Several homes and civic buildings, including the library, Post 
Office and general store, were flooded by high water that also 
damaged the bridge over the White River.  Deep silt deposits 
across VT 14 temporarily isolated the community from the rest 
of the town.   The West Hartford Congregational Church, which 
did not flood, served as the local hub for Irene relief efforts. 
The West Hartford Village Store reopened in April 2012 after 
extensive repair work, and resumed its importance as a village 
gathering place but has since closed.    Most homes were rebuilt, 
and a few replaced. but two of the most damaged were included 
in the FEMA buyout program and one in through another 
funding source for buyout, all three were demolished, as well as 
two 
commercial 
buildings 
adjacent 
to 
the 
library.  
Reconstruction of the West Hartford Library included elevating 
the existing building above flood levels, floodproofing and 
landscaping, and converting the adjacent buyout sites into a 
park and parking lot. 
  
GROWTH TRENDS  
 
The Town of Hartford experienced steady growth and 
development throughout much of the 20th century and the first 
six years of the 21st century.  However, following the recession 
of 2008, local growth slowed significantly, mirroring regional 
and state trends.    Growth rates began to rebound in 2013 and 
the Town has experienced moderate residential growth since 
then.     
 
Population. According to the most recent US Census counts, 
Hartford’s 2010 population numbered 9,952, indicating that the 
year-round population declined by 4% between 2000 and 2010.  
As a result, Hartford dropped from the 8th to the 9th most 
populated municipality in the state.  It remains the largest 
community in the county, making up nearly 18% of Windsor 
County’s total population.  The town has an overall population 
density of 221 persons per square mile – much higher than that 
for the county (58 persons per square mile), but most of the 
town’s year-round population is concentrated in White River 
Junction and its other villages. The highest local population loss 
(-11%) occurred in White River Junction, while Wilder grew at 
3.3%.   
 
Hartford’s population is also aging, again following regional and 
state trends.  The median age of town residents in 2010 was 43.3 
– up from 40 in 2000.  Most age groups in Hartford decreased 
between 2000 and 2010, with the exception of 20-24-year olds 
and those 55 years and older.  The town’s seniors (65+ years)

numbered 965 in 2010, making up 17% of the local population, 
and 16% of the county’s senior population.  
This segment of the population is expected to grow in share in 
coming years, requiring more in services – including medical 
and emergency services.  The state has projected that by 2020, 
the county’s senior population could more than double.1  While 
Hartford’s total resident population is projected to reach no 
more than 10,300 by 2020, by then its senior population could 
make up more than 20% of the total – and more than 50% of 
local property taxpayers.   
 
The town’s seasonal population is harder to estimate, but given 
that there were 1,030 vacation homes identified in the 2010 US 
Census – including those in Quechee Lakes – the town’s total 
effective resident population, for planning purposes, could 
increase by more than 2,000 persons, assuming full occupancy 
at two persons per unit.     
 
Hartford’s more vulnerable populations are harder to identify 
but generally include the town’s elderly residents – especially 
those living on their own – those with special medical and 
communication needs, and those with limited resources to 
respond to and recover from disaster events.  In more recent 
years, the Town also has had an increasing homeless population. 
Their vulnerability in severe weather, especially in winter, and 
during the COVID -19 pandemic have been a specific concern of

Commerce and Community Affairs; Scenario A (higher in-migration 
scenario). 
the town. For purposes of emergency response planning, 
identifying vulnerable groups and individuals is generally done 
in association with local service providers and utilities.    
 
The US Census no longer tracks special needs populations.  At 
the local level the Census Bureau instead provides 5-year 
American Community Survey (ACS) estimates.  Given sampling 
over a 5-year period and relatively high margins of error, these 
estimates are generally suspect, and no longer track poverty 
rates and disability status.  The most recent ACS estimates 
(2013-2018) available for Hartford suggest that: 
 
 
15.4% of the town’s working population did not work 
in the past 12 months, 
 
4.7% speaks a language other than English at home, 
and 
 
1.4% speaks English less than very well. 
 
Households.  The number of households in Hartford also 
decreased in the 2000s, with a decline in population.  Of the 
4,446 households counted in the 2010 US Census: 
 
 
59% (2,618) were family households – though only 
25% (1,090) were families with children, 
 
9% (381) were single parent households, and   
 
27% (1,205) included someone 65 years or older. 
 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
17 
 
 
 
The average size of local households also has continued to 
shrink, reflecting in part the town’s aging population and a 
relative increase in the number of one- and two-person 
households.   The average household size for year-round units 
in 2010 was 2.22 persons.    As reported in 2010:  
 
 
33% (1,459) of local households were one-person 
households, 
 
38% (553) of those living alone were senior citizens, 
 
66% (2,953) of households were homeowners, and  
 
34% (1,493) were renters. 
 
In 2010, Hartford also had 77 residents in “group quarters” – 
including 57 nursing home residents and 20 in other non-
institutionalized, group living arrangements. 
 
The loss of a home, even temporarily due to a disaster, is difficult 
for anyone, but can be especially hard for homeowners who 
have large mortgages or don’t have adequate insurance 
coverage – including flood insurance – and for displaced 
households that don’t have the financial resources to secure 
other housing.   ACS estimates (2013-2018) suggest that: 
 
 
63.6% of local homeowners carry a mortgage –they do 
not own their home outright, 
 
32% of local households are very low income house-
holds, with incomes less than 50% of the estimated 
county median of $62,317, 
 
10.7% of households receive food stamp/SNAP benefits, 
and 11% of those households receive cash public 
assistance, 
 
housing costs exceed 30% of household income for 
32.4% of homeowners and 52% of renters, and  
 
7.3% of local households do not have a vehicle. 
 
Housing.   The town’s housing stock reportedly increased by 
323 units (6%) between 2000 and 2010 – despite a depressed 
housing market during the “Great Recession” that began in 
2008.  This increase was due largely to second home 
construction, which accounted for 62% of new units.  In 2010, 
vacation units, mostly second homes and condos located in 
Quechee Lakes, made up 19% of the town’s total housing. 
 
Following the recession, the pace of local housing development 
slowed. The town issued permits for 735 units from 2000 
through 2008 (averaging 82 units per year) – including permits 
for several multifamily housing developments.  Between 2009 
and 2012 permits were issued for an additional 26 units 
(averaging 6.5/year) – all for single family dwellings (US Census 
Bureau Annual Building Permit Estimates).   Between 2013-
2018, housing permits increased to 50 units per year with multi-
family housing making up 81% of the new housing.   
 
Hartford’s housing stock in 2010 made up 18% of the county 
total.    ASC estimates (2013-2018) also suggest that: 
 
 
55.3% of Hartford’s housing units are detached single-
family homes, and another 5.9% are mobile homes,

 
56.9% of the town’s housing stock is more than 50 years 
old (built prior to 1970). 
 
Mobile homes provide much needed affordable housing, but are 
also generally more at risk of damage from flooding and high 
winds.  According to local tax list information, as of 2019 there 
were 407 mobile homes in Hartford, including 305 in mobile 
home parks, and 102 on separate lots.   There are five mobile 
home parks in town, including one – Olcott Falls– owned by the 
Vermont State Housing Authority.  None are located in mapped 
floodplains or high wind areas.  Two parks are connected to 
municipal water and sewer systems; the other two are served 
by private systems that are subject to state oversight. 
 
Hartford no longer maintains a local housing authority – the 
Vermont State Housing Authority now manages the Section 8 
program serving 43 local households.  There are also five  
nonprofit housing organizations active in Hartford:  Twin Pines 
Housing Trust, Windham-Windsor Housing Trust, Upper Valley 
Habitat for Humanity, COVER Home Repair, and the Upper 
Valley Housing Coalition.   
 
Affordable housing in Hartford includes: 
 
 
21 affordable rental properties that provide 331 
income-restricted units, including 83 units specifically 
for the elderly and/or persons with disabilities, and 
 
Four hotel/motel lodging facilities and one rooming 
house that offer a total of 91 rooms for long-term rent.    
 
Hartford also hosts one of Vermont’s eleven emergency shelters 
for the homeless.  The Upper Valley Haven maintains two 
facilities in town – the Byrne Shelter for families and the Hixon 
House for adults.  These facilities serve a regional need, 
generally within a 60-mile radius of White River Junction.  There 
also a growing number of homeless camps in town which 
represent a vulnerable population impacted during sever 
weather events and most recently COVID-19.  In the past year 
the Town established a Homelessness Committee comprised of

town residents, social service organizations, including The 
Haven, and town staff who already are working with this 
vulnerable population.  The committee submitted a report with 
recommendations for short- and long-term options to address 
the housing and social service needs. 
 
Other residential facilities in town include an assisted living 
facility, Valley Terrace, with 61 units and maximum occupancy 
of 71 residents, and an 80-unit assisted living and memory care 
facility, The Village at White River Junction, with 80 units and 
maximum occupancy of 89 residents. 
 
Local Economy.  Hartford, in part because of its location at the 
junction of major transportation routes, is a regional 
employment center for the Upper Valley, along with Lebanon 
and Hanover.  The town has continued to experience some 
economic growth since 2000 – including the addition of 31 
employers and 380 new jobs between 2000 and 2010.  As of 
2010, there were 466 establishments in Hartford, accounting 
for 6,158 jobs, as reported to the state for unemployment 
insurance (covered employment). This does not include most 
self-employed individuals, farmers and farmworkers.     
 
According to 2018 ACS data estimates, 5,111 civilians over the 
age of 16 were employed in Hartford. Of these, 10.4% worked in 
local, state, or federal government. The majority of Hartford 
residents that have a job work at a private company (56.2%). 
Educational services, and health care and social assistance 
industries are the largest group at 35.6% of workers. The 
Veterans Administration Hospital and the US Postal Service’s 
regional distribution facility in White River Junction are two of 
the area’s largest employers within town, and the nearby 
Dartmouth College and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center 
are economic mainstays. Hartford has a smaller share of 
manufacturing and service sector jobs than the county or state 
but, as a major transportation hub, has a higher concentration 
of transportation, communications and utility jobs.  
 
The Town works closely with the Green Mountain Economic 
Development Corporation and regional office of the Small 
business Development Center located in Downtown White River 
Junction, Other partners include the Hartford Development 
Corporation, 
Hartford 
Downtown 
Business 
Association, 
Hartford Area Chamber of Commerce, Vital Communities, and 
Two Rivers-Ottauquechee Regional Commission.   
 
Quechee Lakes, within Quechee Village, is one of the largest 
planned four-season resort communities in New England, 
consisting of more than 5,200 acres of commonly owned land 
and buildings, 1,255 residential and rental properties, a ski area, 
two 18-hole golf courses and a clubhouse, lake, and other resort 
amenities.  Slightly more than half of planned development has 
been built to date.   
 
In 2018, Hartford businesses generated $45 million in room, 
meal and alcohol taxes (23% of the county total) and $386.7 
million in sales tax receipts (31% of the county total), including 
$78.4 million in retail taxes (VT Dept. of Taxes, Annual Report).

Hartford’s Designated Growth Center  
The Hartford Growth Center was approved by the Vermont 
Downtown Board under the state’s growth centers designation 
program on March 22, 2010.  The designated growth center 
includes White River Junction, also a state-designated down-
town, the historic villages of Wilder to the north and Hartford 
Village to the west, and the Sykes Mountain Avenue Area.  This 
2,005-acre area comprises approximately 7% of the town’s 
total land area, centered on the most heavily developed portion 
of town.  The Hartford Growth Center has been planned to 
accommodate approximately 60% of the town’s new housing 
development, and a large majority of its new commercial 
development over the next 20 years.   
 
While growth center boundaries were drawn to exclude most 
natural resource areas, the growth center does include mapped 
floodplains, surface waters and wetlands along the Connecticut 
and White Rivers.  The proposed boundaries were approved by 
the state based on the strength of regulatory mitigation 
strategies proposed by the town, including flood hazard area 
regulations that limit and regulate new development within 
mapped floodplain areas. 
 
Based on its growth center designation, Hartford also applied 
and received approval from the state for a smaller, 114-acre Tax 
Increment Financing (TIF) District centered in downtown White 
River Junction.  This area includes 129 parcels, and represents 
$42.5 million in listed property value.

Over the past six years there have been many new large and 
small businesses and restaurants in new and substantially 
renovated buildings in downtown White River Junction and 
Sykes Mountain Avenue areas.  This economic development is 
the building out of the Town’s Growth Center Plan, Downtown 
Revitalization Plan and the Tax increment Financing District 
Plan, 
in 
areas 
that 
provide 
water, 
wastewater 
and 
telecommunications infrastructure, and access to public 
transportation. 
IV. COMMUNITY ASSETS 
 
Hartford’s community assets, which are substantial for a 
Vermont town, are listed in Appendix B, noted on the 
accompanying maps, and described in more detail as follows. 
 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT   
 
Hartford has a town manager form of government, as set forth 
in its charter.  The appointed Town Manager answers to an 
elected, volunteer, seven-member Selectboard.  The town also 
has an appointed Town Clerk.  In FY19, Hartford employed 183 
people in town government in full-time, part-time and 
temporary positions.  In addition to a health officer, the town 
has the following nine fully staffed departments, all headed by 
directors 
 
• 
Administration 
• 
Planning and Development 
• 
Public Works (includes Recycling/Solid Waste) 
• 
IT 
• 
Police (incudes Emergency Communication Center) 
• 
Fire/EMS 
• 
Parks and Recreation 
• 
Finance 
• 
Assessors 
• 
Town Clerk 
 
 
The town has an adopted emergency management ordinance 
that governs local emergency response and civil defense 
operations.   
 
The town has several volunteer boards, commissions and 
committees appointed by the Selectboard.  Most are advisory to 
the Selectboard, except for the Planning Commission and Zoning 
Board of Adjustment, which are quasi-judicial boards that are 
also governed by state statute.  These boards and commissions, 
with the support of the Department of Planning and 
Development Services, are responsible for town planning, and 
developing and administering the town’s Zoning and 
Subdivision Regulations, including its adopted Flood Hazard 
Regulations.   
 
In addition to the staff noted above, the Selectboard, Planning 
Commission and Resilient Hartford are the local entities most 
responsible for hazard mitigation planning.  Hartford also 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
23 
 
 
 
participates in regional emergency response and hazard 
mitigation planning through its membership on the Two Rivers-
Ottauquechee Regional Commission (TRORC) and the District 
#12 Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  
 
The meetings of local boards, commissions and committees are 
publicly noticed and subject to Vermont’s open meeting laws. 
Many are also covered by the local community cable station.  
Hartford actively maintains a town website, (www.hartford-
vt.org) to inform local residents about town events, initiatives, 
policies and programs.  There is also a town listserv that 
continues to expand.  Both the website and listserv were used 
extensively during Irene recovery.  
 
Municipal government is financed largely through property 
taxes.  Hartford’s tax base, as reported to the state in 2019, 
includes 5,494 properties valued at $1.39 billion ($1.44 billion, 
as adjusted by the state to reflect fair market value).   Residential 
properties make up roughly 66% of all listed properties, and 
60% of total listed property values (2019 VT Dept. Taxes). The 
town, as noted earlier, also has an approved TIF District to 
finance infrastructure improvements and redevelopment 
projects planned for Downtown White River Junction.  
FACILITIES AND SERVICES 
 
Municipal Buildings.  Municipal buildings identified as critical 
facilities include the Hartford Town Hall, the Public Safety 
Building and the Department of Public Works Facility.   
The Hartford Town Hall is the center of local government, 
housing town offices, municipal records, conference and 
meeting space.   The three-story building is a historic former 
school building located on a 3.4-acre site in downtown White 
River Junction.  Built in 1884, it is post and beam construction 
with exterior brick-bearing walls.  The Town Hall is in the 
mapped 100-year floodplain.   Town voters in 2013 approved 
funding to substantially rehabilitate the structure, to include 
floodproofing to improve its flood resiliency, and the 
installation of a generator.  The building renovation was 
completed in 2015.   
 
The Hartford Emergency Services Building, located on a 2.2-
acre site located adjacent to the VA Hospital, houses Hartford’s 
police, emergency response and fire services –including offices, 
operations, training, storage and meeting rooms, five engine 
bays, and an emergency communications center. The building, 
constructed in 1978, is a one- and two-story cement building 
with brick veneer.  The building is equipped with a generator. A 
second unstaffed fire station, Hartford Station 2, is located on 
Willard Road in Quechee. 
 
The Department of Public Works Facility located on Airport 
Road in White River Junction (out of the floodplain) includes 
offices and the town garage and houses the town’s highway and 
public works equipment.  It is also equipped with a generator. 
 
Public Safety.  Public safety services include police, fire and 
emergency response.  Hartford police provide a full range of law 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
24 
 
 
 
enforcement services to the community. Hartford emergency 
services includes both career and paid on-call staff who provide 
fire protection, emergency medical services, technical rescue 
services, and hazardous materials protection to Hartford and 
surrounding communities.  In 2019, the department responded 
to 2,311 calls, locally and under mutual aid agreements, and also 
operates as a mobile support unit for Vermont Emergency 
Management.  The department’s dispatch center provides 
emergency dispatching services for five surrounding towns.   
The Town Manager serves as the town’s designated emergency 
management director. 
  
Zachary Borst, a Regional Outreach Specialist at Vermont 
Emergency Management, noted that “Hartford has one of the 
strongest departments in the state – trained to a higher level 
than usual.  They manage the Southern Vermont Urban Search 
and Rescue Team, housing equipment and team leaders.  This is 
a significant asset for the town, having a huge toolbox and 
trained responders right there.” The department also fields a 
deacon unit for hazardous materials spills and Swiftwater 
rescue. 
In addition to emergency response services, the department 
issues burn permits and construction (fire safety) permits for 
public buildings, and reviews development applications before 
the planning commission and zoning board. 
 
 
2 Information supplied by Tom DeBalsi, Hartford Schools Superintendent on 
May 18, 2020 
Schools. 2   There are 13 educational institutions located in 
Hartford, all considered “critical facilities” by the town for 
purposes of emergency response and hazard mitigation 
planning (see full listing under Appendix B).  These include the 
following six public schools in the Hartford School District: 
 
 
Dothan Brook School, Wilder 
 
White River School, White River Junction 
 
Ottauquechee School, Quechee 
 
Hartford High School, White River Junction 
 
Hartford Memorial Middle School, White River Junction 
 
Hartford Area Career Technology Center, White River 
Junction. 
 
The Hartford School District is one of the town’s largest 
employers, staffed by more than 400 employees who serve 
around 1,900 students. 
 
The Hartford High School anchors a complex in White River 
Junction that also includes the middle school, the technology 
center, and the Wendell A. Barwood Arena, housing the town’s 
ice rink.   
Located on a high plateau between downtown White River 
Junction and Wilder Village, the Hartford High School is also the 
designated local and regional emergency shelter.   The backup 
generator at the high school is intended primarily for its use as 
an emergency shelter.  In the event of an extended power outage 
 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
25 
 
 
 
the generator can operate continuously for up to two days, 
supplying enough power to heat a portion of the building and 
operate one kitchen.  During Tropical Storm Irene the high 
school gym was open for a month to shelter people displaced by 
the storm, while school was in session.  Just a few people stayed 
beyond the first 48 hours after the storm.     
 
All school buildings meet current fire and safety codes. The 
Ottauquechee School lost power during Irene, due to damage to 
utility lines crossing the river under the Quechee Bridge.   All 
schools are equipped with emergency lighting for use in 
building evacuation.  Schools also have police-grade two-way 
radios, operated from a base at the high school, which can be 
used to communicate with other schools in the event of an 
emergency.  
 
A safety team has been formed for each school building, and a 
notification process has been set up for parents via website and 
a computerized phone messaging service that reaches everyone 
within a 10-minute period.  This system is used mainly for snow 
days and works well.  It may be expanded at some point to also 
include e-mail and text notifications 
 
Each school has an evacuation plan, to evacuate students by bus 
within 30 minutes.  Schools are required by the state to test 
these plans six times per year, and to conduct lock-down drills 
five times a year.  Each school also has a designated evacuation 
site in the event of a school emergency, including an outdoor 
staging area to gather and collect students.  School teams are 
discussing how to also respond to external incidents that may 
impact the school – for example a chemical spill on the rail line 
in the vicinity of the White River School – and whether current 
evacuation plans and staging areas are adequate to address 
these types of incidents.    
 
The School Superintendent is working with school staff on 
updating safety and evacuation plans for each school to include 
a more uniform set of emergency response procedures and 
commands.  He also meets quarterly with the town’s emergency 
management 
staff 
to 
build 
cooperation, 
strengthen 
communication and better coordinate local and regional 
emergency response planning.    
 
Transportation. 
 
Hartford 
is 
a 
regional 
crossroads.  
Strategically located at the junction of the Connecticut and 
White Rivers, the town was first a center for river traffic.  It later 
became an important rail center, and today is located at the 
junction of I-89 and I-91.  US Route 4, part of the National 
Highway System and a key east-west connector, crosses town as 
do Vermont Route 14, and US 5 which runs north-south.   
 
Hartford also has more miles of road than any other 
municipality in the state. The state manages 45 miles of state 
and federal highway; the town is responsible for another 129 
miles of town highway.  The town’s Public Works Department 
maintains an ongoing road management system that includes 
regular highway inventory updates and a 10-year capital 
improvement program that identifies roads for routine 
maintenance and reconstruction. 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
26 
 
 
 
 
The road system includes 1,038 culverts, 29 short-span bridges 
and 4 long-span bridges – several of which were damaged and 
repaired after Tropical Storm Irene.   The State of New 
Hampshire owns the bridges crossing the Connecticut River that 
connect Hartford and Lebanon.  Many other major bridges in 
town are state and federal responsibilities– including the 
railroad bridge across the White River in White River Junction, 
which was repaired by the state following Irene.  The West 
Hartford Bridge, constructed in 2006 by the town with state 
assistance, was designed to withstand a 100-year flood, but also 
suffered damage during Irene.3  The Quechee Covered Bridge 
was badly damaged during Irene and completely rebuilt, finally 
reopening in December 2012.  The town completed 
reconstruction of the Bridge Street railroad bridge and 
underpass in White River Junction through a federal highway 
grant, and has recently closed the VA Cutoff bridge spanning the 
White River due to structural issues.   
 
In 2012 Hartford conducted a comprehensive engineering 
review of all its bridges, leading to the adoption of a 20-year 
repair schedule – and separate reserve fund under the town’s 
capital 
improvement 
program 
– 
to 
fund 
scheduled 
improvements over time. 
White River Junction, located halfway between Montreal and 
Boston, remains a major interchange for several rail lines,

including the New England Central Railway and the Northern 
Vermont Railroad. On average, two AMTRAK passenger trains 
and two to four freight trains pass through town each day. 
Freight cars are also stored temporarily in local rail yards.  The 
AMTRAK station on Railroad Row includes parking and an 
enclosed waiting area.   
 
Flood waters from Irene also severely impacted the NECR line, 
inflicting major damage between Montpelier and White River 
Junction.  The storm completely washed away about 2,000 feet 
of roadbed and left rail and ties suspended in mid-air. Two 
bridges over the White River were also heavily damaged, 
including the one in White River Junction.  Tracks were quickly 
repaired and reopened by mid-September 2011.  The rail bridge 
on the Wells River Line reopened in January 2012.   
 
Federally-funded track upgrades to improve AMTRAK service 
allowed for an increase in train speeds effective in 2013 – up to 
59 mph north of White River Junction, and up to 79 mph south 
of the junction.  The 2019 Hartford Town Plan speaks to the 
need to improve the safety of at-grade rail crossings, and to 
address illegal paths and trails crossing the tracks, but also 
notes the expense involved. The town installed a secondary 
emergency access through the rail yard to ensure that the Nutt 
Lane neighborhood will not be cut off by a stopped or derailed 
train blocking access to South Main Street.

There are no airports in Hartford, however parts of town are 
within the landing and take-off area of the Lebanon, New 
Hampshire Municipal Airport across the river, which hosts a 
small commuter airline and private aircraft. 
 
Advance Transit, the regional public transportation provider, is 
based in the Wilder section of town.  It links Hartford to Norwich 
and the New Hampshire towns of Hanover, Lebanon, Enfield 
and Canaan.  Passengers ride for free.  Links are also provided 
to other transit networks that extend travel to Randolph, 
Springfield and St. Johnsbury, Vermont.  The Bugbee Senior 
Center in Hartford provides rides for residents over age 60 by 
appointment.  Other providers also bring passengers to 
Hartford–e.g., to the VA Hospital – from other counties. 
 
Water and Sewer.  The town’s municipal water system – 
supplied by two wells and treatment facilities – one located in 
Wilder and the other in Quechee near Lake Pineo – serves more 
than 2,000 connections in White River Junction, Wilder, 
Hartford Village and Quechee. The system also includes two  
large storage tanks – one in Wilder and one near the VA 
Hospital.  The Wilder well is located above the floodplain; the 
Quechee facility, however, is at or above the 100-year flood 
level.  Protected by a berm, it did not flood during Tropical 
Storm Irene, but came close. The berm was improved following 
Irene to better withstand future flooding.   
 
4 Interview with John Choate, Hartford Utilities Superintendent, March 27, 
2013. 
 
White River Junction, Hartford Village and Wilder Village and 
areas in between are also served by the town’s sewer system.  
Quechee Village has a separate sewer service, limited to the 
village core, including Main Street, US 4 west of Quechee Gorge, 
and several nearby residential developments.  The two 
wastewater treatment plants serving these systems are located 
in White River Junction and Quechee.  The White River Junction 
plant is below the confluence of the White and Connecticut 
Rivers, and is located within the mapped flood hazard area, but 
it did not flood during Irene as the Connecticut River was not 
heavily impacted.  The Quechee sewer plant is located well-
above the 100-year flood elevation.  It also did not flood, 4 but 
the river crossing for the force main serving Quechee Village 
sustained heavy erosion damage from changes in the stream 
channel, which undermined critical infrastructure.  This was 
subsequently repaired with funding and technical assistance 
from the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), with 
special care taken to restore stream flow and aquatic habitat to 
pre-flood conditions.

Pump stations, necessarily located in low-lying areas, are 
especially susceptible to flooding.  Irene flooding damaged three 
pump stations in the town – two in Hartford Village and one in 
White River Junction.  Following the flood, the pump stations 
were rebuilt with town insurance money.   The town received a 
hazard mitigation grant to elevate each of the three stations to 
one-foot above Irene flood levels and completed the work.  
 
In the case of power outages, most of the town’s water and 
wastewater facilities are equipped with emergency generators, 
and the Public Works Department also has a portable generator.  
There is also an emergency backup plan for each facility, as 
required by the state.  The Town of Hartford participates in 
Vermont WARN – the state’s Water/Wastewater Agency 
Response Network. This 145-town mutual aid network provides 
loans of major equipment to towns impacted by a disaster.5  
 
Electrical Service.  There are two substations (Wilder, White 
River Junction) and two transmission lines (Taftsville to Wilder 
and Wilder to White River Junction) that serve the Hartford 
area. The two utilities previously serving Hartford – Central 
Vermont Public Service and Green Mountain Power – merged 
several years ago under Green Mountain Power.  The merger is 
providing more resources for system capacity, reliability 
improvements, and response in outage situations.   Several 
utility upgrades in the area planned for the near future

The West Hartford Community:  Lessons Learned  
 
In the aftermath of Irene, the Village of West Hartford, 
which suffered significant damage, was temporarily cutoff 
from the rest of the community by large deposits of river silt. 
Once the road was re-opened, with the help of a local 
farmer, town government and community service groups 
organized a central location in the village to provide food, 
volunteers, equipment and encouragement.  Within days, 
the West Hartford Church, a deteriorating building not in 
active use – and one of the few buildings not flooded – 
became the village hub, something that has continued to 
day, and sparked interest in its renovation.  The experience 
with the flood also highlighted where there may be gaps in 
communication and services –including communication 
between local services and town government, and how these 
might be better addressed in the future.  Some of these 
opportunities include taking advantage of existing 
networks. 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

Wilder hydroelectric facility to Taftsville (2014).  
 
 
Rebuilding the White River substation which is nearing 
capacity (2015).  The new substation will carry additional 
load and provide backup for the Wilder and potentially the 
Quechee substations.  
 
 
Relocating and replacing a small section of single-phase 
distribution line, to run along VT 14 from Sharon toward 
West Hartford (year or two).   
 
Temporary power outages are a fairly common occurrence, 
particularly during winter months.  Lines are generally well 
maintained and quickly repaired by the utilities, in coordination 
with the town for line work within town rights-of-way, and the 
state work along state highways.  As noted, many municipal 
facilities, including the high school, are equipped with backup 
generators, but there is still concern regarding the impacts that 
extended power outages could have on public buildings and 
facilities, local hospitals and businesses, and especially 
homebound residents with medical equipment.  
 
COMMUNITY RESOURCES 
 
Local Community.  A sense of community – of knowing 
neighbors and those who might be vulnerable in an emergency 
– is an important part of building community resilience.  
Because of Hartford’s size, diversity and settlement pattern, 
many local residents identify more with their neighborhood or 
village than the town as a collective whole.     A current town 
initiative ––“Five villages, three rivers, one town” is intended to 
strengthen town-wide community identity.     
 
Hartford’s villages have especially strong social networks and 
ties.   Quechee Village has grown in recent years in part to serve 
the resort community established there.  West Hartford’s strong 
sense of community reflects the bonding that occurred during 
and following Tropical Storm Irene, when village residents felt 
isolated from the rest of the community.  In larger places like 
White River Junction, in newer housing developments, and in 
more rural locations people tend to identify with their local 
neighborhood, others living in their building or along their road.    
Since 2015, Resilient Hartford, a town appointed community 
resilience organization, was formed as part of a pilot program to 
help make Hartford a more resilient community.  The group has 
focused on resilience educational activities, building community 
and developing partnerships with other organizations.  Since 
2016, Resilient Hartford has hosted 47 workshops, including 
two Resilience Week events and in 2019, the first annual 
Hartford Potato Festival, encouraging backyard gardening for 
greater food security.   
 For many residents, Hartford’s “third places” – local gathering 
spots – also serve as important sources of community 
information and support.  For example, the Upper Valley Food 
Co-op in downtown White River Junction is much more than a 
local grocery store – sponsoring community classes, events and 
activities, and providing meeting space for local groups and 
gatherings.   The Quechee Club serves a similar function as a 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
30 
 
 
 
community gathering place in Quechee Village.  Hartford’s 
libraries, schools and recreation programs also provide space 
and activities that bring people together, as do regional events 
like the Flavors of the Valley.  The development of Northern 
Stage’s new state-of-the-art theater has brought extensive 
programming for all ages, The Upper Valley Aquatic Center 
sponsored Olympic level competitions as well as year-round 
swimming and fitness center opportunities for the community.   
 
There are fourteen churches in Hartford, several of which 
served important roles during the recovery from Tropical Storm 
Irene.  The United Valley Interfaith Project – a consortium of 
faith-based organizations covering the Upper Valley area of New 
Hampshire and Vermont – provided both staff and volunteers to 
assist in the recovery effort.   Hartford also has a number of 
active community organizations – including a local Transition 
Town group which has goals to strengthen local community 
resilience. 
 
Another outgrowth of Irene was the creation of “Upper Valley 
Strong,” comprised of area public and nonprofit service 
agencies, organizations and churches that came together in the 
immediate aftermath of the event.  This group was subsequently 
recognized by the state and FEMA as the area’s Long Term 
Recovery Committee (www.uvstrong.org) to strengthen, 
expand, mobilize and coordinate disaster recovery efforts.   
 
Many participating groups, such as The Haven, Southeastern 
Vermont Community Action (SEVCA), Cover Home Repair, 
Upper Valley Housing Coalition and state social service offices 
are based in or near Hartford.  As a result, town residents and 
property owners were especially well served by regional 
response efforts and resources following Irene.  Upper Valley 
Strong mobilized teams of people to go door-to-door to identify 
those in need and direct resources their way.  As donations were 
received, such as beautiful rugs donated by The Company Store, 
they were stored for pick up in Wilder and made readily 
available to Hartford residents.   
 
Upper Valley Strong continues to exist today and is putting in 
place a structure to allow for immediate mobilization 
when a hazard hits the region.  This became especially 
helpful to quickly mobilize and expand affiliations with 
the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The committee: 
 
 gathers and shares information,  
 assesses individual and community needs,  
 obtains and disburses financial and other resources, 
 conducts triage and disaster case management, 
 expedites local access to services,  
 facilitates interim and permanent housing solutions, and 
 collaborates to resolve the full spectrum of disaster-
caused recovery needs. 
 
Another organization to form in Hartford to help build 
community is the Hartford Community Coalition.  Established in 
2014 in response to the tragic loss of three young people to 
suicide in one summer, members of the greater Hartford 
community stepped forward and created a grassroots 
organization. The main mission of the Coalition is a simple but 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
31 
 
 
 
powerful intention to create the time and space needed to 
facilitate community-wide conversations and action. The 
Coalition has evolved into a network of partnerships with 
organizations already present in the community to help 
community members seeking to create solutions.  The Coalition 
hosts the annual Hartford Block Party which includes dozens of 
Hartford organizations and draws 700-800 people.   
 
Medical Facilities and Services.  Local medical establishments 
include a number of doctors’ offices, and the Good Neighbor 
Health Clinic – a walk-in medical and dental clinic for low 
income residents located in the former Gates Library in White 
River Junction.   
 
The Veterans Administration Medical Center (VA Hospital)7 
in White River Junction serves 73,000 Vermont and New 
Hampshire veterans, and is one of Hartford’s largest employers, 
with 1400 full-time employees.  Excluding doctors, 90% of the 
center’s employees are veterans.   There are an estimated 600 
people onsite during the day, including staff, a contingent of 
federal police, patients and other caregivers.  
 
The VA Medical Center includes a 74-bed acute care facility that 
provides a full range of medical and psychiatric care, including 
a resident substance abuse treatment program.   The center is

Management Coordinator, March 18, 2013. 
also classified as a federal “Level II” facility, with four fully 
equipped operating suites.  The center is affiliated with several 
other medical and academic institutions, including the Geisel 
School of Medicine (formerly the Dartmouth Medical School) 
and the University of Vermont College of Medicine. 
 
The medical center campus is located on a 64-acre hillside 
overlooking I-89, well above the floodplain.   It includes a 
hospital building, a 47,000 square foot research building, an 
ambulatory care building and administrative and clinical 
support buildings.   There are six generators on-site, including 
one to run emergency facilities and five in individual buildings.  
The generators are on a looped system so that if one or two 
malfunctions, they will still provide needed emergency power.  
There is enough fuel stored on site to last one month.  It’s 
estimated that the center can accommodate 500 people easily, 
with food water and beds, for 96 hours (as required for this type 
of federal facility).  Cots are also available for staff use.    
 
The center also has the ability to evacuate if needed, but is 
required to prepare for and maintain uninterrupted service 
during a disaster.  Under a federally-declared disaster it also has 
the ability to care for others if requested.  The center is currently 
designated by the state as a way station or hub for the 
evacuation of area nursing homes – to serve as a staging center 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

and provide care until residents can be assigned and moved to 
other facilities.  
 
Available communications systems include three satellite 
phones, an amateur radio tower (part of the standby Vermont 
Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service), and radio equipment 
provided to the Hartford Fire Department under an active and 
ongoing relationship with the department. 
 
The center regularly practices emergency response, following 
“joint commission” standards related to Medicare and Medicaid.  
Exercises are conducted twice yearly – one of which includes a 
full evacuation.  The center also has conducted an anthrax 
release exercise with the US Postal Distribution Center in White 
River Junction.  This included setting up a decontamination site 
at the hospital – using the Hartford Fire Department’s 
decontamination unit – for those in need of decontamination 
and medical attention.   
 
Parks and Recreation.  In addition to the state park at Quechee 
Gorge, the Town of Hartford maintains seventeen public 
municipal parks and recreation facilities, as listed in Appendix 
B and shown on the accompanying map.  This includes several 
riverside parks that were heavily damaged by Tropical Storm 
Irene and required restoration, including: 
 
 
Erwin Clifford Park, West Hartford   
 
Quechee Green Park, Quechee 
 
Watson Memorial Park, Hartford Village 
 
George Ratfcliff Park, White River Junction

33 
 
 
 
 
Lyman Park, White River Junction 
 
Maxfield Sports Fields, White River Junction 
 
Two parks – Kilowatt Park South in Wilder and the Hurricane 
Forest Wildlife Refuge at the Wright Reservoir– are located at 
dam sites, but weren’t impacted by the flood.  In 2015, Wright’s 
Reservoir was drained pending a decision by the community on 
whether to reconstruct the dam or not.     
  
Flood recovery related to hazard mitigation resulted in the 
acquisition of additional town park land through the federal 
buyout program – including land adjoining the West Hartford 
Library and land next to the Quechee Covered Bridge.  Under 
FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program, the federal 
government covers 75% of the cost buying severely damaged or 
destroyed properties identified by the town and state for 
acquisition.  Individuals cannot apply for direct assistance, but 
the town can apply on their behalf.  Property acquisition 
through the program is one of the most permanent forms of 
hazard mitigation – it forever removes people and property 
from harm’s way.  Once a property is acquired it must be 
cleared, and retained as open land, for public use.  It cannot be 
sold privately or redeveloped.     
 
Cultural Facilities and Resources.    Hartford is fortunate to 
have a variety of cultural facilities and resources that contribute 
to the town’s historic identity and character, its unique sense of 
place, its economic development, and the cultural life of local 
residents.  
 
Hartford is one of sixteen Certified Local Governments (CLGs) in 
the state eligible to receive state funding for historic 
preservation and has a very active Historic Preservation 
Commission.  National Register listings to date – due in larger 
part to local efforts – include more than 500 structures, many of 
which are contributing structures in the following listed historic 
districts: 
 
 White River Junction Historic District (1980)  
 Quechee Mill Historic District (1997) 
 Hartford Village Historic District (1998) 
 Wilder Village Historic District (1999) 
 Jericho Rural Historic District, Jericho (2001) 
 Taftsville Historic District (2001)  
 White River Junction Historic District Expansion (2002) 
 Christian Street Historic District, Wilder (2003) 
 West Hartford Village District (2004) 
 Terraces Historic District (2013) 
 Advent Camp Meeting Grounds (2017) 
 White River Junction Historic District Expansion (2019) 
 
Some buildings within three of these districts – White River 
Junction, Quechee Mill, and West Hartford – are located in the 
mapped 100-year flood zone There are also thirteen historic 
cemeteries scattered throughout the town, dating back to the 
18th century.  
 
Historically, Hartford has relied on village libraries to serve its 
residents. Each of the five villages once had their own library. 
That changed in 2001 when the Gates Memorial Library in 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
34 
 
 
 
White River Junction closed and became a medical clinic. Of the 
remaining four libraries, the West Hartford Library is the only 
town-owned facility with an elected Board of Trustees. The 
Quechee Library, Hartford Library, and the Wilder Club and 
Library are operated by private nonprofit organizations with 
their own separate board of directors, but each library receives 
some town funding.  As noted earlier, the West Hartford Library 
was heavily damaged by Irene flooding but was rehabilitated, 
including elevation and flood-proofing.

has 
re-
established itself as a

part through the adaptive

contribute to the vitality of 
the downtown, serve as local gathering places, and provide a 
variety of cultural opportunities for local residents and the 
greater Upper Valley. 
V.  RISK & VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  
 
A risk assessment evaluates the potential for damage, loss or 
other impacts from anticipated hazards. A vulnerability 
assessment tries to predict the damage or loss to community 
assets that may result from a hazard event.  These assessments, 
which may take many forms, are used to rank and prioritize 
anticipated risks – to inform local decision-making and to 
develop associated mitigation measures.  
Available state, county and local information was used to 
identify natural and manmade hazards to be considered in 
local hazard mitigation planning.  This information, along 
with community concerns and insights based on recent 
events and local emergency planning, was then used to 
identify and rank local hazards, as summarized in Appendix 
C, and as referenced in related risk assessments (by hazard 
type) that were used in developing associated mitigation 
strategies.   
HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION 
State Hazards Ranking.  Vermont Emergency Management has 
identified and ranked both natural and “technological” or 
manmade hazards for purposes of state hazard mitigation 
planning, as included in the November 2018 State of Vermont 
State Hazard Mitigation Plan (VHMP).  The state list was used to 
develop an initial list of hazards for  
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

consideration in updating the town’s hazard mitigation plan, 
with a focus on those higher frequency hazards identified for 
regional and local consideration.  The state plan identifies major 
risks by “specific jurisdiction” – defined for this purpose as 
regional planning commission areas.  State Hazards List 
(Ranked). 
Inundation Flooding and 
fluvial erosion are identified 
as high-risk hazards specific 
to 
the 
Two-Rivers 
Ottauquechee 
Region 
– 
especially 
given 
that 
Windsor County has the 
highest number of reported 
flood-related events and 
FEMA disaster declarations 
in the state.  Flooding and 
fluvial erosion is listed as 
the number one hazard in 
the VHMP. Winter storms, 
technological hazards and 
hazardous materials spills 
pose moderate risks. Given 
that this region has not 
experienced significant development within the past 10 years, 
the state has determined that the overall level of risk from 
flooding and winter storms remains unchanged.  Hartford is not

identified as a high risk “SFHA Community” in the state’s 
vulnerability assessment.   
Climate change is not identified in the state plan as a hazard per 
se, but the plan does acknowledge that Vermont’s warming 
climate is expected to exacerbate existing hazards – including 
the frequency and severity of weather-related hazards (e.g., 
flooding, fluvial erosion, landslides, ice jams), and to contribute 
to emerging hazards, including waterborne and infectious 
diseases.   
 
County-Level Data. Most federal information regarding past 
hazard events is available only at the county level.  As such,  
information specific to Windsor County was used to identify and 
evaluate the type, frequency and relative impact of past events 
within the larger Hartford region, which could therefore be 
expected to affect the community in the future.  
 
According to FEMA, there were nineteen federally-declared 
major disasters for Windsor County between 1969 and 2020 – 
averaging about one every three years – though not all impacted 
Hartford directly.   As indicated in Table 5.1, the majority of 
declared disasters was due to flooding or other types of severe 
storms. Most recently, and one that has never before been 
declared for, was the pandemic COVID-19 (or coronavirus). At 
the time that this Plan was being written, it is still unknown the 
total impacts that COVID-19 had on Hartford, the state, and the 
country.  
 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) compiles storm events data, dating from 1950 to 
present.  For the purposes of this HMP, storm events from 2000 
and onward were analyzed. These cover “regional” weather 
events for the larger Windsor County area (National Weather 
Service Forecast Zone) for periods of cold/wind chill, extreme 
cold/ wind chill, flash flood, flood, frost/freeze, hail, heat, heavy 
snow, high wind, strong wind, thunderstorm wind, winter 
storm, and winter weather.  Over this 20-year reporting period, 
246 reported regional storm events (averaging around 12 per 
year) were catalogued – including nine events specific to 
Hartford.  In some cases, several events are reported for the 
same storm system.   Database entries also include more general

estimates of related property and crop damage – totaling $5 
million over this twenty-year period.  
 
As expected, the majority of recorded regional events relate to 
winter storms and winter weather, while the majority of more 
localized events are associated with severe thunderstorms (to 
include wind, heavy rain, and hail).   In addition to flooding and 
flash flooding, storm-related hazards include high winds, with 
estimated gusts ranging from 35 to 50 knots (40 to 60 miles per 
hour) and hail up to 1.75 inches. Hazards related to cold 
temperatures – including unseasonal frosts, and periods of 
extreme cold during winter months – are more common than 
heat spells; however, five heat-related events have been 
reported since 2006, including dry spells in 2011 and 2012 that 
resulted in some crop damage. The heat wave on 2011 resulted 
in one death in Windsor County.  
 
These analyses confirm that, with regard to frequency, winter 
weather and severe storm events are responsible for most  
hazardous conditions at the town and county level; however, 
flooding – including flash flooding and fluvial (stream bank) 
erosion – by far results in the most damage to property and 
crops, even when damages from Irene are not included.     
 
Locally Identified Hazards. A local history of hazard events 
was compiled from community forums, town documents and 
interviews with town and state officials. For identified hazards, 
local knowledge generally confirms and augments state and 
county-level information.  
 
Given the impacts of Tropical Storm Irene on Hartford and 
Vermont, there is understandably a strong focus at both the 
local and state level on mitigating hazards associated with 
flooding.  The town has also long recognized and prepared for 
the fact that the community faces a broad range of potential 
natural and man-made hazards.  
 
Identified hazards were ranked according to geographic extent, 
probability (based on past frequency), and level of impact using 
a version of the state’s ranking criteria adapted for local use 
(Appendix C).  Hazards were also ranked for local mitigation 
planning purposes by those attending public meetings and 
filling out the community survey (Appendix D).   
 
• 
The top natural hazards that respondents have 
experienced while living in Hartford include severe 
summer and winter weather, flooding, high winds, and 
erosion.  
• 
The top man-made (technical) hazards that respondents 
have experienced while living in Hartford include 
structural fires and school safety incidents.  
• 
When asked what hazards may impact respondents in 
the next five years, common responses included 
pandemic, severe weather (including heavy rain), and 
hazardous materials incidents.  
 
The results indicate that, though many of the hazards identified 
by the state could potentially affect Hartford, with regard to 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
38 
 
 
 
losses to property and major impacts to human health and 
safety the five top hazards facing the community are: 
 
 
Flooding and fluvial erosion (includes flash flooding 
from thunderstorms, hurricanes/tropical storms, ice 
jams, and dam failure), 
 
Severe winter storms, 
 
Pandemic 
 
Hazardous materials, and  
 
Structural fires.  
 
Except for a pandemic, these are consistent with hazards 
identified for mitigation in the previous Hartford HMP.  
 
Drought, hail, landslide, lightning, and severe thunderstorm and 
winds were classed as moderate natural hazards. There are no 
mitigation actions proposed for drought, hail, or lightning. The 
flooding effects of severe thunderstorms are covered under 
floods, and the wind effects under severe wind. Landslide 
hazards, identified in the previous HMP as “probable and 
damaging” are also considered for mitigation in Section 6 below; 
but, because past damage has been highly localized and partially 
addressed (Pomfret Road, Jericho Road/Country Lane), and the 
full extent of local risk remains undocumented, landslide risks 
were ranked as moderate.  This is also true for high wind events, 
which do occur, but are highly localized and have resulted in 
minimal damage.   
Of less concern as natural hazards are natural brushfire (as 
these are rare), earthquake (very rare), extreme temperatures 
(heat may become more of an issue in the future), invasive 
species (minor damage, although this will be watched as tree 
pests such as emerald ash borer may arrive), and tornado 
(unlikely). Natural hazards such as volcanoes and tsunamis are 
simply not applicable. 
 
The hazards of highest concern, and related risks and 
community vulnerabilities, are described in more detail as 
follows.  
FLOODING AND FLUVIAL EROSION 
Flooding.  Flooding can happen at any time of the year, but 
historically has resulted from ice jams and snowmelt runoff in 
the spring, and severe storms in late summer and fall.  The most 
widespread and damaging floods – including the November 
1927 flood and Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011 – have all 
been associated with hurricanes or tropical storms tracking up 
the northeast coast.  In each case heavy rainfall, on top of already 
saturated soil conditions, resulted in very large volumes of 
runoff over a short period of time.     
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
39 
 
 
 
The magnitude and impact of flooding from Tropical Storm 
Irene in 2011 rivaled and potentially exceeded that of the 1927 
flood. The White River, which flows into the Connecticut River 
at White River Junction, has a total drainage area of 712 square 
miles (1,840 sq. km.).  During Irene the river basin received, on 
average, more than six inches of rain, resulting in a peak 
discharge of 90,100 cubic feet per second, as measured at the 
West Hartford gauge station before it stopped transmitting data.   
The river at West Hartford crested at 28.36 feet – more than 10 
feet above flood stage. 
 
Local damage from Irene was extensive, FEMA aid accounted for 
$5,680,017. Municipal properties and infrastructure damaged 
from flooding and bank erosion included five local parks, 
municipal water and sewer systems, and local roads, bridges 
and culverts. Roads washed out in more than sixty locations; 
and the West Hartford and Quechee bridges both suffered 
extensive damage.   Emergency and temporary infrastructure 
repairs completed through January 
 
2012 totaled $1,534,000.  The cost of remaining repairs at that 
time was estimated at more than $4 million.  Many homes and 
businesses – including the West Hartford library, post office and 
village store – also flooded. Private property losses were also 
then estimated at more than $4 million. 8   Most permanent 
repair work is now complete – though as noted earlier, the town

is continuing to pursue property buyouts under the federal 
hazard mitigation grant program, and to renovated both the 
Hartford Municipal Building and the West Hartford Library.

Flood Impacts:

entire valley in some areas resulting in widespread, devastating 
damage.  Homes and businesses near the river will be 
inundated; some may be swept off their foundations.  Portions 
of Routes 14 and 107 will be covered and may be damaged or 
destroyed. 
 
18 Feet – Route 14 west of West Hartford will be flooded; 
widespread field flooding in the White River valley. 
 
Ice Jams.  Spring flooding due to ice jams, though not nearly as 
devastating, is a much more frequent occurrence – and 
sometimes also very destructive.   According to historical 
accounts, spring floods on the White River have been an annual 
occurrence.  The “Great Flood of 1867” caused by an ice jam on 
the White River, combined with February rain and runoff, 
destroyed the bridge and many homes and businesses in West 
Hartford, and resulted in one death.9    
 
Since then, 52 accounts of ice jams in Hartford have been 
compiled in the ice jam database maintained by the US Army’s 
Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), 
based 
in 
Hanover,

majority (63%) occurring on the White River between West 
Hartford and White River Junction.

Ice jams along the White River frequently result in minor 
flooding, temporary road closures and bank erosion.  They 
cause more damage during periods of high water. The most 
destructive jams reported since 1867 have occurred at the 
confluence of the White and Connecticut Rivers – including jams 
that took out the Bridge Street Bridge on US 5 across the White 
River in 1964, and again in 1990. The bridge was replaced in 
1992 with cells to monitor ice loading.  The 1990 jam also 
temporarily closed the Hartford Village bridge (since replaced).  
Ice and flash flooding in 1964 blocked off both entrances to 
White River Junction from Route 14, and damaged several

houses and businesses, resulting in $1.2 million in damages to 
roads and bridges, and $1.9 million in damages to private 
property.  
 
Ice jams on the Connecticut River are much less frequent (17%), 
based on available reports, but tend to form in the vicinity of 
White River Junction at the confluence of the White River, in the 
vicinity of the I-89 bridge.  When jams do occur, flash flooding is 
a real concern. A 1970 jam on the Connecticut flooded several 
commercial buildings, and raised backwater at the Wilder Dam. 
 
 
10 Interview with Allyn Ricker, Hartford Town Highway 
Superintendent, March 19, 2013. 
Ice jams on the Ottauquechee (19%) occasionally result in 
flooding behind the Quechee Club House.  A 1972 jam destroyed 
the golf course bridge; a 1992 jam flooded and damaged 
portions of the Lakeland Golf Course, delaying its opening for 
the season.  There is also a history of ice jams on Main Street, 
east of the intersection with Old Quechee Road. 
 
Over the years the town has taken measures to reduce the 
impacts of ice jams and flash flooding in areas particularly prone 
to flooding – including Quechee Main Street and Route 14, and 
the River Road near the Taftsville Bridge.  Work completed in 
2007 and after Irene to 
build up the River Road 
has 
reduced 
the 
amount of flooding in 
this area.10

(including the Wilder Dam on the Connecticut), and two dams 
owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers, constructed in part 
for flood control.  Only one of the dams listed – the Wright  
 
Reservoir Dam owned by the town – is rated as having a 
significant hazard potential.  This is based on the potential 
extent of downstream impacts in the event of a failure, and not 
the current condition of the dam.  A significant hazard is one that 
will likely result in little loss of life, but appreciable potential 
economic loss (e.g., to commercial structures). Due to the 
designation, the reservoir was drained in 2015 and is pending a 
decision by the Town whether to breach the dam or reconstruct 
it. Since the reservoir has been emptied, only a very exceptional 
rain event would both fill it and breach the dam. 
 
The Wright Reservoir served as a municipal water supply.  It 
borders the 142-acre Hurricane Forest Wildlife Refuge, and has 
served as an important town recreational resource.  The earthen 
reservoir dam, constructed in 1930 on a tributary of the 
Connecticut River, is 330 feet long and 36 feet high.  The 
impounded reservoir has a surface area of around three acres.    
 
An inundation map has not been located but, in the event of a 
dam failure, the surge of water could impact the Wright 
Reservoir Road, I-89 and commercial properties along US 5 
located below the dam.  The town contracted with an 
engineering firm to complete a design for full rehabilitation of 
the Wright Reservoir Dam.  
 
 Fluvial Erosion.   Fluvial erosion – erosion caused by rivers and 
streams – ranges from gradual streambank erosion to

catastrophic changes in the location and dimensions of a river 
channel during a major flood event.  The majority of damage 
caused by flooding in Vermont – and locally – is due to fluvial 
erosion associated with flash flooding – especially outside of 
FEMA-mapped floodplains, which indicate only potential 
inundation areas based on calculated flood heights.    
 
Fluvial erosion is also a major cause of landslides in Vermont.  
Following Irene, two “cliff hanger” properties in Quechee 
damaged by fluvial erosion– both on Waterman Hill Road – were 
bought out at a total cost of $473,998 (VHMP, p.4-91).   River 
channel erosion in Quechee also undermined municipal 
infrastructure under the river bed, requiring major stream 
channel repair work following Irene. 
 
Given the known hazards and costs associated with fluvial 
erosion, the state is in the process of mapping river corridors  
that are highly susceptible to fluvial erosion.  This work is 
expected to be completed in 2014.  Once maps are available, the 
The White River Tactical Basin Plan (VANR July 2013), which 
covers the Lower White River through Hartford, includes state 
recommendations and actions to protect, maintain and improve 
river water quality and habitat by managing activities that 
cause 
known 
stressors. 
Key 
recommendations 
include 
minimizing floodplain encroachments, and to implement flood 
restoration projects that connect the river channel to its 
floodplain, and to protect targeted river corridors.  Actions 
specific to Hartford include: 

Map and prioritize floodplain encroachment parcels for 
possible removal/restoration, based on … fluvial erosion 
hazards and past flood damage, with a focus on developed 
floodplains in village centers (West Hartford). 

Complete discharge and stormwater mapping inventories 
and plans, and implement related report recommendations 
(Hartford/White River Junction). 

Undertake green infrastructure demonstration projects 
(Hartford/White River Junction). 

Provide outreach to municipalities regarding stormwater 
zoning and bylaws (Hartford/White River Junction). 

Provide technical assistance to towns in implementing high 
priority stormwater best management practices (Hartford/ 
White River Junction). 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT

state is strongly recommending that municipalities adopt fluvial 
erosion hazard area (river corridor) bylaws, in addition to flood 
hazard bylaws, to further limit development and minimize 
associated risks within known hazard areas.   
 
Flood Risk Assessment.   The initial risk assessment included 
in the 2008 Hartford Annex of the Regional PDM plan identified 
47 residences and 17 commercial businesses within the mapped 
100-year floodplain which were vulnerable to potential 
flooding, having a total estimated value of $20,778,167.11   At the 
time, this represented 1% of the town’s total grand list.   
 
 The assessment was updated in 
2013 by Hartford town staff 
using maps provided by the 
regional 
commission 
that 
showed 
structures 
located 
within Special Flood Hazard 
Areas (SFHAs) identified on 
current Flood Insurance Rate 
Maps (FIRMs).  The results are 
presented in Table 5.3.   The 
maps on the next page identify 
structures within the SFHAs.   
 
 
11 A similar but less detailed analysis from Ned Swanberg, Vermont 
Flood Hazard Mapping Coordinator (June 2013), identified 69 
Overall, there was very little identified risk in 2014. A total of 75 
properties (principal structures) were identified within the 
mapped floodplain (1% chance of flooding) – representing 1.6% 
of all principal structures in town.  Less than 1% of the town’s 
residential properties are located in the mapped floodplain – 
however nearly 5% of the town’s commercial properties – and 
50% of industrial properties – are vulnerable to flooding.   Five 
public buildings – including the Hartford Town Hall in White 
River Junction, and the West Hartford Library in West Hartford 
– are located in the mapped floodplain.  Other community assets 
and areas of local concern identified in the floodplain include: 
structures and 70 “families” in the mapped Special Flood Hazard Area 
– including four in the mapped floodway.

The total listed value of properties at risk of 
flooding, including outbuildings, exceeds 
$18.6 million.   As noted for the previous 
assessment, this does not reflect structures 
that could be damaged from flash flooding 
and fluvial erosion that are more likely to 
occur outside of mapped flood hazard areas. 
 
According to information supplied by the 
Flood Ready Vermont, as of April 2020, there 
are 70 buildings in the Special Flood Hazard 
Area (SFHA), of these there are 28 policies for 
structures within the mapped flood hazard 
area (40%) – for a total insured value of 
$14,532,500.  Current flood insurance 
policies for older (pre-FIRM) structures in 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
46 
 
 
 
Hartford run around $1,400 for $139,000 of insured value, 
while the cost of policies for newer structures is roughly twice 
that amount.  Since 1978 only one substantial damage claim was 
filed in Hartford – there have been no repetitive loss claims.12 
Many structures have had uninsured losses, though, and several 
were destroyed in Irene.  
 Local insurance rates increased significantly under the federal 
Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), 
which affected its affordability for homes and businesses.  This 
legislation called on the FEMA Program to raise insurance rates 
under the National Flood Insurance Program to reflect true 
flood risk and to make the program more financially stable. 
  
Community Vulnerabilities.  Community forums held in 
association with updating the plan in 2014 highlighted both 
perceived community vulnerabilities and lessons learned 
following Tropical Storm Irene.  The results of these forums are 
still applicable and summarized in Appendix D.   Of particular 
note: 
 
 
Some neighborhoods, and West Hartford in particular, were 
cut off and isolated from the rest of the town – one West 
Hartford household took in and fed 17 people for several 
days.  Others slept in their cars. This suggests the need for 
additional communication and warning systems, evacuation 
options, and temporary shelters in outer villages and those 
 
12 Ned Swanberg, Flood Hazard Mapping Coordinator, Vermont 
Watershed Management Division, June 25, 2013. 
areas accessed via bridges.  Emergency planning should 
consider multiple access and evacuation routes and 
collection points, in coordination with other trail groups, 
such as VAST. 
 
 
Municipal staff that manage and coordinate emergency 
response do not live in town, and may be unable to get to 
town if roads and bridges are cut off during a major disaster. 
 
 
The town’s senior population – particularly those living 
alone – are especially vulnerable during a major disaster 
(this issue has also arisen in the pandemic).  It’s not clear 
whether seniors and others with critical medical needs are 
registered with local authorities.  Access to senior housing 
in White River Junction could also be cut off, making 
evacuation –e.g., to the Senior Center or the VA Hospital – 
difficult. 
 
 
Debris collected at the West Hartford Bridge, apparently 
contributing to flooding in the village – though relatively 
new - local residents are concerned that the bridge is 
undersized for its location. However, this bridge will not be 
replaced for several decades. Many road and driveway 
culverts are also undersized, which contributed to flooding, 
road and driveway washouts.  Local road standards and 
stormwater management systems have been updated and 
improved.    
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
Temporary housing or shelters are also needed for animals, 
including farm livestock and people’s pets.  The high school 
shelter doesn’t have adequate space for pets, particularly 
when school is in session, and allergies are a concern.  The 
suggestion was made to provide a separate trailer with 
cages for pets on the school property, so that pets can be 
sheltered near their owners.   
 
 
Provisions are needed for hikers coming off the Appalachian 
Trail through West Hartford during a major disaster. 
 
 
 More public education and information, improved 
administrative 
structures, 
and 
better 
notice 
and 
communications systems are needed to plan for, respond to 
and recover from a major disaster.   
 
A number of local businesses were also affected by Irene – 
highlighting the need to target outreach, planning and resources 
to the local business community to better plan for, respond to 
and recover from future disasters (this has also been made clear 
in the current pandemic). The Small Business Development 
Center located in Hartford has prepared a “Disaster Resilient 
Business Checklist” and handbook for use by local businesses, 
which include recommendations to obtain flood insurance and 
to store backup files offsite. 
 
With Irene well behind the town, it is still prevalent in the minds 
of residents. Recent community meetings for the 2020 update of 
the HMP plan still stated that Irene weighed heavily on future 
mitigation efforts that the town can undertake. A community 
survey was sent out (full results in Appendix XX) in March 2020 
to obtain feedback from residents on what hazards have 
affected them, and what mitigation efforts the town should take 
on. Culver and road upgrades (83.7%) and improving natural 
stormwater management (79.1%) were among the highest 
rated mitigation efforts the town should take on.  
SEVERE WINTER STORMS 
Description.  Winter storms are a common occurrence locally 
and throughout the region, given Vermont’s northern climate.  
Average winter temperatures fall well below freezing – and 
often below 0° F in January and February. The lowest 
temperature of record for the town was -34°F, reached in 
January 2000.  The town, on average, receives around 66 inches 
of snow per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout 
the winter months.  The maximum snowfall on record was 30 
inches.  Severe winter storms – characterized by heavier than 
normal snow, sleet, or freezing rain, extensive icing and snow 
drifts, strong winds and extreme cold – occur less frequently, 
and can cause considerably more damage. 
 
Extent/Previous Occurrences.  Based on reported events, 
Windsor County averages around 8 to 10 winter storms per year 
that may result in some damage (NOAA, SHELDUS).  There has 
been only one winter storm in recent history, however, that 
resulted in a major disaster declaration – the Ice Storm of 1998 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
48 
 
 
 
– which affected much of Vermont, including higher elevation 
areas in Hartford (Jericho area). 
 
Winter weather often results in temporary road closures, school 
and business delays, and brief power outages.  Given the 
frequency of winter storms, the town and local residents are 
generally well prepared and equipped to deal with normal 
winter weather conditions.  Severe winter storms, however, 
affect the entire region as well as the local community, and may 
result in: 
 
 
Extensive damage to above-ground power and utility 
lines, and extended power outages (as in 1998), 
 
Road, airport and rail shutdowns, making general travel, 
transport and emergency vehicle access difficult, 
 
Business and school closures and government shut-
downs, limiting access to goods and services, 
 
Structural failure from excessive snow loading – 
especially affecting barns and other large structures, 
 
Injuries and fatalities – from poor driving conditions 
(accidents), extreme cold (frostbite, hypothermia), and 
overexertion (back injuries, heart attacks). 
 
Risk and Vulnerability Assessment.  No information specific 
to Hartford is available for a detailed analysis of risk, but winter 
storms at the county level result in roughly $38,000 in damages 
per storm event, or $264,000 per year, averaged over a 50-year 
reporting period (SHELDUS).   Green Mountain Power has 
identified wind and wet snow/ice events as increasing and 
causing more frequent power outages.  
 
Winter road maintenance costs also make up a significant 
portion of the local highway budget.  Facilities and 
infrastructure especially at risk from severe winter storms 
include the town’s highways and bridges, and overhead utility 
and transmission lines.  Local residents especially at risk 
include: 
 
 
the local homeless population, 
 
senior residents – and especially those living alone, 
 
households who rely solely on electric heat, 
 
low income households in need of fuel assistance, 
 
residents with critical medical needs, including medical 
support equipment, and  
 
residents living in remote locations, making access 
difficult.  
PANDEMICS 
Description. While not an entirely new hazard for Hartford, 
recent events related to COVID-19 (the illness caused by a 
novel coronavirus) has made pandemics of particular concern 
for the town and the state. The scale and complexity of COVID-
19 has not been seen in this country since the 1918 Spanish 
Flu. With a major pandemic, the hazard to Hartford is its effect 
on individuals, vulnerable populations, the medical system, 
and the economy. While this hazard is the number one issue 
facing the town right now, the current evolving situation 
makes it impossible at this time fully understand and capture 
in this HMP the short and long-term impacts on the Town  
 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
49 
 
 
 
On March 25, 2020, Governor Scott enacted a ‘Stay Home, Stay 
Safe’ order that essentially closed all but essential businesses, 
required companies to work from home if they can, and to 
reduce trips outside the home to limit human-to-human 
contact. On April 10, 2020, this order was extended to last until 
May 15, 2020, and as of the writing of this plan restrictions on 
travel and businesses are being lessened as case activity 
remains very low and medical capacity is much more then 
needed at the moment.  
 
There are current untold economic impacts to this order for 
the town and the state, including a massive spike in 
unemployment and severe drops in tax revenue. It is not clear 
how long these impacts will continue, but most forecast for 
there to be economic and revenue shortfalls at least until 2021. 
As of the writing of this plan, the health impacts have not been 
as severe as anticipated, likely due to the orders for isolation, 
but there have been nearly 1,000cases in the state and 55 
deaths. 
 
COVID-19 has made it clear that in major pandemics that affect 
most of the population, the current medical system is largely 
inadequate to handle a surge of caseloads and hospitalizations. 
Vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes and prisons, 
have been particularly hard hit due to close living quarters. In 
Hartford, there are several nursing homes and elderly housing 
that are at high risk for death due to COVID-19. While not 
completely overwhelmed at the time of this writing, the VA 
Medical Center has expressed that they would be maxed out if 
a majority of patients who are eligible for care contract the 
disease.  
 
Risk and Vulnerability Assessment. Since this situation is 
currently ongoing, there are no specific lists or dollar amounts 
that explain the impact COVID-19 is having on the town, or on 
the region/state.  
 
Populations that are currently high risk for pandemics include: 
• 
nursing homes 
• 
elderly housing 
• 
school populations 
• 
individuals 60 and over, and 
• 
individuals with pre-existing health conditions 
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENTS/SPILLS 
 
Description.  Hartford – and White River Junction in particular 
– is located at the junction of major highway and rail corridors 
serving the region.   Significant loads of material, including 
hazardous materials, are transported through town on a daily 
basis.   Interstates 89 and 91, Routes 4, 5 and 14, two rail lines 
and the rail yard in White River Junction handle most 
commercial traffic.  The release of hazardous materials in 
association with a traffic or rail accident is a major concern 
locally.   
 
There have been train derailments in Hartford– including the 
largest train accident in Vermont’s history, occurring in 
February 1887, when an express passenger train headed to 
Montreal jumped the tracks and plunged into the White River 
resulting in thirty-one deaths.   
 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
50 
 
 
 
A more recent derailment, in August 2008, involved six New 
England Central cars.  There were no reported spills or injuries, 
but the accident closed the tracks for more than six hours, and 
Amtrak passengers had to be bussed to their destinations.    
 
The Federal Transportation Agency does not require manifests 
for unfixed facilities (i.e. trains). Hartford’s Fire Chief has 
acknowledged that they don’t know what’s traveling through 
town or stored in the rail yard, which makes it difficult to plan 
in advance – but noted that the most common material is likely 
propane, supplying Irving Fuels – large shipments reportedly 
come through about every three days.  In an emergency the fire 
department relies on the placards attached to rail cars or trucks, 
and available shipping manifests, to identify materials being 
transported.   
 
From 2017-2019, TRORC conducted a state-wide hazardous 
materials commodity flow study. This study worked to track 
and identify what types of hazardous materials are traveling on 
Vermont’s roads, railways, and airways. Individual Hartford 
information 
can 
be 
found 
at 
https://www.trorc.org/programs/emergency/vt-commodity-
flow-study/. Generally, the majority of hazardous materials that 
travel on Hartford’s roads and railways are fossil fuels, such as 
propane, gasoline, and diesel fuel.  
 
Additionally, spills can happen at a facility that uses hazardous 
chemicals. As of 2019 Hartford is home to forty Tier II facilities. 
Tier II facilities are fixed facilities that house a certain amount 
of hazardous materials, these thresholds are determined by the 
EPA and the State of Vermont. Tier II facilities can include gas 
stations, solid waste facilities, DPW garages, and water/waste 
water treatment plants. These facilities can be a risk to area 
residents if a fire were to occur. Annually, these facilities are 
required to report their hazardous materials quantities to the 
state, local fire department, and to LEPC#12.  
 
Risk and Vulnerability Assessment.  As reported in the 2008 
Hartford Annex and 2014 HMP, within 1,000 feet of the railroad 
tracks, Routes 4 and 5, and Interstates 89 and 91 there are 2,442

residences and 357 commercial and industrial buildings, 
including three critical facilities: 
 
 
VA Medical Center 
 
Three schools 
 
Hartford Police/Fire Station 
 
Staff at the White River School in particular expressed concern 
about potential hazardous material spills, given how close the 
rail line is to the school.  The Hartford Superintendent of Schools 
agreed that a community exercise around a chemical spill 
should be conducted.    
 
At community meetings, New England Central was given high 
marks for running a good operation – it was also noted that rails, 
crossings and signals have recently been improved.  That said, 
there was concern that rail lines continued to stage tankers in 
White River Junction near populated buildings and the school. 
The Upper Valley Food Co-op, an important community 
gathering place, is also located near sided rail cars, some of 
which may be hauling propane and other hazardous materials.  
 
VA Hospital staff also expressed concern regarding accidental 
chemical releases, given their proximity to the intersection of 
two interstate highways and the rail line.   For past training 
exercises they have relied on use of the Hartford Fire 
Department’s decontamination unit.  
 
 
FIRE HAZARDS 
 
Description. The Hartford Fire Department regularly responds 
to both structural and brush fires; of the two, structural fires are 
more of a concern given the potential loss, damage, injury and 
fatalities that that may result. 
 
Historically (from 2010 through 2019), a total of 79 brush 
fires were reported, averaging 9 each year.  Main causes 
reported were typically human-caused in the spring when 
people are cleaning their yards and as a result of downed 
powerlines.   Loss from brush fires have historically been 
low. Small brush fires occur on a regular basis – including the 
2010 fire in West Hartford shown below – but result in little if 
any real damage.

HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
52 
 
 
 
 
Risk and Vulnerability Assessment.  Over the years, 
structural fires have destroyed many of Hartford’s historic 
buildings, including two hotels located at the present site of the 
Hotel Coolidge.   Several of the town’s first industrial and 
railroad buildings in White River Junction also were lost in a 
large fire in 1860. In 2017, a major fire destroyed several 
buildings in the Harrison Avenue Industrial Park.   
 
Given the concentration of population, higher density 
residential development and large wooden structures in 
Hartford’s historic villages, the Hartford Fire Department 
performed a risk analysis and identified major structural fire 
risks by geographic area in its emergency operations plan.  
Buildings posing a special fire risk identified by the department 
include:

In addition to these top hazards, the Hartford Selectboard 
wanted discussion in this Plan pertaining to other hazards and 
their affect on the town.  
 
Resilience 
Resilience is the ability to withstand a hazard, and bounce 
back, preferably to a state that is less likely to suffer as much 
from that same hazard in the future. Mitigation actions are 
integral to resilience, as they lessen the likelihood of the 
hazard having as serious a consequence in the future. These 
are mainly structural measures, such as upsizing culverts. 
Other forms of resilience include creating better community 
communication and cohesion so that the social and economic 
effects of a disaster do not widen divisions but rather are met 
with a stronger community response. Hartford has a standing 
committee dedicated to this aspect of emergency management 
and increased internal and external communication and 
coordination so that as disasters arise there is less likelihood of 
friction and more of working together to solve problems. 
 
Cost-Benefit 
Mitigation actions are tested through a rough cost-benefit 
examination, or a more formal one. Cost-benefit analyses look 
at the costs of the fix, and compare it to the cost of the damage. 
To get some FEMA mitigation funds, a project has to have more 
current value than its cost. The idea is that fixes that are 
cheaper to do than suffer repeated repairs are cost-beneficial. 
Some projects just make common sense, but others require 
having some knowledge of damage frequency and the cost of 
repairs, versus a more robust mitigation action and its costs 
and savings over time. Typically, frequent small damages 
create a better return on mitigation than rare expensive ones, 
largely due to the concept of 'net-present value' which 
attempts to reduce all the distance future savings to a current 
value to weigh against mitigation costs now. Hazards that are 
unlikely have those future benefits discounted heavily. This is a 
reason that keeping track of even minor, but repeated, damage 
is important. 
 
Formal cost-benefits have other flaws in that they do not take 
into account the social and personal costs of damage, as well as 
possible secondary costs. A culvert that washes out may be 
looked at as a minor cost, but if that washout isolated a senior 
or created an impediment to emergency response those costs 
are not quantified. A flood that damages a house is counted in 
terms of cost, but the loss of a feeling of safety or family photos 
is not counted. For these reasons, it is important to track hard 
costs, but to also factor in community values when looking at 
mitigation actions. 
 
Terrorism/Civil Hazards 
Terrorism is not simply some threatened or actual attack; it is 
one that is meant to use violence for political purposes or 
social change. Civil hazards are less intentional and include 
riots and other unrest that may not be organized and generally 
just include criminal mischief.  
 
Economic disruption/Shortages 
Natural hazards can create conditions that lead do this hazard, 
such as a massive blizzard that makes it hard to bring in food 
and fuel, but this hazard can also have human causes from 
simply a stock market crash or a failure in a supply chain.  The 
most pressing issue of this hazard would be loss of local 
income or critical supplies. So, either people do not have 
money for food and other necessities, or the necessities are just 
not available. The main area that this would be of concern is 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
54 
 
 
 
lack of food. As we have seen with the recent pandemic, the 
virus is not causing a food shortage directly, but rather massive 
unemployment has created lack of access to food as incomes 
are slashed, as well as to staffing food production facilities. The 
same result can happen from other causes, and so local 
systems that both grow and process food are good ways to 
weather such disruptions. This cannot simply be done in one 
town, but Hartford and other nearby towns do have working 
farms and small food companies. Hartford also has good 
organizational partners to identify those in need and distribute 
food. 
 
School Emergencies 
Schools are highly valued places as they are major community 
investments, have large social value, and where our children 
are. Schools can be impacted by a variety of emergencies that 
range from minor common ones, such as chemical accidents, 
fights, or weather events to larger ones such as structural 
failure or school shootings. Though the public has a high 
concern about serious school incidents, they are generally rare. 
However, due to their potential impact, their lack of likelihood 
is offset some. 
 VI. MITIGATION PROGRAM 
 
Mitigation can be at the town level or the individual level. In 
the resident survey, respondents let the planning team know 
what mitigation actions they have undertaken at their homes, 
and also reason why they have not taken mitigation actions.  
 
• 
Some of the top actions that residents have undertaken 
include purchasing homeowners/renter’s insurance, 
removing dead/dying trees or vegetation, and 
installing alternative power, heat, and/or water 
supplies.  
• 
The top reason that mitigation actions were not 
undertaken was cost (55%).  
GOALS AND POLICIES   
The 2008 Hartford Annex to the Two-River Ottauquechee 
Regional Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Plan was a simple eight-
page plan that referenced several regional goals:   
 
 
Reduce the loss of life and injury resulting from all 
hazards. 
 
Lessen financial losses and property damage incurred by 
municipalities, businesses and private citizens due to 
disasters. 
 
The impacts of hazards should be first avoided, then 
reduced where they cannot be reasonably avoided.  For 
flooding and riverine erosion, this can best be achieved by 
precluding development from hazard areas, and where 
development exists through property buyouts or flood 
protection sympathetic to the natural and human 
resources of the area. 
 
The connections between land use, development siting, 
drainage systems, building standards, and road design 
and maintenance and the effects of disasters on the Region 
should be recognized and incorporated into policy so that 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
55 
 
 
 
there is no adverse impact (increased hazard) from 
development. 
 
Mitigation actions should be part of larger, systematic 
efforts at disaster reduction based on the highest threats.  
Flooding should be addressed on a watershed scale.  
Structural fire and technological hazards should be 
lessened through statewide safety education and code 
compliance.  
 
Table 6.1 describes the implementation status of the 2008 plan 
and the 2014 plan.  Current hazard mitigation priorities for 
Hartford remain very similar, although details on needs and 
priorities were sharpened by the severe erosive flooding 
impacts experienced during Tropical Storm Irene and the 
community planning process that led to the 2014 Hazard 
Mitigation 
Plan. 
 
The 
list 
of 
current 
recommended 
implementation strategies under “Flooding and Erosion” in 
Table 6.2 for this plan grew substantially due to that learning 
process.  Landslides, included as a priority in 2008, were 
removed from the top priority list in the 2014 plan due to work 
having been completed to address the earlier concern. 
 
Over the last several years, the TRORC regional plan also has 
been updated to include language to support local mitigation.  
Through a post-Irene filter, it’s provides a framework for a 
strong regional effort to reduce impacts from future disaster 
events, primarily through sound land use and proper 
transportation infrastructure.   
 
The 2019 Hartford Master Plan (comprehensive plan) also 
contains a number of statements, objectives and strategies that 
support local hazard mitigation planning and implementation, 
including: 
 
Avoiding development of steep slopes 
 Continuing shoreline protection regulations in order to 
protect riparian areas. 
 Better protecting town wetlands.  
 Designing drainage systems and regulating development 
to lessen runoff into road drainage and existing town 
surface waters.  
 
 
Finally, the state of Vermont recently added additional state 
planning goals (under 24 V.S.A. § 4302) to encourage planning 
for flood resilience:  
 
 
New development in identified flood hazard, fluvial 
erosion, and river corridor protection areas should be 
avoided. If new development is to be built in such areas, it 
should not exacerbate flooding and fluvial erosion.  
 
The protection and restoration of floodplains and upland 
forested areas that attenuate and moderate flooding and 
fluvial erosion should be encouraged.  
 
Flood emergency preparedness and response planning 
should be encouraged.  
 
Amendments to state planning statutes since the previous HMP 
was adopted require the inclusion of a new flood resiliency 
HARTFORD HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN     2020-2025 DRAFT 
 
 
56 
 
 
 
element in updated town plans after July 2014.  This 
requirement may be met by FEMA-approved hazard mitigation 
plans that meet these requirements, which may be incorporated 
by reference in the town plan. 
 
It should also be noted that a decade of public outreach and 
education was necessary for the town to enact a thirty-foot 
setback and buffer requirement on streams and ponds, and a 
100-foot setback and buffer along riverbanks, in its land use 
regulations, as applied to new development. The Irene 
experience raised much broader public awareness by clearly 
demonstrating the stormwater storage role of floodplains – 
including town recreational lands – and the need for vegetated 
buffers.  Treed riparian areas in town parks that were damaged 
in Irene have since been re-planted and will be maintained. 
EXISTING PROGRAMS  
The 
Town 
of 
Hartford 
participates in the National 
Flood 
Insurance 
Program.  
Flood Insurance Rate Maps 
were first developed on July 2, 
1979 and updated February 
17, 
1989 
and 
again 
on 
September 28, 2007.  The Town first adopted flood hazard 
area regulations on June 8, 1979.  The bylaw was updated on 
September 18, 2007.  In 2006, Hartford adopted a zoning 
bylaw amendment, “Protection of Surface Waters.”  The zoning 
bylaw established measures to protect riparian areas and 
instituted a setback for excavations and the placement of 
structures within 100’ of rivers and within 30’ of other surface 
waters.   
 
The Town of Hartford also has Zoning Regulations, 
Subdivision Regulations, a Transportation Ordinance, an 
Emergency Management Ordinance, a Hazardous Materials 
Ordinance and Department of Public Works Specifications.  
The Hartford Fire Department’s Fire Prevention Division, 
under contract with Vermont Division of Fire Safety, issues 
construction permits for most public buildings under state- 
adopted fire codes.  
 
Following the Irene Flood, Hartford participated in the Hazard 
Mitigation Grant Program to buyout properties badly 
damaged by Tropical Storm Irene.  A total of eight properties 
were acquired. And one through another funding source.  
Hartford also received hazard mitigation funds to elevate 
wastewater pump stations out of the 100-year flood zone.  
This work was completed in 2013.   
 
The Town of Hartford Department of Planning and 
Development Services has been responsible for coordinating 
the update of the Town’s Hazard Mitigation Plan.  The impact 
of Irene and the resulting town actions resulted in a much 
more comprehensive mitigation plan and recommended 
strategies and actions in the 2014 which continue to be 
relevant today.

PLAN MITIGATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES  
A compendium of possible mitigation measures was provided 
for feedback during public meetings in the 2014 HMP.  During 
these meetings, the Planning and Development Department 
staff developed a scoring system that related potential hazards 
to be addressed, and the town’s administrative, technical and 
fiscal resources.  
 
Priority 1 – Actionable items to be initiated or maintained 
during the next five years that have a large area-wide 
benefit for little cost, address urgent post-Irene need for 
individuals or key community infrastructure, and/or 
anticipate availability of funding and resources.  
Priority 2 – Items needing further analysis during the next 
five years to determine the best course of action based on 
cost versus probable benefit.  Action may begin based on 
analyses. 
Priority 3 – Items important to the town for consideration 
in the future, but will not be acted on in the next five years. 
 
Using this approach, Planning and Development Department 
staff and Resilient Hartford members identified the top 
implementation strategies and actions to be taken within the 
next five years (see Appendix E). The Selectboard then reviewed 
the priorities, taking into consideration the costs and benefits of 
various strategies, and technical feasibilities. They settled on 
what the Town could commit to over the next five years, given 
current and anticipated department workloads and budget. 
 
The resulting breakout of mitigation tasks by category for the 
Town’s 2020-2025 implementation program – including those 
items in Priority 3 which are not likely to be addressed in the 
next five years, but should remain on the list to continue active 
consideration. These are displayed in Table 6.2.  
 
Table 
6.2 
allocates 
responsibilities, 
program 
funding 
resources/costs and time period by Mitigation Action.  The 
majority of the Mitigation Actions are further broken out into 
major steps (a., b., c.), with benchmark dates by when each step 
will be completed.  The few Action items without steps were 
determined to be one major task. The “When (Timeline)” 
column provides the calendar year by which the task will be 
completed, and takes into consideration the workflow demands 
of the Mitigation Plan and other Town responsibilities unrelated 
to the Mitigation Plan.  
 
The “Funding Resources” column addresses the funding source 
and estimated cost of implementing (which was part of the 
town’s analysis in prioritizing tasks for the next five years), 
represented by Low (under $5000), Medium ($5,000 - $10,000) 
and High (over $10,000).  The Hartford Department of Planning 
and Development Services will have primary responsibility for 
overseeing, monitoring and providing updates on the Town’s 
HMP/mitigation program, and will involve other Town 
Departments and outside organizations as noted in the Table.

Resolution Urging Fair and Direct Federal Emergency Aid to Municiplaities Reopen 
and Rebuild American Economices 
Whereas, America’s cities, towns and villages face unprecedented threats due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 
emergency; and 
Whereas, municipalities are essential to America’s economic recovery and without funding support for local 
governments, municipalities may go from being a critical part of the economic solution, to becoming a major 
obstacle to long-term stabilization and recovery; and 
Whereas, America’s cities, towns and villages will experience budgetary shortfalls of up $134 billion in fiscal year 
2020 alone, and the negative effects of the pandemic emergency on communities will continue long after this 
year; and 
Whereas, three million critical municipal worker jobs are at risk, threatening cuts to basic community services, 
including 9-1-1 response, sanitation, economy recovery and maintenance; and 
Whereas, communities have taken extraordinary measures to protect health, safety, and the continuation of essential 
services throughout the emergency; and 
Whereas, Vermont’s municipal leaders are united in helping their communities make a strong comeback after 
experiencing furloughs among municipal staff, loss of direct municipal revenue and tremendous demand from 
residents and Main Street and other local businesses for assistance; and  
Whereas, America’s rural communities and small towns, especially here in Vermont, are struggling just as much 
as big cities and risk being left far behind; 
Now, therefore, be it resolved, that: 
1.
Vermont local officials call on Congress to allocate fair and direct federal support to all of America’s
communities, regardless of population size;
2.
this funding be flexible and address not only the additional expenses incurred by communities to respond to the
pandemic emergency, but also the dramatic budgetary shortfalls resulting from pauses in commerce, tourism,
and other economic engines;
3.
local governments will ensure federal funds are immediately used to rebuild and reopen the economy;
4.
funding will keep workers employed and critical services operating; and
5.
Vermont local officials have been part of the emergency response and now call on Congress to build a united
national partnership for a safe, healthy, prosperous life.
Submitted by the Town of Hartford, Vermont.
