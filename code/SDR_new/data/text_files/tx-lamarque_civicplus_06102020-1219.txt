Joe Compian, Chairperson 
 
Keep La Marque Beautiful Commission 
As residents of La Marque we are a community, we stick together and 
we work together to do good things for our city and our residents. I 
want to tell you about a call that came in.  
I was asked to help a soon to be mother who is unable to work due to a 
complicated pregnancy. Her husband lost his job due to the Covid 19 
Shutdowns. They had to move back in with her parents and they had 
nothing at all for a new baby. The Grandmother is very fragile due to 
Lupus and was despondent that she couldn’t afford to help or even try 
to give a baby shower due to Covid 19. With the donations of many of 
our residents and others in the community. I was able to collect just 
about everything they could possibly need.  
One donor said “It takes a village , to raise a child”. The child will be 
named Genevieve Rose and I am so proud of all of you for giving her a 
good start. Many thanks to these wonderful people. You are the Village. 
Thank you, 
Katherine Herrin

Hi, 
I hope you are staying safe and healthy as we work through this unprecedented time. We are set to announce the winners of
the 2020 Governor's Community Achievement Awards next week, and before we make that announcement, I wanted to let
you know that your community won 2nd place for your category for GCAA. We ask that you keep this information
confidential until we make the larger announcement next week, after which you are welcome to share with leadership or
others who might be interested. 
In the meantime, we invite you to save the date for the GCAA Awards Dinner, which will take place on Tuesday, September
29th as part of the KTB Annual Conference in Houston. 
Be on the lookout for the official GCAA announcement from KTB next week, as well as more information on the GCAA dinner
at conference later this year. 
Let me know if you have any questions, and congratulations!

Waste
Management’s
At
Your

program
makes the responsible disposal of household
hazardous waste, electronic, and other special
materials safe, simple, and convenient for all La
Marque residents. The addition of the At Your

program
not
only
provides
La

residents with a vital service, but also improves
sustainability and diversion. This program helps
reduce
illegal
dumping,
as
well
as
eases
groundwater
and
soil
contamination,
and
increases neighborhood aesthetics. In addition, a
majority
of
the
material
collected
can
be
recycled.

Subject: 2020 Affiliate Recognition
To: Sara Nichols <sara@ktb.org>
Good Afternoon,
We greatly value 
our partnership with your community and look forward to working with your affiliate organization in 2020. 
Affiliate Recognition is the time of year for affiliates to report activities and events that their affiliate took part 
in that previous calendar year 
(so for 2020 affiliate recognition, you are reporting on activities that took place in 2019). Affiliates that 
participate in Recognition can achieve Good Standing, Silver Star, or Gold Star status with KTB for 2020. For 
affiliates on probation, this is your 
opportunity to get out of probation and get back into Good Standing with KTB to qualify for the full benefits of 
being a KTB affiliate. 
You 
are receiving this reminder, because your affiliate has NOT completed the Annual Report or paid 
Annual Dues. Please let me know if you believe you received this message in error. 
As a reminder, 
affiliates who have completed their annual recognition requirements to meet Good Standing or higher are the 
only communities eligible for KTB grants, Don't mess with Texas collateral for litter prevention events, bonus 
incentive items for Great American Cleanup/Don't 
mess with Texas Trash-Off, and to apply for a scholarship to the KTB annual conference. KTB recognition is 
also an important requirement for Keep America Beautiful certification, and only KTB affiliates in Good 
Standing can use KTB branded materials. 
To 
submit for 2020 Affiliate Recognition:
1. 
Submit your KTB Annual Report. Click on this 
link to review and complete this Annual Report. 
2. 
To pay Annual Dues, you can login to your affiliate 
portal and pay via credit. You can also call Tina Litzner to pay over the phone at 512-961-5257. If you 
are planning to pay by check to the address listed in my signature. 
3. 
On the affiliate portal, located on the KTB 
website, there is a pre-recorded webinar about 2020 Recognition. Please watch it to learn all about the 
process and get your questions answered!

2/2
4. 
The KTB Annual Report and Affiliate Dues must 
be completed by 5:00 p.m. CST on Friday, March 27, 2020 
to be considered in Good Standing or above for 2020 with KTB. 
All affiliates who complete recognition will be notified of their status no later than April 
9, 2020. Gold and Silver Star affiliates will also be formally recognized during the Annual Meeting and 
Affiliate Recognition Breakfast at the Keep Texas Beautiful conference in Houston, Texas.   
Please review 
the Affiliate Recognition requirements carefully and let me know if you have any questions. Thank you for all 
you do to keep Texas beautiful!

CLEANUP UPDATE FROM KTB
Keep America Beautiful has announced that the Great American Cleanup (GAC) will resume, starting June 1
and run through October 18. Keep Texas Beautiful participates annually in this national program but we wanted
to clarify how Texans can get involved.
KTB looks forward to resuming group cleanups when it is safe for large gatherings. At this time, we are
promoting individual cleanups or joining members of your household only. Please follow all local, county, and
state guidance. KTB reminds Texans to stay safe when choosing to go outside and clean up your communities.
When picking up litter, KTB recommends participants to do so responsibly and at their comfort level. Your
cleanup group should include only members of your household. Please wear a face mask and disposable
gloves, and use a litter grabber. Maintain at least 6 feet of distance from passersby. 
When you are finished collecting litter, please make sure your trash bag is securely tied to protect sanitation
workers. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water and hand sanitizer after collecting litter. Please
dispose of your single-use face masks and disposable gloves properly and in the waste bin. 
Until we can safely resume large gatherings, KTB will not provide cleanup supplies. We look forward to
shipping cleanup supplies again when we can join neighbors and friends out in our communities!
PRINTABLE RESOURCES
To help you communicate cleanup guidance to your affiliate volunteers and community members, we have
created these printable resources that include our cleanup guidance and how to safely remove disposable
gloves.
Individual Cleanup Guidance
Recommendations for individuals and
households to participate in cleanups.
PPE Litter Cleanup Guidance
How to properly pick up littered personal
protective equipment (PPE).
