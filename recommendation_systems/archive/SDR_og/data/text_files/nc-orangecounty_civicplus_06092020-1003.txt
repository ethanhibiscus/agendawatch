PURPOSE:  FY2020-25 Capital Investment Plan - Accept the Five Year Capital Investment Plan 
and Approve the Intent to Adopt Capital Funding for FY2020-21.   
 
BACKGROUND:  For over 20 years, the County has produced a Capital Investment Plan (CIP) 
that establishes a budget planning guide related to capital needs for the County as well as 
Schools.  The current CIP consists of a 5-year plan that is evaluated annually to include year-to-
year changes in priorities, needs, and available resources.  Approval of the CIP commits the 
County to the first year funding only of the capital projects; all other years are used as a planning 
tool and serves as a financial plan. 
 
Capital Investment Plan – Overview 
The FY 2020-25 CIP includes County Projects, School Projects, and Proprietary Projects.  The 
School Projects include Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools, Orange County Schools, and Durham 
Technical Community College – Orange County Campus projects.  The Proprietary Projects 
include Water and Sewer, Solid Waste Enterprise Fund, and Sportsplex projects.       
 
The CIP has been prepared anticipating moderate economic growth of approximately 2% in 
property tax growth over the next five years, and 4% sales tax growth in Years 2-5.  Sales Tax   
proceeds for Year 1 (FY 2020-21) are estimated to decline by 4.5% due to the current coronavirus 
pandemic.  Many of the projects in the CIP will rely on debt financing to fund the projects. 
 
The items below include revisions made to the following Capital Projects since the presentation 
of the Manager’s Recommended Capital Investment Plan on April 2, 2019: 
 
 At the May 14, 2020 Budget Work Session, staff included a revised Schools Capital 
Projects Summary reflecting adjustments made in regards to changes to the FY 2020-21 
budgeted ADM percentages, based on changes made from the time of the original CIP 
presentation and the FY 2020-21 Manager’s Recommended Operating Budget 
presentation.  The impact of these numbers changed the CHCCS % from 60.14% to 
59.99%, and changed the OCS % from 39.86% to 40.01%.

FINANCIAL IMPACT:  The Five Year Capital Investment Plan is a long-range financial planning 
tool with a financial impact in FY2020-21, if the first year of the CIP is approved by the Board of 
County Commissioners with the adoption of the Annual Operating Budget. 
 
SOCIAL JUSTICE IMPACT:  There are no Social Justice Goal impacts associated with this 
item.   
 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:  There are no Orange County Environmental Responsibility Goal 
impacts associated with this agenda item. 
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  The Manager recommends that the Board accept the Five Year  
Capital Investment Plan and Approve the Intent to Adopt Capital Funding for FY2020-21.
