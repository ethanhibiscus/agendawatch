Public Comment  
Village residents wishing to respectfully share thoughts about any matter concerning the Village may do so by 
submitting an email to publiccomment@deerfield.il.us prior to the meeting. Emails received will be read aloud 
during Public Comment. Any e-mails received during the meeting will be read during the second public 
comment before the end of the meeting. We ask that you keep your emailed response to under 200 words to 
allow time for others to be heard and for the Board to progress through the public meeting agenda. The Board 
typically does not immediately respond to public comments or engage in open dialogue, but we are of course 
actively listening to your comments.
