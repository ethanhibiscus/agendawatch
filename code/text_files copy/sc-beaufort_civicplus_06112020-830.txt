5 DISCUSSION – MINIMAL CHECKLIST 
Mr. Bullard mentioned that at the Board’s last meeting, we requested to have a minimum checklist 
be put in place so the Board would have something to go by because not having that checklist makes 
it difficult.  Mr. Bullard said were a little heavy on conceptual requirements and when at final, no 
idea of stormwater is difficult.  At preliminary, applicant should then submit for stormwater. 
Board talked about native plants.  Mr. Prichard said we need to look at our list in the Code and revise 
it.  Mr.  McFann asked isn’t there a Tree Board.  Mr. Prichard said yes, and they review public spaces 
and DRB reviews private spaces.  Ms. McFann said it would be nice to coordinate with the Boards as 
far as “native” plants.  Mr. Prichard spoke about landscape bonds and the process for them.  Ms. 
McFann said our ecosystems are impacted. 
 
Board talked about who controls the traffic lights and whether or not a traffic light would cure the 
issue at the new Wendy’s.   
6 ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. Morillo made a motion, to adjourn the meeting; seconded by Mr. Cox. The motion passed 
unanimously.  The meeting ended at 3:05 p.m.

3 STAFF COMMENTS 
1. The applicant shall not receive final approval for this project until all required project documentation 
noted in the City of Beaufort Design Review Checklists has been submitted. This includes but is not 
limited to details, wall sections, material samples, lighting information, and a final list of materials.  
2. Per Section 4.6.1.G of the Beaufort Code, buildings and additional site elements shall not be painted 
in a color or pattern that expresses corporate identity, to the extent that the paint color or pattern is 
not consistent with the design standards of the district. Per Section 4.6.4.G.3 of the Beaufort Code, 
recommended colors are traditional historic colors, earth tones (greens, tans, light browns, terra 
cotta, grays, pale primary and secondary colors, and white and cream tones...”  The applicant should 
use a neutral color palate. It is appropriate for the bays in the building to be a different color than the 
protruding pilasters. The split face concrete block should all be one color. The applicant should 
revise and submit color choices for review.  
3. The site plan is showing discrepancies regarding placement of the BJWSA easement and buffer line 
along Robert Smalls Parkway, and the building still appears to be overlapping the easement line. 
Applicant should resubmit site plan with clear dimensions and notations regarding easement and 
buffer. Applicant should also review and show compliance with buffer requirements outlined in 
section 5.5.1 of The Beaufort Code.  
4. The applicant needs to show that glazing conforms with requirements noted in Section 4.6.3.C.1 and 
Section 4.6.4.C.1 of the Beaufort Code.  
5. The 3D views in the application do not match the elevations, as the cornice and metal coping details 
are different. The applicant should clarify which details are correct and ensure compliance with 
Section 4.6.3.D.A of the Beaufort Code.  
6. The rear elevation is a blank façade and is still visible from the street. The applicant should ensure 
compliance with Section 4.6.4.D.2 of the Beaufort Code, which states that “facades that are visible 
from streets… shall not include expanses of blank walls of 20 linear feet or greater.” 
Staff recommendation: Staff recommends that final review of this project be deferred until all 
documentation requirements noted in the City of Beaufort Design Review Checklists have been met and the 
conditions above have been addressed.
