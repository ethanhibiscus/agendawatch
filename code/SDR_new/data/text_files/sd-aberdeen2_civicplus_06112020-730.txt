RESOLUTION EXTENDING ORDINANCE NO. 20-04-05 
COVID-19 EMERGENCY ORDINANCE NO. 3 
 AND EASING CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS OF THE ORDINANCE 
 
 
 
WHEREAS, the Aberdeen City Council adopted COVID-19 Emergency 
Ordinance No. 3 (Ordinance No. 20-04-05) (“emergency ordinance”) implementing 
certain measures which it deemed necessary to slow the community spread of the virus 
responsible for the COVID-19 disease; and 
 
 
WHEREAS, aided by the voluntary compliance of most residents and businesses 
with the social distancing and hygiene practices recommended by the CDC, such 
measures have helped in slowing the community spread of the virus and providing a basis 
to begin reopening businesses and other public gathering places within the community; 
and 
 
 
WHEREAS, the emergency ordinance shall be repealed, in part or in whole, on 
the day following each regular or special meeting of the City Council, unless the City 
Council at such regular or special meeting by resolution affirms (1) the continued 
existence of the public health emergency, and (2) the necessity of all or certain parts of 
the social distancing measures set forth in Section A, Paragraphs 1 - 7, and extends all or 
any part of the ordinance for the day following the next regular or special meeting of the 
City Council.  
 
WHEREAS, based on the number of cases in Brown County, the almost complete 
lack of hospitalization in the City, and the available modeling, the City Council believes 
some of the social distancing restrictions can be modified to allow businesses to resume 
on-site services of customers without causing the number of cases in the city to rise to the 
level that it will overwhelm the hospitals’ capacity if proper procedures are put in place.  
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED: 
 
 
1. 
The City Council affirms that some, but not all, of the social distancing 
measures set forth in Section A, Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the emergency 
ordinance are necessary for the prevention and spread within the City of Aberdeen of the 
contagious virus. 
 
 
2. 
The City Council hereby extends paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of Section 
A of the emergency ordinance for the day following the next regular or special meeting 
of the City Council, except that part of each paragraph that prohibits or closes on-site

facilities must be cleaned and disinfected between each use. 
 
 
3.  
In addition to the specific requirements listed above, businesses shall
