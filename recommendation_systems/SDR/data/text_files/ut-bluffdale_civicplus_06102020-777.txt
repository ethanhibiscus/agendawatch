Bluffdale Supermarket Analysis Report, Doug Munson, MTN Real Estate Advisors.

2 
City Planner/Economic Development Director, Grant Crowell highlighted the results of a 
3 
supermarket location analysis prepared by MTN Retail Advisors.   
4 
 
5 
Doug Munson from MTN Retail Advisors presented the results of the Supermarket Location 
6 
Analysis and thanked the City Council for the opportunity.  He introduced Stan Coos from MTN 
7 
Retail Advisors who performed the analysis.   
8 
 
9 
Mr. Munson provided information on the company and its process for attracting grocers.  MTN 
10 
Retail Advisors is based out of Salt Lake City and has been in business since 2004.  The company 
11 
provides services and analytics that parallel what the grocery industry does internally as they 
12 
validate future opportunities and put a strong focus on accurately forecasting sales potential.   
13 
 
14 
MTN Retail Advisors has strong relationships with grocers such as Associated Foods who manages 
15 
Lee’s Marketplace and other retailers, Harmon’s, and Sprouts.  Mr. Munson explained that Sprouts 
16 
is a publicly-traded grocer based in Phoenix, Arizona with over 300 stores.  He noted that the 
17 
grocer is considering expanding to Utah.   
18 
 
19 
During the pandemic, most grocers experienced an increase of 15% to 40% in revenue; however, 
20 
they also experienced stress on income, increased supply chain costs, and increased labor costs.  
21 
Mr. Munson noted that Smith’s, the grocer that was interested in building a store in Bluffdale a 
22 
few years ago, is putting most of their capital toward eCommerce.  He added that Kroger will likely 
23 
invest in more brick and mortar stores.   
24 
  
25 
Mr. Munson outlined the services that MTN Retail Advisors provides as well as considerations the 
26 
grocers use to analyze opportunities.

3 
• Market Analysis:  Determining how to compete in the market (i.e., residents currently have 
1 
to leave Bluffdale to shop for groceries). 
2 
• Competitive Analysis:  Understanding competitors influencing the Bluffdale market. 
3 
• Site Location Analysis:  Using the sales forecasting model that grocery stores use and 
4 
testing various locations. 
5 
• Real Estate Strategic Planning:  Working with the City to understand residential growth, 
6 
future road network improvements, and shopping patterns. 
7 
• Company Relationships: Relationships with grocers, networking at conferences, and 
8 
providing grocers with sales volume potential in various locations. 
9 
• Organizational vision, strategy, and tactics.  
10 
 
11 
Demographics: Bluffdale vs. Salt Lake City 
12 
 
13 
• Population data for daytime customers. 
14 
• 2019 Race and Ethnicity comparisons. 
15 
• 2019 Employment and Education comparisons. 
16 
• Household Growth over a 9- year time frame.  Both Bluffdale and Salt Lake County are 
17 
showing healthy growth. Bluffdale shows solid growth over the next five years.  
18 
• Median Household Income:  Large discrepancy between Salt Lake City and Bluffdale.  
19 
• Education:  Salt Lake City residents score slightly higher than Bluffdale residents.  
20 
Mr. Munson pointed out that customers of Sprouts are typically college graduates. 
21 
 
22 
Sample Analysis:  Lee’s Marketplace as a Simple Site 
23 
 
24 
• Executive Summary: Includes overarching assumptions and transportation network 
25 
changes.  Mr. Munson noted that the area near the prison site is difficult to predict.  He 
26 
added that it was unnecessary to make assumptions but he will provide the grocery potential 
27 
for the area.   
28 
• The sample Mr. Munson provided was based on a 35,000 square foot store located at 
29 
Redwood Road and Bangerter Highway.  Mr. Munson stated that the size of the store could

4 
increase or decrease depending on the grocer’s preference but noted the location is the best 
1 
site for a grocery store. 
2 
• The store was expected to average $330,000 a week in the first year.  The second and third-
3 
year sales numbers will increase based on population growth, inflation, and a two-year 
4 
maturation period.  The analysis provides the sales figures in an annualized dollar per 
5 
square foot format. 
6 
 
7 
Dave Kallas asked for an example of a store that is 35,000 square feet and what the average 
8 
grocery store size is.  Mr. Munson noted that the original Peterson’s store in Riverton was 
9 
close to 35,000 square feet.  In contrast, Harmon’s in Draper is 70,000 square feet and the 
10 
Walmart in Herriman is approximately 40,000 square feet.  He noted that Grocers are 
11 
reducing store sizes due to e-commerce and stocking fewer products that can be ordered 
12 
online. 
13 
 
14 
• Site evaluation: Lays out street conditions, access, visibility, population density, ingress, 
15 
and egress, etc.   
16 
• Competitive assumption:  The example notes that WinCo plans to open an 82,500 square-
17 
foot store in Herriman and that is factored into the analysis that each of the grocers will 
18 
receive. 
19 
• Grocery premise: “If you build a store, people want to eat more.”  This premise also 
20 
includes pulling volume from other stores.  Grocers consider that they will need to pull 
21 
volume from existing grocery stores to succeed.   
22 
• The analysis includes information on competitors including location, city, distance, sales 
23 
area, total square footage, and sales as of March 2020.  Population growth and inflation are 
24 
included to advance the predictive model to February 2022 to show how the stores will be 
25 
trending.  It also shows how much volume Lee’s Marketplace will pull and how it will 
26 
impact competitors.  WinCo was also factored in.  In the example, Lee’s grocery would 
27 
draw $29,000 per week away from WinCo reducing WinCo’s sales to approximately 
28 
$930,000 which equates to a 3% impact.

5 
• Store trends in Bluffdale:  Walmart always does very well, Harmon’s is number one with 
1 
75% of customers coming from the Bluffdale trade area and the grocery trade area.  The 
2 
model provides an index of 100 where stores performing over 100 are very dominant and 
3 
strong and those below 100 are not performing as well as the competition.  
4 
• A market share map was provided showing the primary trade area around Bangerter 
5 
Highway and Redwood Road. A store located at this site would pull volume into Riverton. 
6 
• Grocers view boundaries by block group.  Lee’s Marketplace will fall into Block Group 
7 
#9, which is closer to Herriman and Riverton.  The total grocery potential of the group is 
8 
$245,000 per week, and Lee’s Marketplace would pull in 5% of that total.  The analysis 
9 
does account for any volume past the Walmart Neighborhood Market or Peterson’s or 
10 
anywhere on the east side due to the I-15 barrier. 
11 
• Mr. Munson provided a map of volume and competitors and noted that Lee’s Marketplace 
12 
would take $39,000 per week or 4.8% of volume from Harmon’s grocery store. 
13 
 
14 
Mr. Reid asked if the location will draw motorists traveling up Redwood Road that are not 
15 
residents of the area.  Mr. Munson replied that 90% of volume comes from within the trade 
16 
area boundary and 10% comes from outside of the boundary. 
17 
 
18 
Mr. Reid asked how Sam’s Club and Costco are factored in.  Mr. Munson noted that neither 
19 
is located in the immediate trade area.  Volume will likely not be pulled from these types 
20 
of stores due to the different shopping experience.  If Costco was closer, it would have been 
21 
included but grocers view them differently and do not expect to pull volume from them. 
22 
 
23 
• Grocery landscape: Considers the format of stores including supercenters, discount stores, 
24 
conventional stores (i.e. Smith’s) and helps determine the type of store that would be 
25 
compatible with the type of demographic in the area.  Lee’s Marketplace is a conventional 
26 
store whereas Harmon’s is a higher-end, quality service store.  This information would be 
27 
provided to show the conventional customer demographic in the area.  In contrast, quality 
28 
service and natural organic customer demographics would be provided to Sprouts.

Potential Stores:  
2 
 
3 
• Macey’s:  Mr. Munson provided the sales volume for a 35 square-foot fresh market store.  
4 
The store may ask to increase the size to 50,000 square feet but 35 square feet is a good 
5 
prototype that produces $321,000 per week.  No sister stores impact this conventional store. 
6 
• Harmon’s:  This store is slightly more problematic.  The forecast was run higher using a 
7 
64,000 square-foot store with larger sales.  The volume is just under $600,000 per week; 
8 
however, it will take $135,000 per week from sister stores.  Mr. Munson stated that some 
9 
stores will aggressively take down a store to protect their market share but Harmon’s could 
10 
also request a forecast on a smaller store to reduce the impact on sister stores. 
11 
• Sprouts:  A light forecast was run on this store at 25,000 square feet.  Sprouts is a natural 
12 
organic store and is not conventional.  This type of store would not drive traditional sales 
13 
but would be used as a secondary store for produce and organic products.  Mr. Munson 
14 
stated that Bluffdale needs a full-service conventional grocer. He recommended selecting 
15 
a conventional grocer and considering Sprouts as a secondary store in three to four years.   
16 
• Lee’s Marketplace will be the most viable store.  There are no sister store impacts, and they 
17 
have been very aggressive in their growth.  The grocer recently opened a store in Salt Lake 
18 
City and outsources a lot of their work to MTN Retail Advisors.   
19 
 
20 
Mr. Munson disclosed that his company is currently analyzing a Harmon’s store location 
21 
in the Saratoga Springs area.  He noted that Smith’s is performing very well there and a 
22 
Costco is coming in; however, he does not believe any deals are in place at this time.  Mr. 
23 
Munson believes the grocer would consider Bluffdale a distinctly different opportunity.  
24 
 
25 
• Macey’s would be the company’s second choice since they are almost on par with Lee’s 
26 
Marketplace.  Their fresh concept would be viable, and they are a conventional store with 
27 
a nice produce differentiation.   
28 
• The company does not believe Harmon’s would be a good choice due to the impact on 
29 
sister stores.

• Sprouts should not be considered at this time but would be a good alternative store to 
1 
consider in the future. 
2 
 
3 
Mr. Munson stated that the next steps will involve meeting with Mr. Crowell to assess the findings 
4 
and provide the reports to the prospective tenants.  The reports will be provided to Jonathan Badger, 
5 
the CEO of Lee’s Marketplace, Steve Minor, Vice President of Real Estate for Associated Foods 
6 
for Macey’s, and Dean Peterson, the CEO of Harmon’s grocery store.  Mr. Munson can also contact 
7 
the broker for Sprouts if the City Council would like to pursue that option. 
8 
 
9 
Mayor Timothy stated that he would be concerned about selling the site to Sprouts since it would 
10 
make a conventional store go further down the road.  Mr. Munson agreed and recommended not 
11 
including them at this time.  Mayor Timothy asked if WinCo would be a viable option.  
12 
Mr. Munson noted that they could run a report on it.  He added that WinCo wants a lot of separation 
13 
because they are a large store and the location would be too close to their other stores. 
14 
 
15 
Mr. Reid asked if the City should offer any incentives to entice grocers to the area.  Mr. Munson 
16 
recommended allowing the volume to stand on its own merit and only provide incentives if issues 
17 
arise during negotiations.  Mr. Reid asked if any other grocers will be locating in Herriman or 
18 
Baker other than WinCo.  Mr. Munson stated that there are no other stores that he was aware of.   
19 
 
20 
Mr. Reid asked if a location closer to the freeway would be good for Sprouts.  Mr. Munson stated 
21 
that Sprouts would prefer something more regional outside of the neighborhood and suggested a 
22 
location with direct access off the I-15.   
23 
 
24 
Mayor Timothy stated that the location off of I-15 near the prison site would be a good location 
25 
for Costco.  He understands they are unhappy with the congestion at their current location and have 
26 
considered shutting it down.  Mr. Munson was not surprised that they are disappointed but noted 
27 
that it would have to be exceptionally bad for them to move.  He added that Costco is unlikely to 
28 
engage in any serious conversation at this time but suggested proposing the idea to the broker, Tim 
29 
Simonson.

2020 Bluffdale Economic Development Strategic Plan, Council Member Kallas. 
4 
 
5 
Dave Kallas recommended that the Economic Development Committee develop a strategic plan 
6 
that identifies specific goals, strategies, and projects.  An Economic Development Strategic Plan 
7 
was adopted in 2014 and it is supposed to be updated every five years.  The current plan is visionary 
8 
and does not provide specific objectives or goals. 
9 
 
10 
A strategic plan template was provided by Council Member Kallas.  He pointed out how the 
11 
template would be used and noted that it contains an outline for the vision and priorities of the 
12 
committee.  It includes objectives, strategies, goals, and due dates along with ratings to indicate 
13 
whether goals were met, not met, or exceeded.   
14 
 
15 
Council Member Kallas suggested that the committee work on the plan together or designate a 
16 
subcommittee to work on a draft for review.  Upon finalization, the Strategic Plan would be sent 
17 
to the City Council for adoption.   
18 
 
19 
Mayor Timothy recommended forming a subcommittee consisting of two City Council and two 
20 
Planning Commission Members along with a few staff members.  Dave Kallas agreed and noted 
21 
that it would be good to have staff present since many of the items will impact the budget.   
22 
 
23 
Traci Crockett and Debbie Cragun commented that the Strategic Plan is a great idea and helps the 
24 
City move forward.  Debbie Cragun and Steve Walston volunteered to serve on the subcommittee 
25 
along with Dave Kallas and Traci Crockett.  Mayor Timothy asked Council Member Kallas to take 
26

2 
crematory machines, was also present.  Mr. Howland explained that Mr. Rodriguez is interested in 
1 
developing a funeral home and crematory in four of the six units within the Saddleback Pointe 
2 
Development on 2700 West.  The development is currently in a General Commercial zone and 
3 
allows for a mortuary but does not specify the allowance of a crematorium.  Mr. Howland stated 
4 
that an application had been submitted for a text amendment to change the definition of mortuary 
5 
to include crematoriums. 
6 
 
7 
Mr. Howland reported that the company is interested in moving one of their funeral homes from 
8 
Draper to Bluffdale.  The funeral home is currently located in Draper off I-15 and 12300 South.   
9 
 
10 
Mr. Rodriguez noted that Serenity Funeral Homes have been in business for 20 years in Utah, and 
11 
for 12 years in Draper.  The company runs a total of four funeral homes in Utah with locations in 
12 
St. George, Lindon, Draper, and Logan as well as three cremation centers in St. George, Lindon, 
13 
and Logan.  The company’s business strategy over the next few years is to relocate the Draper and 
14 
Lindon locations.   
15 
 
16 
Mr. Rodriguez reported that Mr. Howland has been great to work with and he was pleased with 
17 
the location, the area, and the potential for expansion.  The business works closely with other 
18 
funeral homes and the Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Bluffdale.  If the request is approved, the 
19 
funeral home and cremation center will be the first and only in Bluffdale.   
20 
 
21 
Wendy Aston asked what kind of emissions are produced by a crematorium.  Mr. Rodriguez replied 
22 
that the cremation centers are built to be safe for communities.  John Raggett, Vice President of 
23 
American Crematory Equipment, reported that Serenity Funeral Homes will be using equipment 
24 
from his company.  He explained that the emissions are lower than those of a fast food restaurant 
25 
due to the high temperatures used in the cremation process, which is generally 1,500 to 2,000 
26 
degrees.  The process emits particulates so minute that they are not hazardous.  Mr. Raggett noted 
27 
that crematories have been located in Southern California near schools, playgrounds, and homes 
28 
and would not have been placed in those locations if there were any emission issues.

Mr. Rodriguez explained that his company does a lot of work in the community and works with 
1 
hospice centers and the public to provide education on the burial and cremation processes.  He 
2 
added that the rate of cremation has increased in the State of Utah in the last few years, and 
3 
approximately 50% of the population is choosing cremation.   
4 
 
5 
Mayor Timothy asked if there is any noise associated with the process and what is added to the 
6 
building to make the process less noticeable.  Mr. Raggett stated that one smokestack will come 
7 
out of the building that will be covered with a façade.  Only heat fumes will be emitted unless an 
8 
upset cremation occurs where there is smoke.  Those events are rare and usually the result of 
9 
operator error.  They are not harmful and are rectified immediately.   
10 
 
11 
Mayor Timothy asked about the height of the smokestack.  Mr. Raggett explained that the 
12 
crematory is eight feet tall and the stack is 10 feet for a total height of 18 feet.  He recommended 
13 
that the stack come out of the building four to six feet for safety reasons.  The only person that can 
14 
hear the equipment is the person running it.  Mr. Howland mentioned that the smokestack will not 
15 
be visible since the building is only 26 feet tall.  
16 
 
17 
Mr. Rodriguez explained that each of the Serenity Funeral Homes facilities includes a cremation 
18 
center because it is important for the company to take care of the process from beginning to end to 
19 
ensure accuracy, dignity, and respect for families.   
20 
 
21 
Wendy Aston asked if any particulate matter comes out of the smokestack.  Mr. Raggett replied 
22 
that the maximum allowed is 60 PPM (Parts Per Million) and the crematory emits less than that.  
23 
The equipment is made of low Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) burners and is designed to be smokeless and 
24 
odorless.  The particulate is minimal compared to a fireplace or fast food restaurant.   
25 
 
26 
Mr. Howland explained that the applicant will be renting approximately 5,800 square feet of space 
27 
with approximately 4,000 square feet consisting of the funeral home, offices, a conference room, 
28 
and a chapel.  He shared a photograph of the crematory that is 4’W x 10’D x 5’H.  The machine 
29 
will be housed in a small space within the warehouse portion of the mortuary.

Mark Hales asked if anyone will be living in the funeral home.  Mr. Rodriguez replied that staff 
1 
does not sleep on the premises.  The hours of operation will be from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday 
2 
through Friday; however, staff is available around the clock with three people will be on call at 
3 
night.  The employees take the transport vehicle home to use for transports that are requested after 
4 
hours.   
5 
 
6 
City Manager, Mark Reid asked if there is a retail component associated with the funeral home.  
7 
Mr. Howland noted that sales and service are taxable.  The company pays sales tax and property 
8 
tax and all merchandise that is sold is taxable.  They also pay property taxes on the crematory and 
9 
some of the equipment in the funeral home.   
10 
 
11 
Mr. Howland noted that the other two businesses in the building consist of an insurance firm and 
12 
a construction company.  He added that Mr. Rodriguez has been given the first right of refusal if 
13 
they wish to expand. 
14 
 
15 
Mr. Howland reported that a letter of reference from Jenkins-Soffe Funeral Chapel and Cremation 
16 
Center was provided to Mr. Crowell just before the meeting for distribution to the Council 
17 
Members.  Mr. Rodriguez thanked the Council for their consideration and assured them that the 
18 
company will represent the City very well.

2.2 
Budget Discussion, Staff Presenters, Bruce Kartchner and Stephanie Thayer. 
21 
 
22 
Finance Director, Bruce Kartchner reported that staff continues to work on the budget.  They 
23 
recently found that the property taxes have met the budget for 2020 and there is one more month 
24 
to collect.  Staff was also working on analyzing the sales tax information and have received 
25 
preliminary data for March.  The numbers had not yet been finalized as staff was still determining 
26 
the expectation for sales tax revenue for the remainder of 2020 and the 2021 projections.  Since 
27 
Bluffdale’s data was not included in the projections from the State of Utah, staff had to extrapolate 
28 
the information and identify whether any changes needed to be made for 2021.  The figure was 
29 
currently being left with a 20% reduction of 2020 sales tax numbers.

Mayor Timothy noted that other cities agreed to calculate a 20% reduction and asked if 
1 
Mr. Kartchner considered 20% to be a safe number.  Mr. Kartchner explained that it may be an 
2 
overly pessimistic number and he expects it will be somewhat lower.  He added that the projections 
3 
for the State of Utah are expected to be poor at the end of this fiscal year and the first part of 2021; 
4 
however, it is expected to recover and grow fairly quickly in the last nine months of 2021.   
5 
 
6 
Mr. Kartchner further explained that individual projections depend on the make-up of cities and 
7 
how they collect sales tax revenue.  Since Bluffdale is different due to the sales tax revenue that 
8 
comes from online sales, the City gets 0.5% that normally goes to cities with brick and mortar 
9 
stores.  As retailers have shut down, consumers have shifted to ordering online.  Although the 
10 
numbers for online sales were not in yet, Mr. Kartchner expected the 20% figure may be reduced.   
11 
 
12 
Chief Accountant/Human Resources Director, Stephanie Thayer highlighted additional changes to 
13 
the revenue and expenditures and noted that the re-appropriation of the fund balance to balance the 
14 
budget has been reduced to $168,000.   
15 
 
16 
• Two seasonal park positions and one seasonal Streets Worker were added back into the 
17 
budget.  All other positions were still postponed.  Last year, there were seven to 10 seasonal 
18 
workers who were mostly used for Old West Days.  Some of the seasonal employees were 
19 
brought in as permanent part-time employees. 
20 
• Changes in the Fire Department were made and reallocated within their budgets; therefore, 
21 
the change was flat.  The changes were for equipment and some revised estimates.  The 
22 
overall budget remained flat for additional personnel due to the reallocation of funds.  The 
23 
Fire Department currently has one Battalion Chief position that is part-time and the addition 
24 
of a second position was added.  Since the positions are part-time, there are no medical or 
25 
dental benefits; however, there will be some benefits such as social security.   
26 
• The antibody test kits in the City Council budget were originally added to the 2021 fiscal 
27 
year but could be moved to 2020 as an invoice was recently received.  The kits may end up 
28 
in both years if additional test kits are purchased.  Mr. Reid pointed out that there is no net 
29 
effect on the budget since the invoice is for $14,000 and the City budgeted $50,000.  Any 
30

BLUFFDALE CITY COUNCIL

6 
kits purchased next fiscal year would be offset by revenues.  Ms. Thayer would correct the 
1 
item for the next review.  Mr. Reid recommended listing the kits in both years. 
2 
• There is an item in the Capital Projects Fund from the Fire Department to purchase a 
3 
response vehicle for the New Battalion Chief position.  Ms. Thayer noted that the fire 
4 
engine that did not receive grant funding was removed from the revenue side and replaced 
5 
on the expenditure side for another type of engine at a cost of $400,000.   
6 
• Mr. Kartchner pointed out that the Fire Department’s Interim Chief highlighted additional 
7 
positions that may be desired by the New Chief.  The positions were not being filled at this 
8 
point; however, they may be reevaluated along with City employee raises at the mid-year 
9 
point in 2021 as discussed previously. 
10 
• Ms. Thayer removed a cemetery item that was on the last budget revision.  Mr. Kartchner 
11 
noted that the item was for software the City was going to pay for but was delayed until 
12 
next year.   
13 
 
14 
Dave Kallas asked if the request for a New Battalion Chief is a part-time position.  Chief James 
15 
explained that it is part-time.  The standard is to have a Chief respond to and assist with calls and 
16 
scheduling.  The schedule is typically eight hours per day and 16 hours on call at night, which 
17 
provides the benefit of having a Chief available 24 hours per day/7 days per week while only 
18 
paying 16 hours of wages for two days. 
19 
 
20 
Council Member Kallas asked about the status of the fire engine.  Chief James stated that the 
21 
department intends to sell one of their old fire trucks to Fire Trucks Unlimited to provide revenue 
22 
that will go toward the cost of the new fire engine.  The new engine could be used to participate in 
23 
Emergency Management System responses where the Fire Department would get paid well to help 
24 
during the fire season in California and Washington in the fall.  The program pays for the use of 
25 
the fire truck and personnel and, depending on the length of deployment, can provide a profit of 
26 
$40,000 to $100,000.  
27 
 
28 
Mayor Timothy did not believe Bluffdale ever participated in the program because firemen were 
29 
not available due to their employment with other fire stations.  Chief James stated that 25 to 30 
30 
DRAFT – FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY 
 
BLUFFDALE CITY COUNCIL

Wednesday, May 13, 2020 
 
7 
firefighters are interested and qualified to go if the opportunity arises.  They will take a vacation 
1 
from their departments for the time they are away.  Chief James added that, as a member of the 
2 
Metro Fire Agency, a Type 6 fire engine such as the Ox at Station 91 could be sent with personnel 
3 
from other communities.  The State pays the liability insurance, workers' compensation, and other 
4 
expenses and writes a check for 80% for expenses for an immediate profit.   
5 
 
6 
Wendy Aston asked what preparations are needed and if the Department could participate in this 
7 
upcoming fire season.  Chief James replied that the Department has already surveyed its equipment 
8 
and would just need to purchase a new pump for the Type 6 engine at a cost of approximately 
9 
$5,000 to $6,000 and a new hose for $1,200.     
10 
 
11 
Mr. Reid noted that the new engine would not be ready this year due to the build time.  Chief James 
12 
stated that it takes eight to nine months because they need to buy a commercial chassis and build 
13 
the box.  He estimated it will take eight to 10 months including the bidding and inspecting process.   
14 
 
15 
Mr. Reid was not sure the City would be comfortable sending a new engine to California and 
16 
mentioned that the reimbursement from the Ross Program took six to eight months.  Chief James 
17 
explained that this program is through FEMA rather than the Forest Service, and FEMA provides 
18 
the reimbursement much more quickly.  He noted that the Department is willing to participate in 
19 
the Ross program but it does take longer to get revenue.   
20 
 
21 
Chief James recommended tabling the Type 1-3 engine to the next budget year.  He suggested 
22 
moving forward with selling the oldest engine and participating in the FEMA program to offset 
23 
the cost of the new engine.  Mr. Reid asked if Chief James was comfortable only having one Ox 
24 
in the station.  Chief James confirmed that he was very comfortable.   
25 
 
26 
Jeff Gaston asked which engine is being sold.  Chief James stated that it is the old red and white 
27 
engine and noted that it is not safe or reliable.  Mr. Reid stated that it will likely sell for less than 
28 
$50,000.  Chief James agreed and noted that it should be sold quickly to avoid losing any more 
29 
value.  Mr. Reid confirmed that the other two engines do not qualify for the FEMA program since 
30 
they need brush fire engines.  Chief James replied that a brush or wildland engine is required.

Jeff Gaston requested that items 3.5 and 3.6 be removed from the Consent Agent.  Traci Crockett 
11 
asked that Item 3.3 also be removed.

Mark Hales moved to approve Item Nos. 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 on the Consent Agenda.  Dave

16 
 
17 
Traci Crockett asked for verification on the initial cost and monthly payment for the Advanced 
18 
Traffic Management System.  City Engineer, Michael Fazio stated that the initial cost is $10,200 
19 
and the annual payment is $1,320 per year.  The annual payment is required whether or not the 
20 
system is being utilized. 
21 
 
22 
Traci Crockett moved to approve Item 3.3.  Dave Kallas seconded the motion.  Vote on

Crockett-Aye.  The motion passed unanimously. 
25 
 
26 
Jeff Gaston noted that the Hazard Mitigation Plan referenced in Item 3.5 looks different than the 
27 
one that was previously passed.  He asked about the differences including the roles of the City 
28 
departments involved and noted that the Public Works and Emergency Management Departments 
29 
do not appear to be included.  Ms. Hall replied that the plan is updated every five years as required 
30 
by FEMA and this version is more specific to the City of Bluffdale.  The Public Works and 
31 
Emergency Management Departments are involved with the Fire Department and have the most 
32 
responsibility in responding to hazards.

Jeff Gaston asked if the plan provides more power or control to any of the departments and how it 
1 
affects department heads.  Ms. Hall explained that it specifies hazards that exist in the City and 
2 
which department is responsible for mitigation.  Mr. Reid added that the plan provides more 
3 
specific guidance on hazards such as the Jordan Valley chlorine system and the Union Pacific 
4 
Railroad.

The motion passed unanimously. 
9 
 
10 
Jeff Gaston asked who requested the changes to Item 3.6.  Chief James stated that the request is 
11 
from the Fire Department and involves the previous style guide that had a blue logo.  He explained 
12 
that blue does not look good on fire engines and noted that the request is to change the color from 
13 
blue to red and to add some limited branding to add a “B” for Bluffdale in red or black on the fire 
14 
trucks.   
15 
 
16 
Chief James pointed out that the t-shirt design will remain the same, except for the addition of a 
17 
small “B” to incorporate the branding.  Council Member Gaston did not like the idea of putting a 
18 
“B” in the patch and preferred not to make any changes to the patch.  He was comfortable with the 
19 
minor change to the t-shirts and polos.   
20 
 
21 
Council Member Gaston asked where the B will be placed on the fire trucks.  Chief James 
22 
explained that the logo will be small and placed on the back of ambulances and fire trucks.  The 
23 
logos on the doors will consist of the patch design.   
24 
 
25 
Traci Crockett agreed with keeping the current design of the patch.  Mayor Timothy confirmed 
26 
that the resolution is acceptable as long as the B is removed from the patch.  
27 
 
28 
Jeff Gaston asked if the new fire engine will be painted the same as the one in Independence.  Chief 
29 
James confirmed that it would.

PUBLIC HEARING – Consideration and Vote on a Proposed General Plan Land Use

Amendment Application for 1.71 Acres from Neighborhood Commercial to 
7 
Commercial, located at approximately 13912 South 2700 West, Jeremy Bitner, 
8 
Applicant, Staff Presenter, Grant Crowell. 
9 
 
10 
Mayor Timothy noted that agenda item numbers 4 and 5 will be heard together and the public 
11 
hearing will incorporate both items.  The items will be voted on separately. 
12 
 
13 
City Planner/Economic Development Director, Grant Crowell reported that Jeremy Bitner is 
14 
requesting a General Plan Land Use Amendment and a zoning request for a vacant property on 
15 
2700 West.  The property is the last remaining in the commercial zone that has not been changed 
16 
to commercial.   
17 
 
18 
Mr. Crowell displayed the existing General Plan Map and explained that, other than a parcel to the 
19 
north owned by the Utah Department of Transportation (“UDOT”), this property is the last piece 
20 
of land on the west side.  He noted that the UDOT property will not be redeveloped into anything 
21 
other than road infrastructure.   
22 
 
23 
Mr. Crowell reported that the Planning Commission had a public discussion on the shape of the 
24 
parcel and it was suggested that a piece of the property be cut to correct the shape; however, the 
25 
General Plan has always included the “dog ear” portion as being the same designation as the rest 
26 
of the parcel.  Mr. Crowell explained that if that part of the property was left as residential use, it 
27 
would be non-conforming and too small for a home.   
28 
 
29 
Mr. Crowell noted that the City Council adopted the updated Transportation Plan that included 
30 
13900 South.  He explained that Transportation Impact Fees could be used for infrastructure 
31 
because the entire block is expected to develop and will need infrastructure in the middle.

13 
Mr. Crowell stated that Mr. Bitner and the neighbors have spoken to the City about potential 
1 
alignments.  The applicant was proposing a small office building on the west side of the property; 
2 
however, nothing had been adopted or finalized.   
3 
 
4 
Jeremy Bitner appreciated the assistance he has received from City staff.  He has a good 
5 
relationship with the neighbor and there is only one home next to the property under consideration.  
6 
Mr. Bitner had spoken with the neighbor, Murray Winters who confirmed that he is in favor of the 
7 
area going commercial and would like Mr. Bitner to develop the property.  Mr. Winters was also 
8 
considering changing his property to commercial use.   
9 
 
10 
Jeff Gaston thanked Mr. Bitner for being willing to change the property to commercial and for 
11 
investing in the property.  He had hoped this area would be developed into a commercial property, 
12 
and he supported Mr. Bitner’s request. 
13 
 
14 
Dave Kallas asked if Mr. Bitner had any opinion or preference concerning the alignment of 13900 
15 
South.  He added that it would be nice to have the road go straight through rather than turn at an 
16 
angle.  Mr. Bitner stated that it helps in some ways to have it at a 90-degree angle.  The commercial 
17 
lot is approximately 20,000 square feet in size and if the road is 57 feet, it would take away from 
18 
the lot.  The goal was to get most of the road on the UDOT property.   
19 
 
20 
Mr. Bitner noted that there are also limits on 2700 West because the Maverik Gas Station does not 
21 
want to give up any property.  He added that Diamond Rental has approached him on a 30,000 
22 
square foot piece of land they would like to purchase and they would also like access from a public 
23 
road.  Mr. Bitner outlined additional challenges associated with putting in a straight road.  He 
24 
stated that the design being presented appears to be the most satisfactory to all parties involved.   
25 
 
26 
Mayor Timothy opened the public hearing.  Mr. Kartchner and Ms. Hall noted that no comments 
27 
were submitted via e-mail or Zoom.  Mayor Timothy left the public hearing open while the Council 
28 
continued the discussion to provide the public additional time to comment.

Jeff Gaston asked Mr. Bitner to provide details about the proposed office building and asked if 
1 
individual spaces would be available.  Mr. Bitner reported that he is a licensed Marriage and Family 
2 
Therapist through Alliance Family Counseling of Utah and noted that he will likely use the site as 
3 
a counseling clinic.  He added that the building will be 4,000 to 5,000 square feet in size and will 
4 
be owner-occupied or subleased to other medical professionals. 
5 
 
6 
Wendy Aston asked if the design of the road will help prevent speeding.  Mr. Fazio stated that the 
7 
City will need to post a reduced speed limit of 15 to 20 MPH so that motorists slow down before 
8 
the curve.  Signs should also be posted indicating that there is a sharp curve.   
9 
 
10 
Mayor Timothy noted that it is similar to the sharp turn behind Redwood Road behind the Maverik 
11 
gas station.  Mr. Fazio agreed and stated that designing it with the curve provides access to the 
12 
property that UDOT owns and the City may be able to acquire the right-of-way.

14 
No public comments were received.  Mayor Timothy closed the public hearing.

Budget Discussion, Staff Presenters, Bruce Kartchner and Stephanie Thayer. 
2 
 
3 
Mr. Kartchner reported that there are no pros or cons to Chief James’ recommendations on 
4 
purchasing a fire truck and reminded the Council that impact fees can be used if the purchase 
5 
exceeds $500,000.  If the purchase does not exceed that amount, other sources of funding will need 
6 
to be used such as the Capital Projects Fund.   
7 
 
8 
Wendy Aston asked if there is money in the budget for an additional Battalion Chief.  
9 
Mr. Kartchner replied that the money is in the budget, and the position will be filled.  He added 
10 
that one of the Inspector positions and the Plan Reviewer position will not be filled but will be 
11 
reviewed mid-year.  Mr. Reid asked if any current firefighters are qualified for either of those 
12 
positions and if they could be paid for an additional shift to save money on hiring expenses.  Chief 
13 
James noted that the difference is only $1.25 an hour and it could likely be fit into the budget.   
14 
 
15 
Chief James stated that he currently performs inspections and relies on crew members on occasion.  
16 
The position also performs sprinkler system inspections and plumbing reviews in addition to other 
17 
duties.   
18 
 
19 
Dave Kallas asked for clarification on the Reappropriation Fund and the difference between the 
20 
current and previous budgets presented.  Mr. Kartchner explained that the budget must balance 
21 
and the City is required to keep a reserve of cash on hand to use when expenses exceed revenues.  
22 
The City is required by State statute to have at least 5% but not more than 25% available in reserves 
23 
at the end of each year to carry over to the next year.   
24 
 
25 
The City currently has expenditures that exceed revenues in the amount of $168,347.  Staff has 
26 
been able to reduce that amount significantly from the previous deficit of $650,000.  Mr. Kartchner 
27 
noted that this amount could increase or decrease depending on the Certified Tax Rate that the 
28 
County provides the first part of June and the additional property taxes the City collects. 
29 
 
30 
Staff continued to go through details of the budget to identify items that can be removed or 
31 
deferred.  Mr. Kartchner noted that the service levels for parks and other public areas will be lower

than last year and the Council Members may receive occasional calls about issues in the parks due 
1 
to the reduced manpower.   
2 
 
3 
Mr. Reid pointed out that money spent on Park Workers on Old West Days will be down 
4 
significantly and will likely offset the decrease in Park Workers.  One of the seasonal workers will 
5 
work on Saturdays, which is a service the City has not previously provided.   
6 
 
7 
Dave Kallas was pleased to see that the appropriation was reduced so dramatically.  Mr. Kartchner 
8 
noted that the department heads have been very diligent about minimizing requests for their 
9 
departments.  He was comfortable with the current deficit but had some concerns about the 
10 
financial impact COVID-19 may have had on the City. Mr. Reid was tempted to increase the sales 
11 
tax projections but the impact of COVID-19 is so uncertain that he decided to wait until January.  
12 
Staff would continue to work to find ways to reduce expenses. 
13 
 
14 
Council Member Kallas was not overly concerned about the current deficit since the City is 
15 
maintaining a balance of between five and 25 percent.  Mayor Timothy preferred to keep the sales 
16 
tax with a 20% reduction knowing that it can be added back mid-year if needed.  Even if $168,000 
17 
had to be spent to balance the budget, the City’s reserves will remain at 16%.  
18 
 
19 
Mr. Kartchner agreed and was more concerned with the lease payment and bond for the Public 
20 
Works Building and other expenses for capital projects.  He added that the 20% discount on sales 
21 
tax is acceptable and he believes the City will be fine next year.  The numbers projected for March 
22 
were better than expected but the numbers for April will provide a better indication. 
23 
 
24 
Mr. Kartchner thanked the Council for giving clear direction to make Public Safety the top priority.  
25 
He also expressed appreciation for the department heads’ sacrifices toward this goal.

Chief James reported that he was requesting a minor functional change to the Employee Policies 
31

17 
since the shift rotation is a six-day rotation, Chief James was asking to change the 28-day cycle to 
1 
a 24-day cycle.  Chief James reported that the number of hours will remain the same as a 
2 
percentage, and the change will make scheduling easier for Captain Roberts. 
3 
 
4 
Ms. Thayer reported that as a member of the Utah State Retirement System (“URS”), it was 
5 
requested that the City provide a policy to allow employees and certain non-merit positions to be 
6 
exempt from the retirement system if they choose.  Each participating employer is required to 
7 
designate which positions can be included in the option.

16 
Sheeran.  
17 
 
18 
City Attorney, Todd Sheeran reported that the Council previously discussed the City’s 
19 
Organizational Chart and voted to have the City Manager maintain it.  A draft was circulated and 
20 
the matter includes a text amendment for final approval. 
21 
 
22 
Dave Kallas noted that the creation of departments and positions should be approved by the City 
23 
Council due to budget impacts and asked why the change to allow the City Manager to make those 
24 
decisions was proposed.  Mr. Reid stated that the City Manager needs to request approval from the 
25 
City Council for the budget if a position or department is created; therefore, the City Manager 
26 
cannot create a department or position without City Council approval. 
27 
 
28 
Jeff Gaston did not like the proposed language and noted that it appears to give all the power to 
29 
the City Manager.  He requested an organizational chart with no names and he did not support the 
30 
approval of the text amendment.

Council Member Gaston moved to deny the change to the ordinance.  The motion died for 
1 
lack of a second.   
2 
 
3 
Mayor Timothy thought the wording matched what the City Council previously agreed on.  Dave 
4 
Kallas agreed with having the City Manager organize and set up the organizational structure; 
5 
however, he suggested amending the text to specify that the City Manager may create departments 
6 
and positions with the consent of the City Council.  The Council Members agreed with the 
7 
recommendation. 
8 
 
9 
Jeff Gaston asked Mr. Reid to provide a chart with positions only that the Council can approve or 
10 
deny when there are changes.  Council Member Gaston preferred that the ordinance remain as it 
11 
was originally written and did not see a need for the amendment.  Mark Hales did not believe the 
12 
Council should have to vote on the flow chart every year.  Council Member Kallas agreed that it 
13 
is beneficial to see the chart but he did not believe the Council needs to approve it. 
14 
 
15 
The Council Members discussed whether the change to the original Code was necessary.  Jeff 
16 
Gaston offered to write a revised ordinance.  Mr. Reid stated that he would have staff prepare a 
17 
resolution that incorporates the suggestions from Council Members Kallas and Hales for 
18 
distribution to the Council Members.

Room; however, due to COVID-19, it was held through Zoom.  Ms. Fisher did an amazing 
1 
job of ensuring that the students were well-versed on Zoom and the event was flawless.  
2 
Mayor Timothy thanked staff for assisting with the letters from the Mayor that were sent 
3 
to students.  He also thanked Natalie Hall, Terri Bawden, and Allison Wilcox for their help 
4 
as well as Mr. Reid for loaning out his staff. 
5 
• Mayor Timothy noted that information was erroneously published in the newsletter 
6 
regarding Salt Lake County’s requirements on licensing flocks and inspecting pens.  He 
7 
asked if any Council Members received complaints and Jeff Gaston and Wendy Aston 
8 
confirmed that they did.  Mayor Timothy reported that the publication was a mistake 
9 
because the City does not require the licensing and inspection of pens and has different 
10 
requirements than the County.  He asked the Council Members to let those who have 
11 
complained know that it was a mistake that will be retracted.   
12 
• Mr. Sheeran reported that the licensing of animals and a permit is required for chickens but 
13 
he believes the requirements were being reviewed and revised by the County.  Mr. Crowell 
14 
stated that the City has local land use control over animals.  The City uses the County’s 
15 
licensing but the publication was a mistake and should not have been printed.   
16 
• There had been discussions about allowing pygmy goats and chickens, except for roosters, 
17 
on R-1-10 properties.  Mayor Timothy thought they were allowed on residential properties 
18 
but recently learned that the City does not allow them.  He believes it is reasonable to have 
19 
a few chickens but no roosters and asked Mr. Reid to have staff write a proposal to allow 
20 
them.  He advised Mr. Reid not to make any changes to R-1-43 properties.  Dave Kallas 
21 
asked that infill overlays also be allowed for R-1-10 properties.  Mayor Timothy asked 
22 
Mr. Reid to make sure that the infill overlays are included in the proposal. 
23 
• A few negative comments had been received about the cancellation of Old West Days but 
24 
Mayor Timothy has also received many positive comments supporting his decision.

• Jeff Gaston reported that the Mosquito Abatement Program provides residents who have 
1 
ponds with free fish that eat mosquitoes.  The program is free to all Salt Lake County 
2 
residents.  The City can also request fogging for neighborhoods where mosquito issues are 
3 
prevalent.  Mayor Timothy asked if the fish are for standing water only or if rivers can be 
4 
treated.  Council Member Gaston stated that the fish can be used in rivers and canals but 
5 
not in the Jordan River due to dangers to the other fish in the river.  Jeff Gaston noted that 
6 
a heavy mosquito season is expected and mosquito traps will be set up near the prison 
7 
where there is heavy floodwater to prevent West Nile cases. 
8 
• The American Legion will not be holding its Memorial Day program this year.  The Public 
9 
Works Department will put out flags and will ensure the cemetery is in great shape. 
10 
• Mr. Reid asked Chief James to provide an update on the COVID-19 response and personal 
11 
protective equipment (“PPE”) supplies.  Chief James stated that the Fire Department is still 
12 
working diligently on COVID-19 cases.  There has been a significant reduction in medical 
13 
calls; however, the response teams are still taking precautions and ensuring that only one 
14 
individual has contact with the patient while wearing PPE.  The department has a good 
15 
supply of N-95 masks, surgical isolation masks, hand sanitizer, and Tyvek.   
16 
• Chief James reported that he met with State Lands Fire and Forestry, and they are 
17 
anticipating a large fire season statewide.  He will be meeting with them again and provide 
18 
the City Council with recommendations on restrictions for the summer.   
19 
• Chief James recognized Captain Evans for his work on handling the Wildland program and 
20 
Captain Roberts for his scheduling efforts during the COVID-19 crisis.  He noted that the 
21 
department met with a vendor on a software package that will help with scheduling. 
22 
• Chief James reported that the fogging systems have been successful and are being used 
23 
frequently.  Mr. Reid asked Chief James if any firefighters have tested positive for COVID-
24 
19.  Chief James replied that only one firefighter has tested positive and the trace routing 
25 
being done appears to show that it was likely contracted through a community spread at a 
26 
restaurant.  Chief James attributed the health of the crews to the effectiveness of PPE. 
27 
• Grant Crowell provided an update on the Bringhurst project and noted that commercial 
28 
buildings and homes are going in.  He reported that 78 townhomes are currently being

developed and are under construction or review.  Three permits have been submitted for 
1 
commercial shell buildings that consist of approximately 140,000 square feet.   
2 
• Mr. Reid reported that the Fire Chief position has been advertised and only two out of state 
3 
individuals have applied so far.  More applications were expected as the deadline 
4 
approaches. 
5 
• Mr. Fazio provided an update on Spring View Farms and the restriping that was requested 
6 
by the City Council for a turn lane at the entrance of the development.  Mr. Reid reported 
7 
that the curb and gutter have been installed on Porter Rockwell Boulevard Segment Four 
8 
and asphalt has been poured from 14600 South to the river abutment where the bridge will 
9 
cross over.  He also noted that the floor has been poured on the water tank and the project 
10 
is progressing. 
11 
• Mr. Fazio stated that there is sufficient space for two lanes and a median at the Spring View 
12 
Farms entrance.  The north side will have approximately two feet of shoulder on the road.  
13 
Mr. Fazio requested approval to send the street crew to change the road.  It was reported 
14 
Mr. Fazio provided the design.   
15 
 
16 
Traci Crockett shared concerns about the impact on the bike lane where the turn lane will be 
17 
located.  Mr. Fazio replied that due to the narrow part of the road, the lane will either need to be 
18 
designated as a shared bike lane or a ramp will need to be installed to allow access back to the 
19 
road.  Mr. Reid stated that the shared lane will only be a few hundred feet long and drivers should 
20 
be able to see any bicyclists.   
21 
 
22 
The Council Members discussed whether the lane needs further review and discussed alternative 
23 
options.  Jeff Gaston suggested using paint to make the changes to the road and bike lane as a low-
24 
cost option that could easily be changed if issues arise.  Mr. Reid stated that staff will paint the 
25 
road before August when the middle school opens. 
26 
 
27 
• Mr. Reid reported that 250 COVID-19 testing kits were purchased and the cities are 
28 
working on a date and time for testing.  Ms. Hall will initiate a social media campaign to 
29 
spread the word to the public.  A testing date of May 27 was currently being considered.

• Public Works Director, Shane Paddock reported that a disaster was averted on Sunday, 
1 
May 10 when a passerby reported a leak at the new tank site.  A gopher dug a tunnel in the 
2 
embankment that breached the tank.  Streets Superintendent, Kurt Deters responded 
3 
immediately and filled the hole.  If it had continued to leak, it would have enlarged and the 
4 
canal would have been breached under pressure causing the formwork to be damaged.  
5 
Mr. Paddock recognized the swift action of Mr. Deters and noted that he is a very diligent 
6 
and hard-working employee.  He added that the canal master was contacted and shut down 
7 
the canal until the breach was repaired.   
8 
• Mr. Reid stated that all of the “Closed” signs at City Hall have been removed.  Although a 
9 
formal announcement has not yet been made, the building is open for full-time business.  
10 
Social distancing signs will be left up permanently at the front counter for both health and 
11 
confidentiality purposes.   
12 
• Employees are returning to City Hall after working from home.  Three employees are 
13 
currently working at the front counter and more employees are expected to return on June 
14 
10 or 11.  Mr. Reid reported that there has been some contention between employees who 
15 
get to continue working from home and those who do not.  He pointed out that employees 
16 
are needed in the office to handle traffic coming into the building.

27 
City Attorney, Todd Sheeran, made a PowerPoint presentation and reported that he was contacted

by Council Member Kallas regarding the City Code on this topic.  The first slide provided an 
29 
overview of Mr. Sheeran’s personal and professional background and interest in addressing the 
30 
types of handicaps people may experience and who may need reasonable accommodation. 
31 
 
32 
Mr. Sheeran provided a historical overview of housing discrimination and stated that in 1968, 
33 
Congress passed the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), which prohibited discrimination based on race, 
34 
gender, or national origin.  Unfortunately, the original legislation did not address discrimination 
35 
against disabled persons.  That deficiency was remedied by the Fair Housing Act Amendment of 
36 
1988 (“FHAA”), which was intended to end the unnecessary exclusion of persons with handicaps.  
37 
The FHAA is referenced in multiple federal agencies and laws.

SPECIAL MEETING MINUTES 
Tuesday, May 19, 2020

1 
Mr. Sheeran reviewed the following three types of discrimination claims that occur: 
2 
 
3 
• Disparate Treatment: Intentional discrimination against handicapped persons from 
4 
living in a residential zone.   
5 
• Disparate Impact: Unintentional discrimination resulting from classifying a 
6 
treatment facility as a medical facility instead of a residential facility, thereby 
7 
denying a disabled person to receive the same kind of treatment as a non-disabled 
8 
person. 
9 
• Failure-to-Accommodate:  Refusal to grant reasonable accommodations, such as a 
10 
variance request to provide a disabled person the same opportunity that a non-
11 
disabled person has.  The majority of claims fall into this category, particularly 
12 
within the zoning context. 
13 
 
14 
Mr. Sheeran reviewed elements associated with a failure-to-accommodate claim.  First and 
15 
foremost, to qualify for accommodation, a person must meet the definition of “handicap” as stated 
16 
in the FHAA.  In the ADA, “disabled” is used instead of “handicapped.”  A handicap occurs if a 
17 
major life activity is substantially impaired.  People who are on a controlled substance do not 
18 
qualify for accommodation under FHAA.  There is an ongoing debate in the courts on the 
19 
dichotomy between a person who is recovering from substance addiction and a person who is 
20 
currently experiencing a substance addiction. 
21 
 
22 
The following three elements are used to judge whether discrimination has occurred against 
23 
handicapped individuals: 
24 
 
25 
1. 
Reasonable: Whether the change would be a substantial or fundamental alteration 
26 
to the zoning schemes as they pertain to safety, parking, and traffic. 
27 
 
28 
2. 
Necessary: Whether something is indispensable as opposed to being merely 
29 
helpful.

3. 
Equal Opportunity: Ensuring disabled persons have the same—not better—
1 
opportunity for housing. 
2 
 
3 
Mr. Sheeran explained that one issue cities wrestle with is determining the number of handicapped 
4 
residents who can live in the same home.  Accommodations typically occur with requests for 
5 
variances on the number of handicapped residents allowed in a home.  Making determinations for 
6 
accommodations is an extremely complex legal matter. 
7 
 
8 
When determining whether an accommodation request is warranted, the following may be 
9 
considered: 
10 
 
11 
• 
The type of facility seeking accommodation, such as: 
12 
o 
Detox facility, 
13 
o 
Short-term in-patient or out-patient, 
14 
o 
Long-term in-patient or out-patient, 
15 
o 
Group home, or  
16 
o 
Elderly care facility. 
17 
• 
Potential modifications to the home that may be needed, particularly whether or not 
18 
it will look like a residential home after the modifications are made. 
19 
• 
Determining whether the facility can appropriately be in a residential neighborhood, 
20 
or if it needs to be therapeutic in nature and scope. 
21 
• 
The number of employees that will be needed, especially live-in employees.  Some 
22 
facilities require staff to be on-site at all times, and some facilities do not have such 
23 
requirements. 
24 
• 
The rationale for the number of residents being requested in the variance.  The 
25 
reason needs to be detailed and justifiable. 
26 
• 
Vehicles and associated traffic. 
27 
• 
Safety concerns, which cannot include the fact that the residents are recovering 
28 
from drug addictions.  Safety can take into account the behavioral patterns of 
29 
prospective residents.

However, when determining whether an accommodation request is warranted, the following things 
2 
may NOT be considered: 
3 
 
4 
• 
House size, which is dictated by the Utah Administrative Code (UAC). 
5 
• 
Additional parking beyond the specifications established by the UAC. 
6 
• 
Zoning. 
7 
• 
Lot size. 
8 
• 
Stereotypical safety, as opposed to the safety concerns previously referenced. 
9 
• 
What neighbors think because federal law does not take this issue into account. 
10 
 
11 
If the request meets the requirements under federal law, the accommodation should be granted. 
12 
 
13 
Mr. Sheeran read through the current City Code and found some items that were appropriate and 
14 
some that needed to be changed.  He enumerated things that are appropriate and inappropriate. 
15 
 
16 
Items currently in the City Code that are appropriate include the following: 
17 
 
18 
• 
Permitting residential facilities in all residential zones. 
19 
• 
Requiring compliance with all developmental standards. 
20 
• 
Establishing a resident number cap.  It was noted that this number is not consistent 
21 
between the different types of treatment facilities.  This is an issue that needs to be 
22 
addressed and remedied. 
23 
 
24 
The things currently in the City Code that are inappropriate include the following: 
25 
 
26 
• 
The citing of portions of the Utah Code that no longer exist. 
27 
• 
Requiring the City Council to determine all reasonable accommodations.  Since this 
28 
is a legal determination and not a political determination, it could create 
29 
unnecessary conflicts. 
30 
• 
Absence of a clear application process. 
31 
• 
Lack of clear decision-making authority, guidelines, or procedures.

• 
Limiting the definition of “family” to two unrelated people, among other concerns. 
1 
 
2 
As a result of his analysis of the current City Code, Mr. Sheeran proposed the following changes: 
3 
 
4 
• 
Moving the regulations to their Title and out of the Land Use section of the City 
5 
Code to eliminate confusion about land use and business licensing. 
6 
• 
Clarifying that all FHAA-qualifying facilities have a cap of eight persons.  That 
7 
number is subject to change by the City Council.  The higher the cap the fewer the 
8 
requests for variances that will occur. 
9 
• 
Adding a section for business license application requirements. 
10 
• 
When considering requests for reasonable accommodations, doing the following: 
11 
o 
Laying out the process to obtain a request; 
12 
o 
Having a neutral third-party hearing officer who is trained in this area of the 
13 
law, thereby making this a quasi-judicial determination with a clear path for 
14 
appealing the decision; 
15 
o 
Determining who would pay for the hearing officer’s time. 
16 
• 
Clarifying the appeal process, whether it’s a business license appeal or a reasonable 
17 
accommodation appeal. 
18 
• 
Completing other general clean-up of the City Code. 
19 
 
20 
Mr. Sheeran noted that the City Code changes he proposed were substantially different from the 
21 
current City Code.  Mr. Sheeran explained that the purpose of a Notice of Pending Ordinance about 
22 
a Text Amendment was to notify future business license applicants to have a treatment facility in 
23 
a residential neighborhood that they would have to follow the guidelines passed by the City 
24 
Council at this meeting.  Applicants would therefore not be able to rely on the City Code that is in 
25 
effect as of right now.  With the Notice of Pending Ordinance, the City Council would have six 
26 
months to craft the new City Code.  He would also like to consult with an attorney whose sole 
27 
practice is in this area of the law to ensure nothing is missed.

Council Member Kallas thanked Mr. Sheeran for his work on the proposed ordinance.  He believes 
1 
it is well written and demonstrates Mr. Sheeran’s expertise in this area of the law.  Council Member 
2 
Kallas addressed the following: 
3 
 
4 
1. 
He believes the City may want to be stricter by saying an accommodation is not 
5 
permitted if it does have a fundamental change in character. 
6 
 
7 
2. 
He asked if it might be appropriate to specify that a business could be reviewed if 
8 
there was a legitimate complaint about rules violations. 
9 
 
10 
3. 
He wanted to be clear that transferability referred to the sale of a business.  
11 
Mr. Sheeran confirmed that such was the case.  Council Member Kallas suggested 
12 
that that requirement remain in the City Code. 
13 
 
14 
4. 
He wanted to know if it would be legal to have the business license requirements 
15 
include assurances about security that will be provided on the premises.  
16 
Mr. Sheeran stated that the issue would be regulated by the Utah Administrative 
17 
Code.  The security of the facility would be contingent on the type of facility. 
18 
 
19 
5. 
He opined that the occupancy cap of eight is too high.  Regardless of what the cap 
20 
is, a reasonable accommodation request would be very likely. 
21 
 
22 
6. 
He had mixed feelings about relegating the decision to a Hearing Officer because 
23 
he could see the pros and cons of opting for a Hearing Officer or staying with the 
24 
City Council to make the accommodation decision. 
25 
 
26 
Council Member Kallas asked if a cap could be placed on what would constitute a reasonable 
27 
accommodation for occupation.  Mr. Sheeran was very hesitant to include that in the City Code for 
28 
the following reasons: 
29 
 
30 
1. 
He has never seen it done.

2. 
The accommodation is so specific to the site that setting a generic cap would be 
1 
problematic.  The limit would be determined under the analysis.  The applicant must 
2 
show why the accommodation is therapeutically necessary and not for financial 
3 
reasons.  The 10th Circuit Court, of which Bluffdale is a part, does not take financial 
4 
viability into the accommodation analysis.   
5 
 
6 
Concerning the Resolution being proposed, Council Member Kallas asked if any existing facility 
7 
or applicant in Bluffdale would be subject to the new appeal process.  Mr. Sheeran said it would 
8 
be debatable because of the question of whether the business vested when it filed its application 
9 
and whether it vested in its appeal rights, which is different.  Mr. Sheeran stated that if the City 
10 
Council passed the resolution under consideration, applicants requesting a Reasonable 
11 
Accommodation would likely want to go through a Hearing Officer because if they did not like 
12 
the decision of the City Council, they could appeal to the Appeals and Variance Hearing Officer.  
13 
If they did not like that decision, they would then appeal to the District Court.  Having a Hearing 
14 
Officer would shorten the appeal timeline for applicants who are not happy with the first decision.  
15 
In addition, if the case went to the City Council, it would entail a public hearing in a public meeting.  
16 
Instead, someone who is legally trained in this aspect of the law would make the decision in a 
17 
quasi-judicial capacity. 
18 
 
19 
Council Member Aston agreed with reducing the cap from eight to four or five.  Concerning the 
20 
cost of the Hearing Officer, she does not believe the City should have to share in the cost.  Instead, 
21 
the cost should be the sole responsibility of the business submitting the variance request.  Council 
22 
Member Gaston agreed regarding the responsibility of the applicant to pay the cost of the appeal 
23 
process and to reduce the cap size. 
24 
 
25 
Mr. Sheeran suggested that the motion include the number that should be considered the cap. 
26 
 
27 
In response to Mayor Timothy’s request for clarification on the immediate impact of the 
28 
Resolution, Mr. Sheeran explained that it would give the residents an idea of where the City is 
29 
headed so there is clear guidance on how future appeals and business license applications will be 
30 
treated until the new Ordinance is passed.  Mayor Timothy expressed concern over the motions

including a change and then having it be perceived as a final decision before the new Ordinance is

passed by the City Council.  Mr. Sheeran stated that if the resolution is passed, the process will 
2 
follow the normal text amendment process.  Since it is currently in the Land Use section of the 
3 
City Code, it would likely first go to the Planning Commission for consideration and 
4 
recommendation.  Even if the cap in the motion is five, it would still be subject to change in the

RE: 
Amendment to the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement Between the City of Bluffdale and Salt Lake 
County – For the Disbursement of Transportation Funding 
 
 
On December 13, 2017, Resolution No. 2017-66 was passed by City Council authorizing the execution 
of an Interlocal Cooperation Agreement between the City of Bluffdale and Salt Lake County 
(“Agreement”).  This Agreement provided for the transfer of up to $1,500,000 of County 
transportation funds to the City of Bluffdale for funding of the design, construction and other costs 
related to construction of the 14600 South project, connecting 1690 West to Redwood Road. 
 
This Agreement has a current balance of $957,568. As construction is not complete and is expected 
to be ongoing past the current Agreement expiration date of June 30, 2020, the City has requested 
and was granted an extension of one year, with the Agreement now ending June 30, 2021. 
 
Amendment No. 1 to the agreement has been prepared by Salt Lake County to accommodate this 
extension. 
 
I recommend that City Council approve Amendment No. 1 of the Agreement between Salt Lake 
County and the City of Bluffdale and authorize the Mayor to execute the same.

Annual Budget 
Fiscal Year 2021
 
 Bluffdale Fiscal Year 2021BudgetBluffdale has been experiencing significant growth for the last several yearsand we are expecting the City will continue to grow in the coming fiscal yearbut that the growth will be at a slower rate than the last few years.  The City also is experiencing the financial uncertainty caused by the economic disruption associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. The proposed budget reflects the challenges and needs caused by this growthwhile protecting the investment in existing infrastructure, facilities, and amenities. These needs are balanced against the uncertain revenue caused by the events surrounding the pandemic. The City Council has identified areas where the City should focus its resources in order to provide our citizens with the services and amenities they are requesting. Some highlights of the budget are as follows:Conservative Revenue EstimatesWe conservatively estimate a slight decrease in General Fund revenues for Fiscal Year 2021(“FY2021”).  This decrease isprimarily attributable to a decreasein sales taxcollections, and a decrease in growth-related charges for services. A projected modest increase in property taxes is not sufficient to overcome the projected decrease in sales taxes. We also are projecting a decrease in building permits and other development-related fees.  Some of our revenue streams are continuing to trendupwardbut overall we are expecting revenues to decrease.  Because of revenue uncertainty causedby the pandemic, we have prepared our forecasts in a way that errs on the side of caution, thus protecting the City should there be any deterioration in the economic climate.Focus on Public SafetyOne of the core functions of theCity is to provide both fire and police services to our residents. Bluffdale’s rapid growth has increased demands on our police and fire departments. Those departments continue to receive significant increases in funding.The City Council has authorized appropriate incentives to attract and retain personnel. They have also authorized the acquisition of vehicles and equipment, as needed, to allow the police officers and firefighters to perform their duties. Parks & TrailsDevelopmentNew housing developers will also be finishing several parks and trails as part of their projects.  The addition of these parks and trails requires hiring additional parks personnel to maintain our parks and trails.Public WorksThe growth continues to increase the miles of road in the City.  These additional roadways require maintenance and snow removal.  The water infrastructure continues to increase to serve the population and commercial growth.  Additional personnel and equipment are included in the budget to assure that these assets are properly maintained and repaired.To support the growth the City has been experiencing over the past 8 years, our parks, streets, and water infrastructure have increased significantly.  During this time,the City has hired additional personnel
