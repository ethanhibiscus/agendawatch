# Self-Supervised Document Similarity Ranking (SDR) via Contextualized Language Models and Hierarchical Inference

This repo is a modified implementation of [**SDR**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01186) designed to work on any arbitrary dataset. The repo also provides an easy interface for inference without evaluation (e.g document ranking) via DocumentRanking.py
