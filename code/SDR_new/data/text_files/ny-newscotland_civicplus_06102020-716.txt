CENSUS 101: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
The 2020 Census is closer than you think!
Here’s a quick refresher of what it is and why it’s essential that everyone is counted.
The U.S. Constitution requires a census 
every 10 years. The census covers the 
entire country and everyone living here. 
The first census was in 1790.
It’s in the
Constitution.
Census data 
determine how 
more than $675 
billion are spent, 
supporting your 
state, county and 
community’s vital 
programs.
It means 
$675 billion. 
Every 10 years, the results 
of the census are used to 
reapportion the House of 
Representatives, 
determining how many 
seats each state gets.
It’s about fair 
representation.
Completing the census is required: 
it’s a way to participate in our 
democracy and say “I COUNT!”
Taking part is 
your civic duty.
The census counts 
every person living 
in the U.S. once, only 
once, and in the 
right place.
Everyone 
counts.
It’s about 
redistricting. 
After each census, state officials use the 
results to redraw the boundaries of their 
congressional and state legislative districts, 
adapting to population shifts.
ATTACHMENT A
Your data are 
confidential.
Federal law protects your census 
responses. Your answers can only 
be used to produce statistics.
By law we cannot share your 
information with immigration 
enforcement agencies, law 
enforcement agencies, or allow it 
to be used to determine your 
eligibility for government benefits.
Residents use the census to 
support community initiatives 
involving legislation, quality-of-life 
and consumer advocacy.
Businesses use census 
data to decide where to 
build factories, offices and 
stores, which create jobs. 
Local governments 
use the census for 
public safety and 
emergency 
preparedness. 
Real estate 
developers  use the 
census to build new 
homes and 
revitalize old 
neighborhoods. 
Census data are being 
used all around you.
2020 will be 
easier than ever.
In 2020, you will be able to 
respond to the census 
online.
You can help.
You are the expert—we need your 
ideas on the best way to make sure 
everyone in your community gets 
counted.
