SUBJECT: 
Lon D. Wright Power Plant Water Truck  
 
Recommendation: Authorize purchase of water truck for Lon D. Wright Power Plant. 
 
BACKGROUND:  
 
Lon D. Wright Power Plant (LDW) is required by the City of Fremont Air Quality Class 1 
Operating Permit to utilize water as a method of dust control at the power plant and 
adjacent facilities. Water is currently applied using a 1994 truck with 402,000 miles. 
 
Due to the age and condition of the existing water truck LDW staff created a technical 
specification for the purchase of a complete water truck that includes chassis, 4,000-
gallon tank and water pump.  
 
The specifications were sent to four vendors including Sourcewell (government pricing) 
for the purchase of the water truck listed above; the table below reflects the pricing

SUBJECT: 
Lon D. Wright Power Plant Motorgrader  
 
Recommendation: Authorize purchase of Motorgrader for Lon D. Wright Power Plant. 
 
BACKGROUND:  
 
Lon D. Wright Power Plant (LDW) utilizes a motorgrader to maintain the access areas to 
the coal pile, the contour for coal pile runoff and roads and runoff of adjacent facilities. 
The existing motorgrader is a 1977 Caterpillar 140G, actual hours unknown, the motor 
and hydraulics are at the end of service life and will require a major overhaul.  
 
Due to the age and condition of the existing motorgrader LDW staff created a technical 
specification for the purchase of a used, comparable motorgrader. A new motorgrader 
was not considered due to low usage.  
 
LDW staff provided the specification to two vendors for the purchase of the motorgrader 
listed above. LDW staff met with the vendors and test operated each of the available 
units. The table below reflects the pricing received: 
 
Vendor 
Brand 
Cost 
NMC (New Model 12M3) 
Caterpillar 
$290,500.00 + Tax 
NMC Used 
Caterpillar (8860 Hours) 
$110,000.00 + Tax 
Murphy Tractor 
John Deere (4300 Hours) 
$190,000.00 + Tax 
 
A typical major overhaul would take place at approximately 15,000 hours of operation, 
utility staff estimated that we would put approximately 500 hours of operation per year on 
the machine.  
 
At this time the trade in value of the LDW 140G motorgrader is unknown. LDW staff is 
working with NMC to obtain a trade-in value; once that value is determined FDU staff will 
decide on trade-in or auction.  
 
LDW staff requests that the Utilities and Infrastructure Board recommend to the City of 
Fremont Mayor and City Council to authorize staff to sign a purchase agreement and 
issue a purchase order to NMC for a for a 2011 Caterpillar 140M motorgrader for 
$110,000.00 + Tax 
 
FISCAL IMPACT:

SCOPE OF SERVICES 
 
 
PROJECT NAME:  
City of Fremont Wastewater Treatment Plant Wholestone Expansion – Design, Bidding and Construction 
Contract Administration 
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
In 2017 and 2018, the City of Fremont began construction on 3 separate WWTP improvement projects.  In 
the first package, the City expanded the secondary treatment capabilities to provide ammonia and BOD 
removal for projected flows and loads as well improving associated plant infrastructure.  This package was 
Substantially Complete in summer 2019.  The second and third packages included anaerobic lagoons for 
industrial pre-treatment and an additional egg digester to address increased solids loadings.  These 
packages are anticipated to be Substantially Complete in 2020.  During construction of the 3 projects, the 
local pork processing facility (formerly Hormel) was purchased by Wholestone in early 2019.  The new 
ownership of the pork processing plant intends to expand from one shift of kill/cut to two shifts of kill/cut 
which will greatly increase the flows and loads sent to the WWTP.  In addition, the City received a 
Compliance Order requiring year round disinfection of plant effluent be completed by October 2022.    
 
The purpose of this project is to develop the design documents, provide bidding assistance, and 
construction contract administration services for the WWTP improvements needed to address the 
Compliance Order, and projected increases in industrial flows and loads and associated anticipated 
improvements or plant modifications. 
 
The scope of services defined below outlines the activities that will be provided by HDR for these tasks 
based on the following project definitions and assumptions: 
Task 1 – Design and Development of Drawings and Specifications of one (1) HDPE lined and Covered 
Anaerobic Lagoon.

 
Based on additional biogas production from the fourth 
anaerobic lagoon due to increased industrial loads. 
 
The addition of the fourth lagoon will increase the average 
annual biogas design production value from the lagoons 
from the currently permitted limit of 425 standard cubic 
feet per minute (scfm) to approximately 570 scfm.  There 
will be no change to the maximum hourly biogas design 
flow rate of 1,500 scfm, which is limited by the blower 
capacity. 
 
This increase in average annual biogas production will 
require a permit revision to CP18-002 issued to the facility 
on June 19, 2018; because, the numeric permitted pollutant 
limits and annual biogas production would exceed the 
current limits set in Condition III.(C) of the permit based 
upon the increased annual average biogas flow.   
 
The increase in Sulfur Dioxide emissions from this change is 
anticipated to exceed the air modeling thresholds that 
would require the facility to conduct an air modeling 
analysis for the construction permit application.

REIMBURSEMENT AND 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
FOR WASTEWATER ENGINEERING 
This Reimbursement and Indemnification Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made and 
entered into on  this 28 day of April, 2020, between the City of Fremont, a municipal political 
subdivision of the State of Nebraska (“City”), whose address for the purposes of this Agreement 
is 400 East Military Avenue, Fremont NE 68025, and WholeStone Farms, Inc. a Nebraska 
corporation (“WholeStone”), whose address for the purposes of this Agreement is 900 South 
Platte Ave, Fremont, NE 68025. 
 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
The City has engaged the services of HDR Engineering, Inc. to assist the City in the 
design of additional wastewater treatment facilities at the existing City treatment plant for the 
added wastewater volumes related to a second shift proposed by WholeStone. The City and 
Wholestone have agreed to two shift discharge quantities (the “Future (Two Shift) Wastewater 
Discharge” volumes in a Wastewater Services and Cost Share Agreement) requiring need for 
additional wastewater engineering services. WholeStone has agreed to reimburse and indemnify 
the City for fifty percent (50%) of its expenses to engage HDR Engineering, Inc. for the design 
of additional wastewater treatment facilities to satisfy the Future (Two Shift) Wastewater 
Discharge volumes, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. 
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
Now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing Preliminary Statement which is 
included herein by this reference and the mutual covenants of the parties hereto, it is agreed as 
follows: 
 
1. 
WholeStone shall reimburse the City for fifty percent (50%) of its expenses to 
engage the services of HDR Engineering, Inc. in designing additional wastewater treatment 
facilities that satisfies the Future (Two Shift) Wastewater Discharge volumes, not to exceed 
$1,750,000.00. WholeStone shall pay the City within thirty (30) days of its receipt of an invoice 
from the City, including a commercially reasonable level of detail describing the service 
provided in such a manner that Wholestone can determine that the wastewater treatment 
facilities are being constructed in accordance with the Future (Two Shift) Wastewater Discharge  
volumes and the costs related thereto with such detail including at a minimum any invoice and 
supporting documentation, including applicable task orders, from HDR Engineering to the City 
with the gross amount shown on the invoice along with a separate cost schedule showing how 
the amounts invoiced by HDR Engineering should apportioned between engineering costs that 
are or are not attributable (if there are such different costs) to the additional wastewater treatment 
facilities that support the Future (Two Shift) Wastewater Discharge volumes. If WholeStone (a) 
elects to discontinue its pursuit of expanded wastewater volumes for a second shift, whether 
Agenda Item #7

because the additional wastewater facilities are not being constructed in accordance with the 
Future (Two Shift) Wastewater Discharge  volumes or for any other reason, and (b) notifies the 
City (in writing) of such election, then WholeStone shall only be responsible for the City’s out-
of-pocket expenses that accrued prior to the City’s receipt of WholeStone’s notice (not to exceed 
$1,750,000.00 in any event). 
 
2. 
WholeStone hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless from and 
against any and all liabilities, expenses including reasonable attorneys’ and engineers’ fees, 
orders, lawsuits, causes of actions, claims, damages, costs, penalties, fines, interest and demands 
whatsoever suffered, threatened against, or paid, or incurred by the City in connection with, or 
arising from, WholeStone’s failure to reimburse the City in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement. 
 
3. 
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors 
and assigns of the parties. 
 
4. 
All notices or other communications required or permitted by this Agreement 
shall be in writing and in all cases addressed to the party at the location or address indicated 
above. Such notice shall be considered to be properly given by and received by a party (i) 
whenever delivered in person, or (ii) on the date a return receipt is signed by a party when sent 
by certified mail, regardless of when received or delivered.  A party shall have the right to 
change its address for notice or other communication to any other person or location within the 
continental United States by giving prior written notice to the other party. 
 
5. 
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed 
an original and all of which together will constitute one agreement. Each counterpart may be 
delivered by facsimile or computer-scanned image transmission. The signature page of any 
counterpart may be detached therefrom without impairing the legal effect of the signature(s) 
thereon provided such signature page is attached to any other counterpart identical thereto. 
 
6. 
No amendment of this Agreement shall be valid unless it is in writing and is 
signed by the parties or by their duly authorized representatives, and unless it specifies the nature 
and extent of the amendment. 
 
7. 
The City and WholeStone each agree to abide by all federal and state laws, 
statutes, ordinances and regulations governing the activities discussed herein “the Applicable 
Laws”. WholeStone shall comply with, and indemnify the City against any violations by 
Wholestone of applicable regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency or 
other State government agencies regulating any activities engaged in by WholeStone found to 
be in violation of the Applicable Laws. Wholestone shall have the right to assert its own defenses 
against any allegations that it has violated Applicable Laws.  
 
8. 
This Agreement, and the rights and duties of the parties arising from or relating 
in any way to the terms, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement shall be governed by,

SUBJECT: 
Open Season for Northern Natural Gas Capacity 
 
 
 
 
 
Background:  Northern Natural Gas (Northern) announced that 3,500 mmbtu/day 
of firm capacity had been turned in (called Generally Available Capacity), so 
Northern are soliciting bids for this capacity. Unfortunately, the west leg, the 
pipeline Fremont is served from, only has 2,500 mmbtu/day of available firm 
capacity. Generally Available Capacity does not require a capital contribution, so 
we are seeking all 2,500 mmbtu/day of capacity. If other companies also put in 
bids, Northern will likely divide the capacity between bidders, but the company with 
the highest net present value will receive the most. 
 
The additional capacity is necessary for the growth we are seeing as result of the 
LPP/Costco processing facility.  
 
Staff recommends authorizing City Administrator to submit open season bid for 
additional capacity. 
 
Fiscal Impact: Contingent on amount of capacity awarded. Estimated 
$150,000/yr. 
 
Recommendation: Authorize City Administrator to submit open season bid for 
additional capacity with Northern Natural Gas

1/ If no minimum quantity is provided, Northern will assume a minimum quantity of zero.  
 
Capacity will be awarded to the highest bid(s) based on a determination of the best bid, or combination of bids that result 
in the highest net present value (NPV) of reservation revenue, on a per unit of capacity basis. Northern has the right to 
aggregate bids, or portions of bids, that generate the highest total NPV to Northern. The NPV per unit will be determined 
by discounting the cash flow (using the FERC interest rate) generated from the reservation rate multiplied by the volume 
for each month, by bid, and then dividing the NPV by the maximum daily quantity bid. 
 
The term of service for any bid must start on an April 1 or a November 1, and end on a March 31 or an October 31. The bid 
quantity must be equal for each month across the winter season (November-March) and each month across the summer 
season (April-October) of the term of the bid. 
 
Northern reserves the right to reject any bid(s) less than maximum rates.    
 
Northern reserves the right to reject any bid(s) which are subject to contingencies. 
 
Northern will evaluate and award capacity for incremental bids based on the terms of this open season. Any remaining 
capacity will be released as generally available capacity.  
 
Realignments may be considered as part of this open season.  
 
Customer(s) must meet the creditworthiness provisions of Northern’s Tariff. Upon request by Northern, customer shall 
provide appropriate credit assurance, including credit assurance for the construction of facilities, within ten (10) calendar 
days of Northern’s request. If a non-creditworthy customer fails to provide the appropriate security, Northern may award 
the capacity to the next best bid(s) or proceed to remarket the capacity, and customer will be liable for any difference in 
value of the bids, in addition to any other remedies available by law. 
 
X Yes, I agree to include my bid in an expansion project.  The terms below are applicable to an expansion 
project: 
 
The reservation rate bid is binding at Northern’s maximum tariff rates for firm throughput service. The rates necessary for 
service, including realignments, may change based on the actual cost of an expansion project (Project). The actual costs 
will include any reservation charge credits paid by Northern to other customers as a result of the construction of the 
Project. A reservation rate higher than Northern’s maximum tariff rate for firm service may be necessary to justify the 
Project economics. The term may be extended to cover construction costs. Alternatively, customers may pay Northern’s 
maximum tariff rates and provide a contribution in aid of construction for its proportionate share of the construction costs. 
In the case of a required reservation rate that is higher than the maximum tariff rate or a longer term is required, the 
customer will be informed in writing of such reservation rate and term. Within 10 calendar days upon receipt of the 
notification from Northern of a higher reservation rate or longer term, customer shall provide written notice to Northern 
whether it is terminating its participation in the Project or agreeing to proceed with the Project at the higher reservation

rate or longer term. If the customer fails to respond, the customer will be deemed to have terminated its participation.  
 
Customer must sign an agreement for construction of the necessary facilities for the Project within 30 calendar days after 
tender by Northern. The agreement will be designed for the service requested by each customer, and obligates the 
customer for its allocated share of capital costs. Northern and customers may agree to other terms specific to the facilities 
or service provided pursuant to this open season.
