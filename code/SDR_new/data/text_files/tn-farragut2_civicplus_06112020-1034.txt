REPORT TO THE BOARD OF MAYOR AND ALDERMEN  
PREPARED BY:   
Trevor Hobbs, Assistant to the Town Administrator; Bart Hose, Assistant Director  
 
 
 
of Community Development; Mark Shipley, Director of Community Development 
 
SUBJECT:    
Tavern Permit & Microbrewing 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION:  The purpose of this workshop item is to discuss amendments to the Tavern Permit, the 
concept of microbrewing, and to receive feedback from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen on issues related 
thereto.  
 
BACKGROUND:  The Town currently has a limit of four taverns, and they are required to sell food, having no 
more than 3,500 square feet of building/tenant space. An existing tavern, Admiral’s Pub, and a prospective 
tavern, Admiral’s Corner have or are in the process of requesting that the square footage restriction be 
increased. Additionally, Admiral’s Corner hopes to brew beer for both on-site sale and for distribution. Because 
these plans would require amendments to the Tavern and Zoning ordinance (in the case of microbrewing), staff 
seek the guidance and perspective of the Board on these issues.  
DISCUSSION: Staff would like feedback and guidance from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen on the 
following issues: 
 
A. The size of a tavern: (Should there be a restriction on size? What is the maximum square footage we are 
comfortable with?) 
B. Food sales: (How much food should a tavern sell? Should there be a percentage requirement?) 
C. Microbrewing/craft brewing: (Should the Town allow micro brewing/craft brewing? What scale of beer 
manufacturing is the Board comfortable with? Should there be a maximum on production?) 
D. Beer distribution: (Should a brewer be able to distribute? What level of distribution are we comfortable with? 
Should there be a requirement for percentage of in-house sales vs. distribution? 
E. Sales for off-premise consumption: (Should a tavern be able to sell beer for off-premise consumption (i.e. 
growlers/crowlers)? 
F. Location of taverns: (Other than in proximity to schools, daycares, and churches, where are we comfortable 
with taverns/brewpubs?) 
 
RECOMMENDATION: Staff plan to return with proposed amendments based on discussion and applications 
from specific businesses.

MEETING DATE
JUNE 11,2020
PREPARED BY: David Smoak, Town Administrator
SUBJECT: Ordinance2O-0T,onsecondreadingandpublichearing,toadopttheannual 
General Fund,State
Street Aid Fund, Capital lnvestment Fund, Equipment Replacement Fund, Tourism Fund and lnsurance Fund
budgets of the Town of Farragut, Tennessee for the fiscal year beginning July L, 2020 and ending June 30, 2021
INTRODUCTION: ThepurposeofthisagendaitemistoapproveOrdinance20-0T,onsecondreading,adopting
the annual budget for the fiscal year beginning July L, 2020 and ending June 30, 2021,.
BACKGROUND: The annual budget for the Town of Farragut must be approved prior to July L, which is the
start of the fiscal year for our community. The budget is also required to be balanced and remitted to the
State of Tennessee Comptroller for review once it has been approved by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen
(BMA). Planning for the upcoming tY202t budget started in January 2020, with departments turning in their
budget requests. The BMA had a strategic planning session in February and the Town had a workshop in early
March to review revenue and expenditures projections for next year. By the end of March, as the state of
Tennessee was under Safer at Home Orders from Governor Lee, the budget for FY20 and FY21 were both
reduced substantially due to the pending sales tax revenue shortfalls the Town would be incurring due to the
COVID-L9 pandemic.
D|SCUSSION: The proposed year end FY202O General Fund revenues are estimated at S11-,738,556, with
expenditures of $7,102,744. This year end estimate accounts for a9.6% reduction in sales tax revenue, as well
as additional revenue reductions to recreational fees, building permits and wholesale alcohol taxes. The
proposed tY2021, General Fund revenues were adjusted down from first reading to 5l-0,697,392. This is due to
the Town receiving revised State Shared Revenue projections that would decrease the Town's overall revenue
by S193,482. Sales tax revenue is estimated to be flat from FY20 at 55,926,734. This revenue source accounts
for 54.4% of the Town's total revenue, A second major revenue source is the Hall lncome Tax, which is
estimated at 5400,000. This is a very unpredictable revenue source as it relies on investment returns from
prior fiscal years and is set to decrease by 17% as the state phases out the tax in two years. A final revenue
sourcethat is being estimated conservatively is interest income. As interest rates have been reduced to zero
by the federal reserve, interest income is projected to be S104,800 at year end.
General Fund Expenditures for FY202I are proposed at 57,286,228, which is a2.6% increase over the FY2020
end of year estimate. Departments were asked to reduce their initial budget requests by over $300,000 ¡n
order to provide for employee staffing needs in Engineering, Public Works and the Community Center. The
facility operator position in the community center will only be filled once operations require it as the center is
now currently closed to the public, although we anticipate it opening again at some point in FY2021.. There
are no merit increases for personnel nor implementation of any recommendations from the classification and
compensation study included in the proposed budget. Employee health insurance costs are increasing by
$L08,000 from FY2020.
The overall General Fund budget projects Sg.4.f million in revenues over expenditures for tYZt. We will also
be funding our rainy-day fund at a total of $2.185 million and project an available fund balance at the end of
the FY21- budget year to be 517.55 million.
17
The Tourism Fund is a new special revenue fund for tY202L, as all revenues and expenditures will be
accounted for within the fund. A hotel/motel tax will be the primary source of revenue for this fund and
based on previous budget discussions with the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, the tax is not scheduled to be
implemented untilseptember 1,,2020. Estimated revenues are$226,000 and expenditures are 52L3,738.
The Capital lnvestment Program (ClP) Fund budget has a total of $L,L00,000 in new projects planned to get
underway in FY21. These projects include a pedestrian safety project on Watt Road at Mayor Bob Leonard
Park, construction of Smith Road sidewalkfrom Andover Boulevard to Everett Road and stormwater
improvements. Revenues for the CIP largely come from Town resources in the form of a S100,000 transfer
from the General Fund, 5707,020 from CIP reserves, and 5272,980 in FEMA reimbursement money from the
February 2019 storm event. Overall, the projected five-year available fund balance based on all the projects in
the current CIP is S1,4L5,399.
The State Street Aid Fund revenues for FY202l have been adjusted down from $855,000 to $ZqS,gOO due to
state shared revenues received being reduced from $37.61 per capita to S33.00. The estimated expenditures
of the State Street Aid Fund are $1,015,000. This fund is primarily used to resurface streets in the Town of
Farragut. At the end of the FY21 budget year there will be an estimated 51,052,831 in fund balance.
The ADA Capital Projects Fund does not have any major projects planned for FY2021.. Since developing the
Town's ADA Transition Plan in 2018, the Town has made improvements to Anchor Park and the restroom
facilities at Town Hall. When the street resurfacing projects are completed this year all curb ramps along the
frontage of the road will be brought up to ADA standards and those funds will be paid out of State Street Aid.
There is a proposed 550,000 transfer from the General Fund to the ADA Fund in tY2021,, with a projected fund
balance of S53,000.
The Equipment Replacement Fund will have projected expenditures of $208,240in FYZ1 and revenues of
57,500 in interest. This fund is used to purchase all vehicles and equipment throughout the Town's fleet. The
generalfund is transferring S157,500 to the equipment replacement fund this year. There will be an
estimated fund balance in the Equipment Replacement fund of S891-,353.
The lnsurance Fund has no estimated expenditures in FY2L and maintains a fund balance of S105,972. This
fund has been used to pay for retirement benefits for a closed retiree pension plan.
Although we are in the middle of a global health crisis the likes of which no one has seen in their lifetime, the
conservative budget principals the Town of Farragut has maintained will allow for us to make it through this
crisis with minimal impacts to our current service levels to the community.
Attached are the summary pages of each fund and Ordinance 20-07 for the Board's consideration

AGENDA NUMBER VI.B.1 
MEETING DATE 
June 11, 2020 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF MAYOR AND ALDERMEN 
PREPARED BY: 
Mark Shipley, Community Development Director 
SUBJECT: 
Ordinance 20-06, an ordinance on first reading to amend Appendix A – Zoning, Chapter 2. – 
Definitions, to define Art and Fitness Studio, and Chapter 3. – Specific District Regulations, 
Section XVII. – Office District (O-1), to modify permitted uses (Matthew McClanahan, 
Applicant) 
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:  This item involves a request to amend the permitted uses section 
of the Office Zoning District (O-1).  The original request by the applicant was very broad but, based on input 
received during Planning Commission discussions, was scaled back to ensure consistency with the general 
description and intent of the Office District.   
DISCUSSION:  The Office District provides for services primarily to residents of the Town with an emphasis 
on those uses that would appropriately transition to an abutting residential area by minimizing any adverse 
impacts.  Consequently, by applying this language to the applicant’s request and referring to some of the typical 
uses permitted in general office zoning districts in other communities, staff presented Ordinance 20-06 to the 
Planning Commission for their action on May 21.  As proposed, Ordinance 20-06 provided for the following 
uses to be added to the O-1 District since they would appear to be consistent with the general description and 
intent of the O-1 District: 
1. Barber Shop/Beautician/Hair Salon, and
2. Art and Fitness Studio, provided the building space and/or tenant space shall not exceed 1,500 gross
square feet
For clarity purposes, staff also proposed in Ordinance 20-06 to add a definition in Chapter 2 for an “Art and 
fitness studio.”  The definition proposed is very similar to the City of Knoxville’s and this is a permitted use in 
their general office zoning district.  In addition to the proposed new uses in O-1, staff recommended in 
Ordinance 20-06 that “Mortuary establishments” be removed as a permitted use in O-1.  These uses require a 
significant amount of parking and would appear to conflict with the intent of the O-1 District. 
RECOMMENDATION:  Included in your packet is Ordinance 20-06.  At their meeting on May 21, the 
Planning Commission unanimously recommended approval of Ordinance 20-06.  Community Development 
Director Mark Shipley also recommends approval of Ordinance 20-06 on first reading.  
PROPOSED MOTION:  To approve Ordinance 20-06 on first reading.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF MAYOR AND ALDERMEN 
PREPARED BY:  
Trevor Hobbs, Assistant to the Town Administrator; Bart Hose, Assistant Director 
of Community Development; Mark Shipley, Director of Community Development 
SUBJECT:  
Ordinance 20-09, on first reading, to amend Chapter 4, Alcoholic Beverages, by 
amending Section 4-150(4), Classes of Consumption Permits, Tavern Permit   
of the Farragut Municipal Code 
INTRODUCTION:  Admiral’s Pub, a current Tavern permit holder, has applied to amend the square footage 
restriction on taverns, from 3,500 square feet to 4,500 square feet.  
BACKGROUND: In response to social distancing and capacity restriction regulations related to COVID-19, 
the applicant seeks to expand their tavern by 1000 square feet, utilizing an available tenant space adjacent to 
The Admiral Pub. Accordingly, Ordinance 20-09 changes the square footage restriction from 3,500 square feet 
to 4,500 square feet for the tavern building/tenant space.  
DISCUSSION: The Town currently restricts taverns to no more than 3,500 square feet of building/tenant 
space. According to the applicant, limitations on capacity and seating due to COVID-19 health and safety 
regulations have necessitated expanding the tavern to include an adjacent tenant space of 1000 square feet, 
bringing the tavern’s gross square footage to 4,500 square feet. Expanding the tavern to include this additional 
space will allow for more total seating, despite the requirement to socially distance tables, and limit the number 
of patrons below the normal capacity per the fire code.  
The applicant hopes the expansion will allow for increased revenues, sufficient to remain in operation, despite 
social distancing and capacity restrictions.  
RECOMMENDATION BY: Trevor Hobbs, Assistant to the Town Administrator, for approval. 
PROPOSED MOTION:  Approval of Ordinance 20-09.

Ordinance Text Amendment
CHANGE REQUESTED *
Amend Zoning Ordinance, Sign Ordinance, or Municipal Code 
text as follows:
Modification of Article 3. Beer of the Farragut 
Municipal Code which currently limits the 
gross tenant space to 3500 sq ft for Taverns.
Proposed Amendment Necessity *
The proposed amendment is necessary due to the following 
changed or changing conditions: (be specific)
Due to pandemic and the need to social 
distance, an additional approx 1000 sq ft in 
the space next door will allow the spreading of 
tables and chairs and the possibility of enough 
revenue to survive.  As this new normal will 
last for the unforseeable future.  it is just 
fortunate that this space was already on my 
lease and is an easy extension with the 
addition of a doorway in the side wall.  It will 
be very difficult with a room my size to recoup 
the losses already taken and the losses that 
will occur in the present and near future.
