INTRODUCTION  
Section 1 
 
Recreation opportunities and public open spaces represent an important measure of 
community livability, help maintain neighborhood value, and promote a high quality of 
life.  Unlike communities that experience a trend of growth and expansion, the population 
base and municipal boundaries of Shorewood are effectively stable.  Due to the fully-built 
character of the community, acquisition of additional public acreage for park and 
recreation uses remains limited.  However, as land parcels within the Village undergo 
redevelopment or reclamation in the future, new opportunities to incorporate parks or 
public spaces will potentially arise.  
This plan, however, places an emphasis on enhancing and encouraging activation of 
existing public spaces that promotes greater outdoor public uses.  This plan is an update 
of the 2007 Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan, adjusting for improvements realized 
since its adoption.   
 
 
ATWATER PARK BLUFF 
PURPOSE OF THE PLAN  
This Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan represents an ofcial guide for park and 
recreation facility development for the Village. It considers both immediate needs and 
future concerns relevant to parks, trails, school grounds and open space areas. The plan 
strives to guide preservation and protection of natural and cultural resource features, and 
coordinate recreation facility improvements among various recreation management 
entities.   It serves as an implementation tool that will enable the realization of a high 
quality system of recreational spaces.   Each of the plan’s recommendations responds to 
existing conditions and identied recreational needs.  
Examination of existing acreage that accommodates active sports, such as baseball and 
soccer, was investigated during the original planning process and updated. The original 
plan identified underutilized open areas in parklands that were also considered for 
providing for additional eld space for active sports. The number and scale of 
baseball/softball and soccer elds were decient in accordance with needs in 2007. The 
Village was encouraged to continue collaborations with the Shorewood Kickers, Little 
League, School District and others regarding sports eld development and improvements.  
This plan represents an update of the 2007 plan.  Shorewood’s previous park plan dated 
back to 1992. According to guidelines outlined by the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
Resources (WDNR), park and recreation plans must be updated every ve years to retain 
eligibility for a variety of grant and funding opportunities at the state level.  
 
PLANNING PROCESS  
The 2007 plan involved a planning process designed to assist the Village in formulating 
long‐range improvements of public recreational space. The plan was developed through a 
collaborative effort by Village residents and stakeholders, the Village Park and 
Recreation Plan Steering Committee, and private consultants PDI. As part of that planning 
process, representatives from organizations and interested citizens were invited to 
participate.   
Updating the plan involved the Village, Parks Commission, and various stakeholders. 
Following approval of the updated Vision 2025 Plan early 2014, the Village embarked 
on creating a Strategic Management Plan and is in the process of formulating an 
Implementation Plan which will contribute to park improvement priorities in 2015.

COMMUNITY SETTING  
Location and Park History  
The Village of Shorewood is nestled between Lake Michigan on the east and the 
Milwaukee River on the west.  Bordered on the south and west by the City of Milwaukee 
and by the Village of Whitesh Bay on the north, it is a community of 13,162.  
Recognized as the “most densely populated municipality in Wisconsin,” the Village 
encompasses approximately 1.5 square miles (1,002 acres).  Originally part of the Town 
of Milwaukee, it seceded in 1900 to become East Milwaukee.  In 1917, the Village 
ofcially modied its name to Shorewood.  
Shorewood is characterized as a fully built or landlocked community, as vacant land is 
virtually absent.  By 1940, over one-half of existing residential structures were 
constructed, and by 1950, approximately 80 percent of land within the Village was 
developed. While the conguration of roads and residential neighborhoods reect logical 
and efcient design, the provision of adequate public open space and parks was largely 
overlooked by early Village founders.  
Hubbard Park skating pavilion, built 1936 
 
 
To the credit of the Village, Milwaukee County, and philanthropic and citizen support, a 
signicant percentage of public park and open space facilities in the community has been 
established through creative reclamation, conversion, and acquisition efforts. As a result, 
the Village and partnering interests have successfully assembled a park system that 
provides for a variety of active and passive recreational needs.

PREVIOUS PLANNING 
EFFORTS  
Section 2 
 
Since the adoption of the 2007 Park Plan, subsequent related plans were also adopted. 
This update incorporates recommendations from the 2009 River Riparian Plan and 2010 
Atwater Park Master Plan. Recommendations in these plans have not been fully 
implemented.  It remains likely that budgetary constraints, competition for capital 
improvement funds, and insufcient staff hours committed to park management have 
impeded intentions to enhance park facilities. Since the 2007 plan adoption, a Parks 
Commission was formed to assist in prioritizing and implementing recommendations. 
 
 
RIVER PARK 
CENTRAL DISTRICT MASTER PLAN (2006)  
The Central District Master Plan (CDMP) provided a vision for how Shorewood’s central 
business district could grow and change in the future.  It set a new direction for the District 
with residential, commercial, and mixed-use opportunities as well as enhanced parking 
and open space. Parks included in the planning area include River, Hubbard, and the 
Atwater School Grounds. The Village updated that plan in 2015. 
River Park  
The 2006 CDMP proposed a redevelopment on the site of the parking lots along Oakland 
Avenue. A new green space should mirror the existing space (Humble Park) on the east 
side of the street is proposed at the terminus of Edgewood, and would thereby create a 
new entrance experience into River Park. The 2015 CDMP removed River Park as a 
potential redevelopment opportunity, but supports a comprehensive design for any future 
park improvements.  
Hubbard Park  
While Hubbard Park is not specically mentioned for improvements, the plan proposes 
mixed-use developments to the north of the park adjacent to the Oak Leaf Trail and south 
of Capitol Drive within the B-4 River District.  An assisted living and memory development 
is scheduled for completion late 2015.  
Atwater School Grounds  
The plan proposed major modications to the front of the Atwater School grounds. The 
parking lot would be modied and expanded to the north to add spaces. The front 
grounds would be recongured to create a District Gardens theme along the Capitol 
Drive frontage including a drop-off lane and potential water feature.   The streetscaping 
completed in 2010 in this section of Capitol Drive, included raised landscaped beds and 
biofiltered recessed vegetation beds, to enhance the Garden District theme.   
 
VISIONING 2025  
The purpose of the plan was to create a community-wide overall vision for Shorewood 
and was updated in 2014 with input from focus groups and at public workshops.  Input 
was focused on what the community valued about living in Shorewood, what the concerns 
are regarding current issues in the community, and how a successful future of the Village 
could be envisioned.  
Results. The plan’s ndings/recommendations dealt with many overall issues confronting 
the community, and parks were referenced in a general sense.

RIVER DISTRICT RIPARIAN RESTORATION & TRAIL 
PLAN (2009)  
A Riparian Plan was adopted in 2009 that addresses restoration of the bluff along the 
Milwaukee River extending from Hubbard Park to East Capitol Drive. The plan also 
develops a trail system.   Three parcels along the river in the B-4 River District are 
privately owned.  Two of the parcels were combined for a senior assisted living 
development that will be completed by late 2015.  The bluff along those two parcels was 
dedicated to the Village.  The Village supports redevelopment of the third parcel with a 
goal that the bluff would be conveyed to the Village and the riparian plan could be fully 
implemented.   
ATWATER PARK MASTER PLAN (2010) 
The Atwater Park Master Plan presented site improvement alternatives for the upper 
terrace, bluff and beach.  The plan recommended greater amenities to accommodate a 
diverse group of users, focusing on accessibility and recreation.

DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS  
Section 3 
An understanding of growth and composition of the local population provides an 
important foundation for the Village of Shorewood Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation 
Plan. The demand for recreational opportunities and facilities is inuenced, in part, by 
demographic characteristics. This section evaluates historic trends in population, and 
analyzes characteristics of the residents within the Village.  
 
POPULATION FORECASTS  
The population served by the parks and open space facilities in the Village of Shorewood 
is approximately 13,162 (as of the US Census, 2010). This gure represents a population 
decline of 4% since 2000.  
However, given new housing development since the last Census and planned development 
in the Village, the population is anticipated to increase.  Over the next ten years, it is 
estimated that the population will increase by approximately 500 persons.  The Wisconsin 
Department of Administration recently forecasted a decrease in population in 2015 and 
then small increases the following 10 years.

POPULATION BY AGE  
The age distribution of a community is perhaps the most referenced population 
characteristic relevant to future park and recreational demand and needs.  
The population of the Village decreased by approximately 600 persons between 2000 
and 2010.  While population decreased, some age groups increased. The largest 
increases were seen in the 20-29 and 60-69 age groups. The largest decreases were 
seen in the 40-49 and 70-79 age groups.  The following graph shows the change in age 
structure for Shorewood and Milwaukee County.

HOUSING  
The total number of occupied housing units within the Village (2010) was 6,539. Although 
Shorewood is considered a fully-built community, it remains likely that the Village will 
continue to experience an increase in housing units within the rental market.  The diversity 
of housing in the Village of Shorewood is characterized by a high concentration of renter-
occupied housing (53.4%) in 2010.  This trend is largely due to the Village’s proximity to 
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Downtown Milwaukee and availability of 
rental housing for young urban professionals. There is a growing demand for multifamily 
housing versus purchasing a single-family home for some population sectors.

IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION TRENDS  
 
The Village of Shorewood witnessed a slight but steady decrease in 
population between 1980 and 2010. Based on market trends, the Village 
anticipates an increase of 500 persons to the population base between 2010 
and 2020. Therefore, use and demand of public recreational spaces will 
likely increase.  
 
 
The American Community Survey estimates that nearly two-thirds of 
Shorewood residents have moved in during the last decade.  Although 
Shorewood’s population continues to decrease slowly, the Village is attracting 
and losing specific demographic groups. 
 
 
The 59.4% increase in residents aged 20-24 is significant, as is the 74% jump 
in residents aged 60 to 64 (American Community Survey 2007-2011). The 
growth in baby boomers is a national trend, but Shorewood is 
keeping/capturing more than all comparable communities except for 
Whitefish Bay (75.5%) 
 
 
Between 2000 and 2010, the Village witnessed a decrease (-21.5%) in 
persons under 9 years, a decrease (-36%) in the population of persons 20 to 
39 years of age, and an increase (+49%) in the population of persons 40 to 
59 years of age. This data suggests a growing need for recreation facilities 
which serve the Village’s aging population. As the current less than 9 years 
age group shifts to the 10 to 19 years age group during the next decade, 
the population representing youth and young adults (0 to 19 years) may 
experience an overall decline. Therefore, facilities and recreational pursuits 
which cater to an older mature population, and those which encourage 
walking and cycling, such as trails and circuit paths should be considered in 
the development of park enhancements.  
 
 
New housing construction will likely continue to occur in tandem with inll and 
redevelopment projects, and will probably focus on high-density multifamily 
dwelling units. Therefore, publicly-accessible spaces, plazas and trail 
connections should be required in development submissions for properties that 
are undergoing redevelopment.  
  
 
 
REGIONAL RECREATION TRENDS AND 
OBSERVATIONS  
A review of the Wisconsin Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan 2011-2016 
indicates similar ndings with national trends related to nature-based outdoor recreation 
activity. According to the 2005-2009 National Survey on Recreation and the Environment, 
the biggest change in Wisconsin has been the migration of rural populations to urban 
centers, which is reflected in increased demand for urban-based recreational activities. 
The top growth in Wisconsin recreation activities by percent is in outdoor handball or 
racquetball, soccer, kayaking and surfing. 
The following table was taken from the Wisconsin Outdoor Recreation Plan, projecting 
recreation trends that considered the percentage changes in recreation participants, as 
well as industry forecasts and opinions from recreation professionals, to suggest which 
activities will be popular in the future. These observations are made for a five year 
period, and therefore reflect the most pressing demands on recreation in the immediate 
future.

Recreation associations in Shorewood, such as the Shorewood Kickers, Shorewood Boys 
Youth Lacrosse Club and the Shorewood Little League (baseball), demonstrate increasing 
local interest in active team sports as evidenced by rising rates of participation. 
Additionally, involvement in team sports spans a range of ages, and therefore requires 
appropriately-scaled elds and facilities to accommodate differing skill levels.

EXISTING PARKS, 
RECREATION FACILITIES & 
SCHOOL GROUNDS  
Section 4 
This section presents an overview of the existing parks, recreation facilities, and school 
grounds within the Village of Shorewood. This comprehensive inventory serves as basis for 
analysis and recommendations contained in this plan.  
 
EXISTING PARK, RECREATION FACILITIES AND 
SCHOOL GROUNDS  
There are approximately 136 acres of public outdoor recreation space within the Village 
of Shorewood. The Village, Shorewood School District and Milwaukee County own and 
manage publicly-accessible recreation acreage in the community.    Partnerships between 
the Village and other recreation management authorities represent a crucial element 
regarding future use, development and maintenance of various public recreation sites.

Village of Shorewood Park Facilities  
Although Village parks represent only 24% of total outdoor public space, they are 
traditionally considered the mainstay of recreational venues in Shorewood.   Maintenance 
and improvements to parks are undertaken by the Department of Public Works. The 
municipal budget includes annual funding for park maintenance and improvements via the 
Capital Improvement Fund.  
School District of Shorewood Facilities  
The School District of Shorewood, which holds seven percent of outdoor public space, 
affords opportunities for the community to utilize elementary school grounds and 
recreational facilities during after-school hours, weekends and during the summer. Two 
elementary school campuses, the intermediate school and high school are used by the 
general public, the School District of Shorewood Recreation and Community Services 
Department, and local youth sports organizations.  
Facilities that are common to elementary schools include playgrounds, soccer elds, 
baseball and softball diamonds, paved play areas, and tennis courts. Although the Village 
does not manage the school grounds, residents may utilize outdoor facilities for recreation 
when not being utilized by the schools.  
Milwaukee County Park and Trail Facilities  
Milwaukee County maintains jurisdiction over 93 (68%) acres of public parks and natural 
areas in the Village of Shorewood, and over 15,000 acres in Milwaukee County. Within 
Shorewood, the County has authority over, and manages enhancements and maintenance 
of Estabrook Park and a 1.6-mile off-road section of the regional Oak Leaf Trail that 
traverses the former railroad grade.

PARK AND RECREATION STANDARDS  
The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) have traditionally recommended 
standards to assess demand for park land in urban areas. Historically, NRPA standards 
recommended a range of 6 to 10.5 acres of developed park land per every 1000 
residents. An analysis of park, open space and school ground acreage reveals that the 
recreational space within the Village equates to approximately 9.3 acres per 1000 
population. The overwhelming majority of acreage occurs within one park facility 
(Estabrook County Park).  
As previously stated, NRPA standards traditionally served as a benchmark to analyze the 
deciencies of a local park system. Yet a more realistic measure of park quality considers 
the individual character of site, location, access, maintenance levels, diversity of offerings, 
and the range of amenities. These characteristics inuence the intensity of recreational use 
to a greater degree than the amount of available acreage.  
 
OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL AMENITY & RESOURCE 
INVENTORY  
To validate future recreational needs and amenities, inventory of the existing facility base 
was completed in 2007 and updated. This analysis examines park, open space, trail and 
school grounds. The following table lists primary recreational uses within specic sites:

Recreational facilities maintained by the Village represent a fraction of total facilities 
available to Shorewood residents. The majority of land-consumptive recreational uses, 
such as baseball, softball, soccer and tennis are accommodated within School District and

County facilities. This fact demands that the Village approach its park and recreation 
planning in a collaborative and cooperative manner, and consider various options to assist 
in shared funding and management of extraterritorial recreation venues.

SUMMARY  
In recent years, the level of service offered by park and school grounds in Shorewood has 
experienced a modest gain.  However, it must be recognized that recreational 
opportunities in the Village depend heavily on upgrades and offerings made possible by 
the School District and County. While a cursory analysis of parkland acreage indicates 
that the Village is compliant with traditional standards outlined by the NRPA, it should be 
acknowledged that (1) school grounds are not available for use during school-hours and 
during programmed events and (2) that the County must permit regional use of facilities 
for soccer, baseball and softball. Rising recreation demands will continue to rely on these 
non-municipal providers for recreational space.  
On average, the conditions of park and recreation amenities are “fair”. Amenities that 
receive a “poor” rating should be prioritized for short-term improvements and upgrades.

GENERAL ISSUES, GOALS & 
OBJECTIVES  
Section 5 
GENERAL ISSUES  
There was extensive community outreach during the original plan creation in 2007 which 
also involved a steering committee. Following approval of the updated Vision 2025 Plan 
early 2014, the Village embarked on creating a Strategic Management Plan and is in the 
process of formulating an Implementation Plan which will contribute to park improvement 
priorities in 2015. The following issues and themes relevant to park, trail and school 
ground facilities emerged from when the plan was originally adopted and from recent 
input. 
 
 
 
HUMBLE PARK 
Additional Parkland  
As a fully-built community, an increase in the quantity of parkland or public recreational 
acreage will generally be limited to areas that undergo redevelopment. Therefore, 
augmenting existing quantity of parkland acreage will require creative strategies 
endorsed by the Village. Opportunities to acquire path, trail or shoreland easements in 
conjunction with private redevelopment should be prioritized as a requirement by the 
Village in development submissions, if applicable. Public plazas and outdoor gathering 
spaces should also be promoted within redeveloping areas of the Business District, as well. 
Since 2007, a section of the bluff along the Milwaukee River directly south of Capitol 
Drive was conveyed to the Village.  The Village’s Shoreland Ordinance prevents any 
construction on the Milwaukee River bluff. A River Riparian Plan was adopted in 2009 
and in 2010 the Village adopted a resolution expressing support for the Milwaukee River 
Greenway Master Plan. In 2014 the Village was awarded the Knowles-Stewardship grant 
for bluff restoration and trail improvements. 
Park and School Ground Funding and Maintenance  
Budgets for park and school ground development must competitively vie with other capital 
improvement projects at the municipal, school district and county levels. While funding of 
park and school grounds maintenance occurs on an annual basis, the majority of efforts 
focus on retaining the existing level of service and quality.  In some parks, park amenities 
have outlived their functional use, and are in need of replacement.  In 2012 the Village 
created a Parks Donation Program, identifying various park amenities in need of 
replacement or new amenities. 
Trail Connectivity and Design  
 
Shorewood residents are fortunate to have access to regional trail systems that traverse 
the western portion of the Village. The Milwaukee County Oak Leaf Trail and the 
Milwaukee River Greenway afford recreation opportunities for commuters and 
recreationists. While the segment of the County’s Oak Leaf Trail within the Village is fully 
developed, the Trail -- which follows a former rail corridor -- terminates its off-road 
segment north of the Village.  Milwaukee County created a four-year implementation plan 
to extend the off-road trail northward by acquiring the remaining public right-of-way by 
the railroad. Additionally, the Milwaukee River Greenway -- a nature path which 
navigates the River’s shoreland zone -- provides a pedestrian connection between 
Glendale and the Cambridge Woods neighborhood (Milwaukee). Connectivity and 
continued formalization of these “through routes” remains an important local and regional 
issue to consider.  New sections of the Oak Leaf Trail have been implemented between 
Shorewood and Brown Deer; however, the Oak Leaf Trail still terminates at the northern 
end of Estabrook Park. Construction began May 2015 to extend the trail, removing old 
rail beds. 
 
Most park spaces include internal path systems that direct users to amenities.  In some 
cases, the design or conguration of the paths do not provide a circuit or “loop,” which 
limits access and potential to fully explore a park site.  
Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan 
 
 
 
37 | P a g e  
 
A common concern is the lack of connectivity between the Milwaukee County Oak Leaf 
Trail and both (1) residential districts and (2) public park spaces. Recent improvements 
include an enhanced entry into the Milwaukee County Estabrook Park from Shorewood’s 
Wilson Drive and Kensington Boulevard intersection, clearing away brush and adding a 
chipped path.  The construction of the new Oak Leaf Trail Bridge over Capitol Drive in 
2010 also added new connections onto Capitol Drive. A new entrance on Oak Leaf Trail 
was added into Hubbard Park upon opening of a beer garden. The entrance onto the 
same bike trail at River Park in the 3500 block of Oakland Avenue removed a dual 
entrance and widened and landscaped the remaining entrance.   
Active Team Sports Fields  
 
Active sports elds that include soccer, football, baseball, and softball, are located in 
several parks and school grounds.  Participants and sponsors of active sports indicated the 
current number and sizes of elds are insufcient to meet existing and growing interest in 
activities such as little league baseball, softball and soccer. While soccer activities may 
occur within the outelds of baseball diamonds during the fall season, they must forfeit use 
of ball elds during the spring season when baseball activities commence. This limitation 
places hardships on soccer uses.  
 
Additionally, the inadequate quality of the eld turf and moderate level of maintenance 
of Estabrook Park fields is of concern.  In 2011 Lake Bluff Elementary fields were redone, 
eliminating flooding that often occurred on one of the ball fields. 
Design Quality  
 
The design of park spaces does not consistently incorporate high quality materials or 
construction.  Overall, there appears to be variance in the quality and condition of park 
furnishings, such as lighting, benches, trash receptacles and signage.  Moreover, there is a 
general absence of noteworthy built features or seasonal ora within park spaces.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shoreline Access  
 
Water bodies and riparian corridors that abut park spaces in the Village represent a 
valued resource. While the water’s edge is generally reachable by means of paths or 
trails, there is a need to improve access through trail development, waynding signage, 
and path amenities.  
 
Natural Resource Restoration and Protection  
 
The majority of park and open space facilities within the Village are characterized by 
natural resource components, such as riverine and beach environments, woodlands, 
wetlands, and bluff features.  Major portions of Hubbard Park, Estabrook Park, Atwater 
Park and the Nature Preserve are designated as Primary Environmental Corridors by the 
Southeast Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC), and are further regulated 
by State and Federal environmental mandates. Additionally, parklands that abut the 
Milwaukee River are afforded an extra measure of protection and regulation through the 
Village Shoreland Ordinance (Ordinance No. 1917, October 2006). Therefore, protection 
and restoration of ecological integrity should remain an important objective of future 
parkland management.  
 
Special Use Facilities  
A “wish list” of special-use facilities was developed throughout the original planning 
process, and included a skate park, beach house, baseball/softball elds, soccer elds, a 
batting cage, and boating facilities. Future implementation of a portion of these facilities 
will rely on partnerships between the Village, Milwaukee County, special interest and not-
for-prot organizations.

EVALUATION & 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
  
Section 6 
The evaluation of park and recreational facilities considers a number of factors, such as 
use levels, facility quality, presence or absence of user amenities, recreational trends, and 
human observation. Instead of utilizing a traditional “demand and needs” quantication to 
evaluate park facilities, this evaluation represents a qualitative appraisal that is more 
suited to the conditions and constraints inherent to Shorewood.  
Recommendations for park enhancements follow the descriptive evaluation of park sites.  
Individual recommendations are illustrated on accompanying concept plans found at the 
end of this section.  
 
ATWATER PARK EVALUATION  
UPPER TERRACE STRENGTHS  
Flexibility of the space. In general, the upper terrace is simplistic and informal in its 
design layout. The terrace affords opportunities for self-actualized forms of recreation, 
such as picnicking, scenic viewing, and walking. The only programmed space is found in 
the northern area of the park (children’s playground).  
Public Art. In 2010 a sculpture by international artist Juame Plensa was donated and 
placed in Atwater Park.  The 2010 Atwater Park Master Plan designated a contemplative 
area in the southern section of the upper park terrace area.  
High visibility and accessibility. The upper terrace represents the smallest section of the 
park (approximately the same surface area as a football eld), but supports the greatest 
concentration of activity and use. The average depth of the terrace (street-to-bluff) is 110 
feet, and therefore allows for good visual access throughout the ground plane. The park is 
sited along one of the most heavily traveled street corridors in the Village, and is viewed 
by numerous passers-by daily (10,600 vehicles per day, annual average daily trafc, 
2013).  
Unobstructed views to the lake. The primary attraction of the upper terrace is the view 
to the lake and shoreline. Atwater Park is the only public space within the Village that 
affords unobstructed visual access to these natural resources (the Nature Preseve provides 
for access, but the views are limited from the upper elevations).  
Playground Area. The upper playground will be replaced in 2015 with a portion ADA 
accessible. It is sited in an appropriate location, at the northern end of the park and is a 
short and convenient distance from the street. As the only programmed space within the 
upper terrace, the location allows for active play without disrupting more tranquil areas 
of the park that are utilized for passive uses, such as viewing scenery and sitting.  
Seating wall. With the restoration of the bluff and upper path in 2011, a seating wall of 
large limestone blocks runs adjacent to the southern upper path, allowing for leisure 
activity and enjoying the views of the lake.  
Gate. A decorative iron gate feature was added at the top of the bluff path, connected 
to the bunker building.  The gate was put in place in 2012 to deter access to the beach 
after the park is closed. 
 
 
ATWATER PARK

47 | P a g e  
 
UPPER TERRACE WEAKNESSES  
Existing “centerpiece” of the park. The overlook platform (veteran’s memorial), agpole, 
paved plaza and walkways that lead to these elements comprise the primary built 
features of the upper terrace. These centrally-located built features direct park users to 
the stairway.  
This feature affords spectacular panoramic views of the Lake Michigan environs design 
perspective.  However, this central element is understated and does not serve as a 
“signature” or compelling feature of the park. The configuration also obstructs set up, 
views and use of the upper terrace lawn area for large community events. 
Absence of high quality landscape design. Design details of the park do not reect high 
quality materials and craftsmanship observed in neighboring private residences. While it 
is appropriate that the park remains fairly simple in its design, there is an absence of built 
features, such as entry monuments that could enhance the function and aesthetic qualities 
of the park.  
Additionally, the upper terrace suffers from a dearth of low plantings that include shrubs 
(masses), perennial or ornamental grass plantings that would assist to dene the limits of 
the space. In particular, there are few foreground plantings along the street-sidewalk and 
bluff edge that would contribute to visual interest and diversication of the ground plane.  
Outmoded furnishings. The existing bench seats exhibit signs of wear and are of low-
quality design; however, two benches were recently donated.  There are three different 
styles of benches present. 
Exposure to natural elements. While the upper terrace supports a mixture of small 
ornamental and shade tree species (approximately 2 dozen), the majority of tree 
specimens are of young age and do not provide protection from the sun. An established 
overhead tree canopy will eventually evolve, but this will require 20-30 years of growth.  
Moreover, there are no built shade structures that provide protection from natural 
elements, most notably near the playground. 
 
ATWATER PARK 
Absence of technical amenities. Shorewood’s annual Chicken Roast and Fourth of July 
events are held on the terrace; however, there is not an electrical supply to accommodate 
entertainment venues.  The existing irrigation system also prohibits staking tents for events.  
 
BLUFF STRENGTHS  
Choice of access (stairs or path). Access to the lower beach area is accommodated 
through two access routes – a direct stairway and a circuitous (switchback) path.  Park 
users may choose which route to utilize, and may select a combination of routes that 
incorporates both path and stairs.  
Path grade. The path grade affords an alternative route that is less strenuous than the 
stairs, and is especially appropriate for physically-challenged persons and children.  Due 
to the steepness of the stair route, the pathway represents a preferred course to access 
the beach. The path also allows for maintenance vehicles to access the lower areas of the 
park.  
In 2011 the upper portion of the bluff path was replaced due to erosion caused by 
stormwater runoff.  The new path section is ADA compliant, but the remaining lower 
portion is not. 
Native plant restoration. A plan created in the late 1990s which outlines vegetation 
restoration strategies had been partially implemented up to 2006. Following bluff 
restoration work in 2011, a five-year plant restoration plan was developed and is being 
implemented. Revegetation efforts are succeeding and the bluff landscape is ecologically 
meaningful.  
 
BLUFF WEAKNESSES  
Stair feature. The stairway represents the central element within the bluff environment. It is 
characterized by a very steep tread, and is strictly utilitarian in its design. The condition of 
the stair treads is fair. It is likely that many able-bodied beach-goers utilize a combination 
of paths that includes (1) the asphalt pathway to the intersection of the stairs at mid-bluff, 
then (2) the stairs to the activity zone of the beach.  If this method of obtaining access to 
the lower areas of the park is veried, then the upper portion of the stair feature becomes 
of less importance to the circulation system.   
Pathway experience. The asphalt pathway (switchback) represents a highly-functional 
element of the park, but does not provide for interesting “episodes” along its length. 
While continual views of the lake and lower beach are afforded throughout the duration 
of the path, there are no opportunities to sit along the pathway to rest or view the lake 
environment. The entire stretch of trail is exposed to sun and natural elements and lower 
sections of the path pavement exhibits cracking due to soil creep.  
Blufand restoration. While revegetation efforts have been and continue to be 
implemented, there are portions of the bluff that are characterized by non-desired and 
Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan 
 
 
 
49 | P a g e  
 
non-native plant species.   In addition to low ecological value, these areas do not 
contribute in a positive manner to visual aesthetics.    
A visually-delineated property boundary. The park boundaries that abut neighboring 
private residences are marked by the absence of a tree canopy, as the former tree 
species were clear-cut to the park border. This severe visual delineation does not imply 
“natural,” and appears to contradict intense efforts to establish a native plant palette 
within the bluff environment.  
 
BEACH STRENGTHS  
An accessible beach. The beach environment is relatively level, and is approximately 2 
acres in size and nearly 900 feet in length.  During the summer season, the sand surface is 
graded weekly, and a sporadic measure of success has been achieved in reducing the 
effects of decomposing cladophera and bacteria associated with stormwater runoff.  
Seclusion. The steep backdrop of the bluff provides a sense of remoteness for beach 
users, and affords a somewhat natural experience within the connes of the most densely-
developed municipality in the State of Wisconsin.  
Playground and boardwalk. As identified in the 2010 Atwater Park Master Plan, a 
boardwalk was built in 2010 from the base of the stairs extending north for 160 feet.  A 
new playground was installed in 2012 off the northern edge of the boardwalk, providing 
new and creative ways for children to recreate at the beach.  A shade structure was 
added on the boardwalk in 2014. 
BEACH WEAKNESSES  
Absence of shade and user amenities. Except for the one umbrella shade structure 
added in 2014, the beach area is without permanent or semi-permanent (dismountable) 
structures that would otherwise provide “creature comforts” or “drawing cards” for park 
users. In particular, there are no shade structures or facilities that afford a retreat from 
exposure to the sun.  
 
ATWATER PARK 
The addition of the playground provides recreation for children but there are no other 
formal recreational amenities provided for other users, such as permanent volleyball nets 
and concrete table tennis platforms. 
Location of path (asphalt) terminus. The grade of the asphalt pathway that provides 
access to the beach (maintenance vehicles and pedestrians) leads to the south end of the 
beach in a zone that is not highly active by visitors.  It is likely that many beach users 
traverse the bluff via the pathway to the point where it intersects with the stairs, and then 
continue down the staircase.  However, this does not provide a feasible option for small 
children, parents with strollers, or physically challenged persons.  
Pier deterioration. The three breakwater structures or piers that extend from the beach 
into Lake Michigan are constructed of stacked concrete masonry units, and exhibit signs of 
corrosion. While these features were constructed for the purpose of protecting the beach 
and shoreline from erosion, they are now visually unappealing and detract from the 
physical environment of the beach. The public is prohibited from accessing these structures. 
Water and Beach Quality. Use of the beach during the warm season is sometimes 
hindered due to poor water quality, and the presence and odors from decaying algae. 
While stormwater overow within the Village occurs, other factors such as invasive mussel 
species contribute to detrimental qualities of the beach.  
Adverse impacts generated by poor water and beach quality not only discourage use of 
the shoreland, but also negatively inuence air quality within the park’s upper terrace and 
bluff environment.  In 2010 an Ecological Study was completed for Atwater Park and 
water quality testing is completed routinely throughout the summer months.

ATWATER PARK RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
UPPER TERRACE  
1) 
Remove the inner pathways that lead to the overlook feature to open up 
the park. 
 
2) 
Expand the existing overlook feature that builds upon the current viewshed, 
and establishes a more prominent signature element within the upper terrace.  
The design should employ curvilinear forms that are represented by the 
pathway system, provide for seating along portions of the overlook, and 
utilize high quality railing elements. An elegant stairway feature should flank 
the walls of the overlook, and direct pedestrians to the lower pathway. 
 
3) 
Construct entry gateway features (4) adjacent to the north and south 
pathways that formalize entry into the park environment. The design of the 
monuments should incorporate natural materials and should be contextually-fit 
with the neighborhood residences. The southern monument must fit with the 
existing sculpture. 
 
4) 
Create contemplative area at the south end of the park, moving the Graves 
Memorial Rose Garden and Veterans Memorial there in combination with a 
garden and existing Plensa sculpture.  
 
5) 
Redesign seating nodes (2) that employ high quality pavement and plant 
materials and provide for visual interest. Bench and trash receptacle 
furnishings should be strategically sited within the nodes. 
 
6) 
Construct permanent shade/arbor structures (2) at seating nodes located at 
the northernmost and southernmost areas of the upper terrace. The shade 
structures should employ high quality materials and design details that are of 
enduring value and minimize obstructing views of the lake. 
 
7) 
Replace benches (14) with more comfortable and durable prototypes. 
Benches and trash receptacles should be affixed to concrete pads that afford 
greater durability.  
 
8) 
Install shrub and perennial plantings along the periphery of the lawn area.  
Plantings would continue to provide unobstructed views into the upper terrace, 
yet assist to dene the space through limited natural means.

BLUFF  
9) 
Construct viewing/seating deck overlooks (2) along the outer edge of the 
pathway.  Decks would afford opportunities to rest, and provide opportunities 
for interpretive signage and views along the pathway.  Consideration should 
be given to utilizing temporary (seasonal) canopies that offer shade during 
summer months of use. Interpretive signage should also be incorporated along 
the pathway to communicate the social and natural history of the site.  
 
10) 
Continue to restore and maintain native vegetation on the bluff and 
aggressively manage invasive species.  Ensure that fruit-bearing shrubs which 
enhance foraging habitat for migratory birds are included as a component of 
the plant palette.  
 
BEACH  
11) 
Complete construction of a boardwalk south of the bluff stairs, between 
the asphalt pathway and the beach that directs pedestrian trafc to a more 
active area. A section of the boardwalk was completed in 2011, connecting 
from the bluff stairs northward. The remaining boardwalk should diverge from 
the southern path terminus to the base of the stairway.

12) 
Install seasonal tensile shade structures for the beach and on new deck 
platforms to encourage use.  Canvas canopies supported by metal pole 
structures would be appropriate, especially if this sheltering theme is 
repeated along the path.   
 
13) 
Complete installation of (2) seasonal above-grade deck platforms along 
the toe of the bluff south of the bluff stairs and near shade structures to 
provide a hard-surface for seating or beach equipment storage.   
 
14) 
Relocate the sand volleyball facility to the north, thereby helping to cluster 
recreational uses near the base of the existing stairway.  
 
15) 
Supply seasonal portable toilets with a privacy screen. 
 
16) 
Investigate the impact that a reconstruction of the breakwater/pier 
structure would have on improving the beach’s quality and accessibility for 
park users. Depending on the outcome of that investigation and the 
availability of needed funding, consider the reconstruction of the 
breakwater/pier structure or partial renovation of initial section for seating 
and viewing the lake. 
 
17) 
Construct a new pavilion, providing a cafe/concession and overlook, 
restrooms, a multipurpose room, and equipment storage, located 
approximately where the old beach house was. 
 
 
 
ATWATER PARK 
HUBBARD PARK EVALUATION  
DEVELOPED AREA STRENGTHS  
Non-programmed nature of the space and solitude. The simplicity of Hubbard Park 
provides a refuge from urban environments, and represents a hallmark of this space.  
Unobstructed views and access to the river’s edge. The views to the Milwaukee River 
corridor from the lower and upper terraces of the park, accompanied by the natural 
setting of the site, are perhaps the most valued characteristic of the park. Access to the 
water’s edge in the vicinity of the lower terrace and along the nature path allow park 
users to experience the water resource in an informal fashion.  
Cluster of historic built features. The grouping of four historic structures and cultural 
landscape features that embody railroad development and Works Progress 
Administration efforts from the 1930s represent important components of the built park 
environment that possess greater potential for interpretation and public uses.  
Maintain summer concert series at lower level of the park. 
Continue support of Hubbard Park Lodge and River Club as a private restaurant and 
outdoor space as a Beer Garden. 
 
DEVELOPED AREA WEAKNESSES  
Pedestrian access from adjacent parks and trails. Although Hubbard Park may be 
accessed via tunnel systems (pedestrian and vehicles) that connect to the adjacent 
neighborhood, there is no direct access between Hubbard Park and the adjacent Oak 
Leaf Trail or River Park with one exception.  In 2014 a Beer Garden was opened 
between the Hubbard Lodge and the River Club.  During hours of operation, a gate is 
open from the Oak Leaf Trail.  There is also no formal pedestrian access from River Park 
to the two tunnel entrances. 
Inability to “waynd”. The linear conguration of park acreage, limited means of 
accessing the site, and arrangement of paths and buildings is somewhat unordered, and 
may generate confusion for persons that visit the park.  In particular, the pathway 
conguration within the lower terrace terminates at the boat (storage) house, and the 
nature trail that extends northward along the river’s edge often goes unnoticed.  
Dearth of bench seating in lower levels.  Even though the most commanding views of the 
River occur from the upper area of the park, the lower terrace provides for a distinctive 
feeling of enclosure and offers a private experience near the water’s edge.  However, 
bench seating is limited in this portion of the park.  
Pronounced isolation from public and infrequent utilization of the park may deter 
certain users who perceive the park as unsafe. 
Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan 
 
 
 
55 | P a g e  
 
Prohibition of meandering between Beer Garden and other areas of the park with 
beverages.  The recently added Beer Garden has been successful but due to how the 
park is oriented, adults may not leave the upper area with an alcoholic beverage to 
accompany children who want to explore the river’s edge. 
Lack of bicycle parking in lower level of park. There are no bicycle racks located in the 
lower level of the park or the parking lot. Bicycle racks were added in the upper level as 
part of the Beer Garden in 2014. 
 
NATURAL AREA STRENGTHS  
Integrity of ecological components. The presence of mature stands of black oaks, “high 
order” ground-level vegetation and limited invasion from non-native plant species 
represents a stable and very uncommon natural environment within the urbanized area of 
Milwaukee.  
Ability to traverse the river’s edge. Within the Village of Shorewood, Hubbard Park 
affords easy access to the Milwaukee River.  The nature trail along the River that extends 
northward to Estabrook Park is also an appreciated resource.  
 
NATURAL AREA WEAKNESSES  
Visual presence of the nature trail. The nature trail, while informal, is only discovered by 
happenchance. There is no signage or logical connections that enable for ease of 
waynding.  
Unrecognized natural merits. Hubbard Park supports high-order ora, but is not 
promoted as a special feature of the park.  
Degradation of Milwaukee River Bluff. The numerous informal paths which have 
developed on the bluff are contributing to the bluff’s degraded condition including soil 
compaction and erosion.  
 
 
HUBBARD PARK 
HUBBARD PARK RECOMMENDATIONS  
Developed Area  
1) 
Work with Milwaukee County Parks to construct a path between the Oak 
Leaf Trail and the Lower Terrace that mirrors the primary entrance to River 
Park on the east side of the trail. At present, a mountain bike spur is found in 
this location. The trail into Hubbard Park should closely follow the existing 
path that runs alongside the northeast face of the Youth Pavilion. Trail 
development will require the following treatment measures:  
 
Embankment stabilization  
 
Signage and barriers that discourage social trail development within 
the upland environment of the bluff (boulders/ natural fencing)  
 
Path stabilization and surface hardening (porous pavement)  
 
Signage/entry monument at intersection with the Oak Leaf Trail  
 
Extension of the trail that directs pedestrian and bike trafc through 
the lower lawn area  
 
2) 
Construct path from River Park to lower vehicle tunnel entrance to 
Hubbard Park.  In the absence of access from the Oak Leaf Trail at the 
southern end of River Park, access via the northern end of River Park may be 
an acceptable alternative.  Access by this route would also require signage 
and a path from the trail. 
 
3) 
Establish entry monument / sign at the new pathway at the intersection with 
the Oak Leaf Trail.

4) 
Construct a paved path extension within the lower terrace area that diverts 
from the Youth Pavilion toward the river’s edge and connects to the existing 
concrete path at the base of the terraced slope.  Benches should be installed 
along this curved sidewalk path to encourage more use of this area of the 
park.  
 
5) 
Install native shrub and perennial plantings in the lower terrace on the 
south side of the concrete pathway extension, to dene the ground plane and 
provide habitat for urban wildlife that utilize the site. While this will require 
elimination of some open turf area, the uses for visitors in this area is 
somewhat limited at present.  
 
6) 
Construct a canoe launch at the river’s edge. Establish a formal path 
connection to the cul-de-sac drop off to facilitate loading and unloading of 
watercraft.  Strongly consider the use of native stone materials to resemble a 
natural rock outcropping.  
 
7) 
Construct a shing / access steps that provide river access at various points 
in the river. 
 
8) 
Excavate the limestone retaining wall near the Youth Pavilion at the base 
of the bluff to the north. Expose the limestone and remove invasive plants, 
thereby commemorating this historic landscape (railroad) feature. This area 
should be restored with native groundcovers. Add safety amenities to 
overpass, deterring recreation at site. 
 
9) 
Construct concrete bench pads and install new bench seating in the lower 
terrace along the existing sidewalk in the vicinity of the limestone retaining 
wall.  
 
 
 
 
HUBBARD PARK 
 
10) 
Stabilize and formalize the nature path along the side of the river that 
extends northwards to Estabrook Park and southwards to the City of 
Milwaukee along the river frontage. Continue working with the Milwaukee 
River Greenway Coalition. 
 
11) 
Replace luminaries / light portions of park lamp xtures   (12) with a 
design that is more contextually t with the Hubbard Park Lodge (1930s).  
 
12) 
Fabricate and install interpretive signage (3) and a park map that allows 
visitors to understand the cultural and natural history of park resources and 
current efforts by the Milwaukee River Greenway Coalition. 
 
13) 
Replace wooden stairs and seating benches, as appropriate. Ensure that 
deteriorating wood is either restored, or that the replacement of these 
features ensures long-term durability.

Natural Areas  
 
14) 
Remove invasive and unhealthy vegetation (such as buckthorn) to improve 
ecological condition of the bluff and river edge environments, and 
revegetate with native, fruit-bearing shrubs and trees to enhance bird and 
wildlife habitat. Remove hazardous or unhealthy trees to allow for sunlight to 
reach the ground plane.  
 
15) 
Supplement native vegetation in areas of disturbance, including along 
portions of the river’s edge to discourage Canada geese from accessing the 
lower turf area.  Establish perennial beds and native shrubs to further deter 
unwanted wildlife.  
 
16) 
Install “restoration in progress” signage in discrete locations along the 
lower nature trail, thereby discouraging foot trafc along the bluff slope and 
alerting bikers to consider the ecological sensitivity of the riverine 
environment.  
 
17) 
Protection of ecologically significant plant community which includes 
endangered species. Area directly north of Hubbard Park should be 
managed as a sanctuary so as to protect one of the few remaining high 
quality plant community remnants in Southeastern Wisconsin. 
 
 
  
 
 
HUBBARD PARK 
RIVER PARK EVALUATION  
STRENGTHS  
Well-maintained sports elds.  River Park provides high-quality facilities for young adult 
and youth active sports. The park maintains excellent turf play elds (baseball / soccer) 
that are irrigated and programmed for both practice and game play.  Pesticides are not 
used to maintain the fields. Support facilities include a shelter, restrooms and a pavilion 
structure.  
Well-maintained pavilion and restrooms opened to the public during Little League 
games, offering food and beverages. 
Access to the Oak Leaf Trail.  River Park is easily accessed via the Oak Leaf Trail, and 
provides a direct connection to the Oakland Avenue business district through the southern 
section of the park.  
Permanent batting cage replaced a temporary structure. 
 
WEAKNESSES  
Lack of turf area for soccer use.  River Park represents the only Village-managed 
recreation space that accommodates soccer uses for practice, game play and clinics. At 
present, soccer is played in the open eld area within the western area of the park, and is 
limited to one soccer eld. Although public schools provide use of playelds for soccer 
league play, school grounds are also utilized by programs managed though the School 
District Recreation and Community Services Department.  
Lack of additional ball diamonds. As the Village’s premier baseball facility (Spector 
Field), River Park provides a high quality level of service for competitive Little League 
games.  However, the absence of a second baseball diamond prevents consolidation of 
local baseball activity within a single park site.  
 
RIVER PARK 
Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan 
 
 
 
61 | P a g e  
 
Absence of a circuit pathway system. Although the existing path affords a direct 
connection between Oakland Avenue and the Oak Leaf Trail, it does not provide for a 
circuit that allows park users to access the park from various locations.  
Absence of connection from Edgewood Avenue to the southern park path. The park 
does not have a path or sidewalk at the corner of Edgewood and Oakland that goes into 
the park and connects with the path that leads to the Oak Leaf Trail. Users accessing the 
park from the south or directly from the east do not enter by way of the center path. 
Pedestrians and bicyclists entering at Edgewood walk through the parking lot to access 
the park. 
Underutilized acreage. The southwest corner of the park is marked by remnants of an 
earlier park design and includes a covered picnic shelter. A shuffleboard was removed in 
2009 to help improve the space.  The shelter feature is not fully integrated into the 
remainder of the park design and is not of high-quality design.  
Lack of diverse park offerings. River Park provides well maintained active sports elds 
for youth, but diverse recreation offerings for other age groups is currently limited, such as 
a playground. 
Feeling of exposure. The openness of the sports eld acreage creates a feeling of 
exposure to the natural elements. Although the western perimeter of the park is enclosed 
by a vegetation buffer, the northern area of the park is ill-dened against a backdrop of 
large buildings or vehicular parking lots.  
 
 
 
RIVER PARK 
RIVER PARK RECOMMENDATIONS  
1) 
Construct a circuit-path (8’ width) around the western edge of the sports 
elds that enables park users to travel the periphery of the park, and gain 
access along a choice of entry points. The path should link to the existing 
sidewalk near the multi-family housing complex and extend into the southern 
wooded area. 
 
2) 
Construct a boardwalk stairway and path to the Hubbard Park parking lot 
that provides formal access from the northern portion of the soccer eld area. 
The lower terminus of the boardwalk stairway should continue northward via 
a paved path to the juncture of Menlo Avenue and Morris Street.  
 
3) 
Remove the planting node along the existing path near the open shelter 
and replace with bench seating.  
 
4) 
Add bike racks in park.  No bike racks exist. 
 
5) 
Install benches along the entire circuit path.  
 
6) 
Install lighting along the entire circuit path.  
 
7) 
Plant street tree vegetation (buffer) along the northern perimeter of the 
baseball eld and soccer eld to provide for visual screening of the urban 
environment to the north.  
 
8) 
Install additional plantings along the Oakland Avenue pedestrian entry. 
 
9) 
Establish entry monument / sign at the path access location at the Oak Leaf 
Trail and along Oakland Avenue.   
 
10) 
Replace the open picnic shelter at a location adjacent to the northwest face 
of the existing enclosed pavilion.  
 
11) 
Construct a small tot lot playground or other playscape near the existing 
ball diamond (to the east of the concession/restroom facility), and ensure that 
seating and shade is provided for caregivers.  
 
12) 
Construct a skatepark in the southwest corner of the park to the west of the 
open picnic shelter. 
 
13) 
Construct a path from Edgewood Avenue into the park along the southern 
park boundary. 
 
14) 
Replace/improve public parking lot signage.

ESTABROOK PARK EVALUATION  
STRENGTHS  
Diversity of active and passive recreational uses. Estabrook Park maintains signicant 
natural areas along the bluff and upland areas, and accommodates passive and active 
recreational uses through sports elds, picnic areas, sand volleyball courts, an in-line 
hockey court, playgrounds, disc golf, a nature trail, and paved (10’ wide) 
bicycle/pedestrian route.  
A dog park was added in 2011 and a Beer Garden in 2012.  Both amenities have been 
very successful, drawing people from around the region and connecting neighbors. 
 
WEAKNESSES  
Pedestrian and bicycle access from the Village and the Oak Leaf Trail. Due to its 
location along the western periphery of the Village, and barriers such as Wilson Drive, 
convenient access to the park is limited. In particular, there is only one formal access from 
the Oak Leaf Trail that traverses the park’s eastern boundary, and three formal access 
points from the Village (E. Congress Street tunnel, E. Kensington and the sidewalk on 
Capitol Drive).  
Lack of visitor use during some seasons.  Like many outdoor recreation areas, Estabrook 
Park is most heavily used during summer months and on weekends. Although there are 
reserveable picnic sites in the park, there are no covered picnic shelters that typically 
generate greater demand and use.  
Deterioration of Building Structures. Estabrook Park was established during the 1930s, 
and retains both building and landscape features that were constructed as part of the 
Works Progress Administration (WPA). Two of the three buildings of historic interest 
(southern restroom facility, lower falls restroom/pavilion, maintenance/restroom building) 
are underutilized (and often closed to use) due to deterioration and risks of vandalism.  
 
Invasive Plants. Estabrook Park is characterized by pockets of high quality vegetation, 
intermingled with zones that support substantial invasive plant species. In particular, 
buckthorn and garlic mustard are common.  
Overlapping and Shared Boundaries. Estabrook Park is owned and managed by 
Milwaukee County, yet the park acreage lies within the municipal boundaries of three 
communities -- the Villages of Shorewood and Whitesh Bay and the City of Milwaukee. 
The southern two-thirds of the park (between the lagoon feature and Capitol Drive) lie 
within the Village of Shorewood. The northern portion of the park (Lower Falls shing area 
as well as the parking lot that serves this facility) is within the boundaries of the City of 
Milwaukee.   Furthermore, the west bank of the Milwaukee River corridor falls within the 
jurisdictions of both the Cities of Glendale and Milwaukee. The complexity of municipal 
boundary congurations that overlay this County-owned park may represent an obstacle 
to creating municipal partnerships that assist with implementation of park improvements.

ESTABROOK PARK RECOMMENDATIONS  
The Village of Shorewood should establish a cooperative relationship with Milwaukee 
County Parks in pursuing the following projects within Estabrook Park:  
MAINTENANCE BUILDING AREA  
 
Construct a path connection between the lagoon feature in Estabrook Park 
and west Glendale Avenue in Shorewood at the intersection of Wilson Drive.  
Crosswalk design should be implemented to reduce conicts between vehicles 
and pedestrians.  
 
 
Complete a formal hard path between Wilson Drive and Kensington 
Boulevard to the Oak Leaf Trail and into the park. 
 
 
Strengthen pedestrian access at Congress Street and Estabrook Park that 
includes at-grade crossings.  
 
 
Secure a trail easement and construct a path at West Olive Street that 
extends between the Village and the Oak Leaf Trail in the vicinity of the 
existing radio tower.  
 
 
Construct a shelter / pavilion at the southern end of the lagoon.  
 
 
Remove out-building structures at the rear of the maintenance building to 
accommodate construction of the trail linkage.  
 
LOWER FALLS RECREATION AREA 
 
 
Improve turf quality and drainage of the open eld to the north of the 
building to accommodate greater active sports uses.  
 
 
Construct a covered picnic shelter in the vicinity of the large parking lot to 
help activate this space for other uses.  
 
 
Construct a skate park that is accessible from the multipurpose pathway and 
parking facilities, and is visible from the roadway.  
 
 
Expand the existing baseball diamond for adult leagues.  
 
 
Remove the in-line hockey court.  
 
 
Formalize social paths along the River, and include waynding signage.  
 
SOUTH PICNIC AREA  
 
Restore existing restroom (seasonal use).  
 
 
Construct a covered picnic shelter to help activate this space.  
 
 
Regrade the existing soccer elds in the southern portion of the park to 
accommodate larger elds for active play than currently exist. Ensure 
appropriate field maintenance. 
 
NATURAL AREAS THROUGHOUT THE PARK  
 
Remove dense understory shrubs surrounding parking lots and open areas, 
including picnic areas.  Most of these shrubs are characterized as invasive 
species (e.g., honeysuckle, common buckthorn). In addition to improving the 
ecological benets of the sites, vegetation removal will afford greater 
visibility into common space.  
 
 
Target the higher-quality woods along the Milwaukee River and in the 
central portion of the park for management, mainly in the form of invasive 
species control.  Some plantings of native shrubs and trees along woodland 
edges, such as native ornamental tree species, should also be implemented. 
This entire corridor that abuts the Milwaukee Rives represents a candidate for 
grant funding potential as it is an important, well-known bird and wildlife 
habitat.

OAK LEAF TRAIL EVALUATION  
STRENGTHS  
High quality standard of trail design. The Trail follows the original grade of the rail line, 
and is of adequate width for commuter and recreational uses. Anticipated extension of the 
Trail to the northern Milwaukee County line will likely generate greater use of the Trail 
through Shorewood.  
 
WEAKNESSES  
Access to and from Village destinations. At present, access is limited between the Trail 
and the Village.  Before the reconstruction of the Trail bridge over Capitol Drive in 2010, 
formal trail entrance were at River Park at the south and Congress Street at the north.  
When the new bridge was constructed, new entry ramps were built on the north and south 
side of Capitol Drive.  A wood chipped path was added at Wilson in 2014. Other points 
of entry are substandard or have been established as dirt paths.  
Visibility and the Perception of Hazards. Most of the Trail corridor that extends through 
Shorewood is visually screened by vegetation or by the rear faces of buildings.  Much of 
the vegetation alongside the corridor is of poor quality, and is marked by invasive species 
and unhealthy tree specimens.  Perceptions of danger and unsafe conditions are a result 
of poor visual access to the Trail. However, the screening creates a natural corridor 
appreciated by users. 
  
OAK LEAF TRAIL RECOMMENDATIONS  
The Village of Shorewood should establish a cooperative relationship with Milwaukee 
County Parks in pursuing the following projects related to the County Oak Leaf Trail:  
1) 
Construct new trail connections between the Village and the Oak Leaf Trail 
at the following locations:  
 
Hubbard Park (1) - Construct a formal connection that provides 
access from the Oak Leaf Trail to the lower portion of Hubbard Park. 
The location of this intersection should mirror the location of the 
primary access point to River Park.  
 
Olive Street (1) - Work with willing private land owners along the 
west side of Wilson Drive to secure a trail easement that extends 
between the Village and the Oak Leaf trail in the vicinity of the 
existing radio tower (see above, Estabrook Park).  
 
 
Alpine Avenue (1) - Construct a trail connection that extends from the 
Oak Leaf Trail to Alpine Avenue to the east and Estabrook Park to 
the west.   
 
Glendale Avenue (1) - Construct a trail connection that extends from 
the Oak Leaf Trail to Glendale Avenue to the east and Estabrook 
Park to the west.   
 
Kensington Boulevard (1) - Formalize the trail connection that extends 
from the Oak Leaf Trail to Kensington Boulevard to the east and 
Estabrook Park to the west, made of a hard surface. 
 
2) 
Remove invasive vegetation within the trail corridor.  
 
3) 
Install and maintain native vegetation within the trail corridor.  
 
4) 
Create signing at key access points.

ATWATER SCHOOL EVALUATION  
STRENGTHS  
High visibility, access, and diversity of uses that accommodate school and community 
recreational programs. The central location of the school within the Village, and proximity 
to the commercial district promotes the site for community (after-school) uses. The school 
grounds provide facilities that are shared between school and community.  
 
WEAKNESSES  
Irregular Design of the Kindergarten Tot-lot. The Kindergarten tot-lot that faces Capitol 
Drive is sizeable by normal standards (24,000 sq. ft. or .5 acre), yet is basic in its offering 
for both structured play and opportunities for discovery. The playground site possesses 
great potential to accommodate a noteworthy recreational facility for the community and 
school that incorporates site-specic design, interaction with nature, accessibility and 
dramatic play, and customized climbing features.  
Drop-off lanes at the Kindergarten Wing. The existing drop-off feature remains closed to 
vehicles due to poor design and hazardous conditions. The acreage that accommodates 
the drop-off is therefore underutilized. At present, curb-side drop-off at this location is not 
a viable and safe option during school hours.  
Poor Condition of Sports Fields. The multi-purpose soccer and baseball elds to the rear 
of the school is characterized by a poor and uneven soil substrate that does not support 
healthy growth of turf. This condition generates a safety hazard, especially for soccer 
participants.  
Dearth of shade within playgrounds. There is not sufcient protection from sun within the 
Kindergarten (east) and Elementary (west) playgrounds.  
 
ATWATER SCHOOL RECOMMENDATIONS  
1) Construct a new tot-lot playground adjacent to the Kindergarten Wing as the 
“premier” community facility for small children. Due to its visibility, accessibility, 
and sizeable area, this location is appropriate for developing an exemplary 
recreational area that includes a variety of stations along a circuit path, and 
encourages children’s play on standard play equipment and on equipment 
customized for self-discovery. Ensure that seating and play equipment is sheltered 
by shade during the warmest periods of the day.  In 2015 the School formed a 
committee to begin discussions for replacing the playground. 
 
 
2) Upgrade the existing rear turf playeld through regrading, soil amending and 
irrigation.  Ensure that the quality of the turf is adequate for both game and 
practice purposes.   
 
3) Upgrade the existing ball diamond and realign peripheral fencing to 
accommodate bleacher seating.  
 
4) Reconstruct the existing vehicular drop-off lane and the Kindergarten entry 
court.  Construct a curb-side drop-off facility that accommodates 9-10 vehicles, 
and recongure the sidewalk along the edge of the curb.  
 
5) Modify the existing parking and loading area north of the Kindergarten Building 
to provide for 15 parking spaces. Reconguration of the driveway and parking 
area could potentially accommodate an additional 10-14 spaces to be rented to 
Village residents, and generate a constant stream of revenue for improvements of 
the Atwater School grounds.  
 
6) Install shade trees within the west paved playground area.  
 
7) Install shrub plantings along the west edge of the front entry lawn.

LAKE BLUFF SCHOOL EVALUATION  
STRENGTHS  
Diversity of uses that accommodate school and community recreational programs.   
Lake Bluff Elementary school grounds provides facilities that are shared between school 
and community, and include sports elds and playgrounds.  
Sizeable expanse of open turf for active sports. Other than River Park – which was 
designed primarily for active sports uses – the school grounds at Lake Bluff Elementary 
accommodate the most intensive uses for baseball, softball and soccer. In 2011 the fields 
were regraded and repositioned.  The two tennis courts were removed as part of the 
project. 
Ice skating rink was regraded for improved use. 
 
WEAKNESSES  
Lack of tennis courts. The two tennis courts at the northwest corner were removed in 2011 
with an expectation new courts would be constructed in the northeast corner of the school 
grounds. 
  
LAKE BLUFF SCHOOL RECOMMENDATIONS  
1) 
Reconstruct tennis courts (2) in the northeast section of the school grounds. 
Reconfigure the staff parking lot to accommodate relocation of the tennis 
courts.  
 
2) 
Remove and reconstruct the warming hut and garage structure to the south.

Bioswales and rain gardens were added to the Oakland Avenue parking lot when it was 
resurfaced in 2008, capturing and filtering storm water runoff. 
New stadium seating and upper media box was constructed following the new athletic 
field.  
Approved 2015 grant for construction of new concessions, bathrooms and team 
rooms under current bleachers,  
 
 
 
 
HIGH SCHOOL AND SHOREWOOD INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL

WEAKNESSES 
Underutilization of front lawn along Capitol Drive, encompassing 2.8 acres of the high 
school campus. It spans over 1,000 feet of Capitol Drive and contains swaths of 
underutilized space.  The buildings on the parcel have setbacks in excess of 150 feet from 
Capitol Drive. This condition de-emphasizes the architectural significance of the school as 
there is no definitive edge to differentiate the school property from the public way along 
Capitol Drive. The front lawn is currently used for informal play and various Recreation 
Department clesses. 
Limited number of tennis courts is used by the High School and SIS and restricts full 
access during the boys and girls tennis season. 
 
HIGH SCHOOL & INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1) Create a defined edge along the lawn to better define the school property and 
create additional space for public events, such as by building a series of 
colonnades along Capitol Drive to create a series of plazas. 
 
2) Screen community gardens along the eastern side of the campus. 
 
3) Install shrub plantings along key areas, delineating changes in space, such as 
between the front lawn and athletic field entrance.  
 
TRIANGLE PARK EVALUATION 
STRENGTHS 
Appropriately located in the middle of Shorewood’s northwest residential one- and two-
family neighborhood and has the potential to serve as a play area for neighborhood 
children.  The park is 0.22 acres. 
 
WEAKNESSES 
Underutilized and oddly shaped neighborhood park with a flagpole located within the 
middle of the park. 
 
 
TRIANGLE PARK RECOMMENDATIONS 
1) Relocate flagpole to edge of park to provide for greater open space. 
 
2) Construct natural or formal playscape along western section, leaving open space 
along the eastern section. 
 
HUMBLE PARK EVALUTION 
STRENGTHS 
Serves as a gateway into the community when entering from the southern border of 
Shorewood, along Oakland Avenue.  Entry markers made of brick and ornate iron arches 
line both sides of Oakland Avenue as well. 
Interior paths match pedestrian foot traffic, crossing the space diagonally at Oakland 
Avenue and Edgewood Boulevard. 
 
WEAKNESSES 
Gateway entrance is asymmetrical without a similar space along the western side of 
Oakland Avenue. 
 
HUMBLE PARK RECOMMENDATIONS 
1) Create landscaped open space along west side of Oakland Avenue across from 
Humble Park to enhance Shorewood’s southern gateway.

POTENTIAL INTERPRETIVE TOPICS  
Effective interpretive themes help to cohesively develop meaningful ideas, and encourage 
park visitors to understand and appreciate a specic park site.  Interpretation of park 
resources may be revealed through a variety of tools that include wayside signage, maps, 
and on-site lectures. The following are potential topics that will assist park visitors to link a 
tangible resource to an intangible interpretive – meaning.

IMPLEMENTATION 
Section 7 
 
This Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan sets forth a bold road map for future 
recreation facility development and open space acquisition for the Village of Shorewood. 
The planning process that enabled the development of the Outdoor Recreation Plan 
commenced with the adoption of the document in 2007 and an update to the plan in 
2015. The following section highlights several next steps that should be undertaken to 
begin the process of plan implementation. These include:  
 
Utilize the plan on a daily basis;  
 
Ensure that municipal funds for recreation facility improvements are included 
in the annual municipal budget;  
 
Promote cooperation and participation among various agencies, 
organizations, community groups and individuals;  
 
Prepare annual goals;  
 
Explore possible funding sources and implementation techniques.  
 
USE THE PLAN ON A DAILY BASIS  
The plan serves as a resourceful inventory of public recreation spaces, and represents the 
Village’s ofcial guide for park and recreation improvements. It is essential that the plan is 
used as a reference tool among Village staff when considering policies and actions that 
directly and indirectly involves the management, maintenance, security, and development 
of public recreational spaces.  
ENSURE ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT 
FUNDS  
The strongest tool for implementing the plan is the Capital Projects Fund. It establishes 
schedules and priorities for park improvements annually. Although funding of recreational 
facility improvements will rely on various extramural sources and partnerships, inclusion of 
park enhancements within the Capital Projects Program is paramount for plan success.  
PROMOTE COOPERATION AND PARTICIPATION  
The Village of Shorewood should assume a primary leadership role in providing 
recreational experiences within the community. However, to carry out some of the 
recommendations set forth in this plan, the Village will need to rely on cooperation from 
other groups and organizations. In order for the plan to be successful it must be based on 
a strong partnership between the Village, the School District of Shorewood, Milwaukee 
County, other public agencies, programming afliates, neighborhood groups and 
organizations, and the private sector. The Village should lead and promote the 
cooperation and collaboration required to implement the new plan. The Village’s partners 
should include:  
 
Other governmental and service districts, such as the City of Milwaukee, City 
of Glendale, Village of Whitesh Bay, Milwaukee County Parks and 
Recreation Department, and School District of Shorewood 
 
Afliate organizations, such as the Friends of Atwater Beach, the Friends of 
Estabrook Park, the Cambridge Woods Neighborhood Association, the River 
Revitalization Foundation, Friends of Milwaukee’s Rivers, and Milwaukee River 
Greenway Coalition 
 
Independent recreation organizations such as the Shorewood Kickers (soccer), 
Shorewood Little League, Shorewood Girls Softball, Shorewood Lacrosse 
Club, School District of Shorewood Recreation and Community Services 
Department  
 
Builders and developers that undertake redevelopment projects on parcels 
contiguous to park sites, trail corridors or river environments  
 
Village residents that participate in on-going park and school ground 
planning and budgeting processes 
 
Property owners, who control acreage that affords opportunities to improve 
pedestrian and bicycle access to parks, trails and river environments  
 
PREPARE ANNUAL GOALS  
The Village, in conjunction with the Parks Commission should continue to develop annual 
goals as part of the implementation for this plan. Each of this plan’s recommendations will 
entail a multi-step process that should be recognized and addressed. The annual goals 
Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan 
 
 
 
95 | P a g e  
 
will serve as an implementation action agenda which highlights the improvements, 
developments, designs and other activities to be undertaken during the next few years.  
In order to remain current, the action agenda should be updated once a year.  
 
EXPLORE FUNDING SOURCES AND IMPLEMENTATION 
TECHNIQUES  
The recommendations of the plan vary greatly in nancial considerations necessary to 
implement and to develop facilities. Since many of the projects and improvements called 
for in the plan will require matching funds, others will require sources, such as bonding, or 
special technical and/or financial assistance.  
The Village should continue to explore and consider the wide range of local, state and 
federal resources and programs that may be available to assist in the implementation of 
the plan’s recommendations.

APPENDIX 
FUNDING 
There are a number of potential funding sources available to help nance implementation 
of recreation facilities. The Village should also coordinate efforts with other units of 
government, governmental departments and public agencies and private and non-prot 
agencies to help fund and implement the recommendations presented in this Plan.  
In addition to extramural funding, costs associated with recreation facility improvements 
and maintenance should be incorporated in Village Capital Improvement plans and 
programs.  
GRANT PROGRAMS  
The Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program was established by the Wisconsin Legislature 
in 1989 for a ten-year period. In 2007 the program was renewed to fiscal year 2019-
20. The goals of the Stewardship Program are to protect and restore nature-based 
outdoor recreation areas and areas having scenic or ecological value.  Nature-based can 
best be described as activities where the primary focus or purpose is the appreciation or 
enjoyment of nature. The Stewardship Program is nanced through the issuance of general 
obligation bonds and is expected to distribute about $80 million annually statewide for 
the ten-year period of the program. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 
(DNR) administers the Stewardship Program.  
The Stewardship Program is an umbrella for a number of subprograms, each with its own 
goals, priorities, and criteria, which are summarized below.  Projects submitted for grants 
under the Stewardship Program must be included in a locally-adopted park plan.  
Urban Green Space (UGS) is a Statewide program which provides up to 50 percent 
matching grants to local and county units of government and NCOs to acquire or 
protect scenic, ecological, or other natural features within or near urban areas and 
provide land for nature-based outdoor recreation, including noncommercial 
gardening. These funds can be used for the acquisition of land only. [Application 
deadline - May 1 of each year]  
(The DNR denes “nature-based” outdoor recreation as activities where the primary 
focus or purpose is the appreciation or enjoyment of nature. Such activities include 
hiking, bicycling, wildlife or nature observation, camping, nature study, shing, hunting, 
picnicking, cross-country skiing, canoeing, and multi-use trail activities. Playgrounds are 
also considered “nature-based” facilities.  Support facilities such as access roads, 
parking, signs, utility and restroom buildings, and habitat restoration are also eligible 
for funding under the Stewardship program).  
 
 
 
 
Urban Rivers (URGP) is a Statewide program which provides up to 50 percent 
matching grants to local and county units of government and NCOs to purchase land 
or easements, or to develop shoreline enhancements on or adjacent to rivers that ow 
through urban or urbanizing areas. This program is intended to preserve or restore 
urban rivers or riverfronts for the purpose of revitalization and nature-based outdoor 
recreation activities. NCOs can use these funds for the acquisition of land or 
easements only. [Application deadline - May 1 of each year]  
Acquisition of Development Rights program is a Statewide program which provides 
up to 50 percent matching grants to local and county units of government and NCOs 
to acquire development rights (conservation easements) in areas where restrictions on 
residential, commercial, or industrial development would help protect natural, 
agricultural, or forestry values and enhance nature-based outdoor recreation. 
[Application deadline - May 1 of each year]  
The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) program was established by the 
U.S. Congress in 1964 to provide funding for the acquisition of land for park or open 
space preservation purposes and the development of outdoor recreation facilities. In 
Wisconsin, LAWCON funds are administered by the DNR. Up to 50 percent of project 
costs are eligible for funding under this program. The “nature-based” restriction in the 
Stewardship Program does not apply to LWCF funds.  [Application deadline - May 1 
of each year]  
The National Trails Program (RTP) grant program provides funds through the transfer 
of Federal gas taxes paid on fuel used by off-highway vehicles. These funds are used 
to develop and maintain recreational trails and trail-related facilities for both 
motorized and non-motorized trail uses. The program is administered by the DNR. 
Funds are available to county and local units of government, State and Federal 
agencies, school districts, and qualied trail organizations. Matching grants for up to 
50 percent of the cost of a recreational trail project are available. [Application 
deadline - May 1 of each year]  
The Urban and Community Forestry Grant Program provides grants of up to 50 
percent to county and local units of government and nonprot conservation 
organizations for urban forestry activities. Eligible activities include development of an 
urban forestry plan or urban open space program, development of a tree ordinance, 
development of a public awareness program, conducting street tree inventories, and 
tree planting and maintenance. Reimbursement is limited to $25,000 per project. 
[Application deadline - October 1 of each year]  
The River Protection Grant Program, administered by the DNR, is intended to protect or 
improve rivers and natural river ecosystems, including water quality, sheries habitat, and 
natural beauty. $300,000 is distributed annually statewide. The program includes the 
following two subprograms:  
River Planning Grants. This program provides grants of up to 75 percent to county 
and local units of government, nonprot conservation organizations, and qualied 
river management organizations. Eligible activities include river organization 
 
 
 
 
development, educational efforts, assessments of water quality and aquatic life, and 
non-point source evaluations. Reimbursement is limited to $10,000 per project. 
[Application deadline - May 1 of each year]  
River Management Grants. This program provides grants of up to 75 percent to 
county and local units of government, nonprot conservation organizations, and 
qualied river management organizations. Eligible activities include purchase of land 
or easements, development of local ordinances, and restoration of in-stream or 
shoreland habitat. Reimbursement is limited to $50,000 per project. [Application 
deadline - May 1 of each year]  
The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), (formerly ISTEA, TEA 
21) continues the integration of bicycling and walking into the transportation mainstream. 
It enhances the ability of communities to invest in projects that can improve the safety and 
practicality of bicycling and walking for everyday travel.  
MAP-21 combined previously separate Transportation Enhancement (TE), Recreational 
Trails, Safe Routs to School (SRTS), and Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities Programs (BPFP) 
into one funding program called the Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP), under 
SAFETEA-LU. 
Transportation Alternative Program. (TAP) Transportation alternatives are 
transportation-related activities that are designed to strengthen the cultural, aesthetic, 
and environmental aspects of transportation systems. The transportation enhancements 
program provides up to 80 percent matching grants for the implementation of a 
variety of non-traditional transportation projects, including the restoration of historic 
transportation facilities, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, landscaping and scenic 
beautication, and mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff. Most of the 
requests and projects awarded in Wisconsin have been for bicycle facilities. Examples 
of bicycle projects include multi-use trails (in greenways and former rail trails, for 
example), paved shoulders, bicycle lanes, bicycle route signage, bicycle parking, and 
overpasses or underpasses.  
Transportation enhancement activities must relate to surface transportation. Federal 
regulations restrict the use of Federal funds on trails that allow motorized vehicles, 
except snowmobiles. 
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. (CMAQ) is under 
MAP-21. The purpose of the CMAQ program is to provide up to 80 percent matching 
grants for projects and programs that reduce motor vehicle travel and/or emissions in 
areas that have failed to meet air quality standards for ozone, carbon monoxide 
(CO), or small particulate matter. Bicycle and pedestrian projects are eligible for 
CMAQ if they reduce the number of vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled. Almost all 
bicycle projects eligible for TAP grant programs are likely to be eligible, but a higher 
burden of proof that the project will reduce air pollution is required. Non-construction 
activities such as maps and brochures are also eligible for funding.
