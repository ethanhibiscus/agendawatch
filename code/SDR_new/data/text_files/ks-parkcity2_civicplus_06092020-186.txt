Department propose purchasing two replacement vehicles to be designated as marked patrol vehicles, along

DISCUSS AND CONSIDER APROVING THE PURCHASE OF A REPLACEMENT UTILITY
TERRAIN VEHICLE AND 72” MOWER FOR THE PARKS DEPARTMENT

Page 4 
Assistant Public Works Director Zach Day stated during the 2020 budget cycle, Public Works completed 
an assessment of departmental equipment requiring replacement.  He stated the Parks Department 
determined their 2004 John Deere Gator Utility Vehicle and the 2015 Gravely 472 72” Zero turn Mower 
was in dire need of replacement.  Mr. Day stated the John Deere has 1746 hrs. and the Gravely has 802 hrs. 
and both machines have seen a substantial increase in repair cost and price depreciation.  He stated staff 
sought estimates from more than eight dealership and received three proposals for the utility vehicle and 
five for the mower.  Mr. Day stated he put together options from the top three quotes for both the utility 
terrain vehicle and the mower.  He stated option two had a trade allowance.   
Council Member Brandi Baily asked why the recommendation was for the Ravenscraft Implement quotes 
rather than a local vendor.  Mr. Day stated the Kubota is all factory made.  He stated it was a better quality.  
He stated two of the three vendors brought equipment for the Public Works Department to test.  He stated 
the Kubota equipment overall performance was better.  Ms. Baily asked if the Kubota utility terrain vehicle 
could come with a level lift bed.  Mr. Day stated unfortunately not.  He stated that was the one positive 
option the Hustler utility terrain vehicle had in its quote.

of $35,852.72 for a 2020 Kubota RTV-X1100 ($21,874.37) and a 2020 Kubota ZD121127 hp Diesel 72”

Agenda Item #4 
Prepared By: Eric Miner, Public Works Director 
Summary: 
DISCUSS AND CONSIDER APPROVING PURCHASE OF A STREET SWEEPER 
Background: 
Street sweeping is not only for the safety of our residents and visually pleasing it also removes debris 
from the gutter and roadside that would otherwise end up in the storm drain, causing water pollution 
and ensures were are in compliance with the MS4 program. We have pursued the possibility of 
partnering up with other cities for a combined purchase, and the City has outsourced the street 
sweeping on three separate occasions and found that it was not timely enough and not economically 
viable to continue.   
Staff researched numerous models/designs of street sweepers and narrowed it down to two that 
would work for the city. The Elgin Broom Badger at $208,159 and The TYMCO Model 600 at 
$246,026. 
Fiscal Impact 
Unbudgeted; To be paid out of Fund 21 
Staff Recommendation 
Staff recommends purchase of the ELGIN Broom Badger.

Agenda Item #7 
Prepared By: Doug Moshier, City Attorney 
Summary: 
CONSIDER ADOPTING AN ORDINANCE AMENDING SECTION 14-205 OF THE 
MUNICIPAL CODE RELATING TO ON-STREET PARKING RESTRICTIONS IN THE 
CITY. 
Background: 
Members of the Council have expressed concerns about certain on-street parking 
restrictions on several streets in the City.   
Staff has conducted an inventory of these and other city streets to determine the feasibility 
of removing parking restrictions that currently exist on only one side of several residential 
streets.  The width of these streets is such that allowing parking on both sides of the street 
would not constitute a traffic safety hazard or prohibit the passage of fire trucks.  It would, 
however, make passage of traffic going in opposite directions something that would 
require drivers to make accommodations to account for the narrow passageways that 
could exist with cars parked on both sides of the street. 
Fiscal Impact 
None. 
Staff Recommendation 
None.  Action to be determined by the City Council. 
Attachments 
Proposed ordinance amending Section 14-205 of the Municipal Code.
