.  
Presentation from Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company (GRS) regarding overview of
valuation and discuss new proposed mortality assumptions
GRS gave an educational presentation of Pension Liability Basics including the core principles 
of how they evaluate the liability of the Plan and set and introduce assumptions.  Discussion 
from the February 12, 2020 meeting continued regarding the mortality assumptions.  During the 
last meeting, Committee member, Sean Sullivan explained the GRS proposed mortality 
assumptions to the Committee.  Sean recommended to the Committee, for pre-retirement 
mortality assumptions, using the Pub-2010 general tables for both male and female (separate 
tables) as they are a better fit for the Plan population.  The Committee discussed for post-
2 
retirement, using the TMRS experience-based table called the 2019 Municipal Retirees of 
Texas. 
Action:  Sean Sullivan moved to adopt the TMRS post-retirement mortality assumptions as
done in the past and adopt the Pub-2010 general above average tables (separate tables for 
both men and women) salary weighted for pre-retirement mortality assumptions.  Karen Rhodes 
seconded the motion.  The motion was approved and carried 5-0.

RVK, INC.

Period Ended: March 31, 2020
2019 Greenwich Quality Leader Award
We are deeply grateful for your continued confidence and support. 
From all of us here at RVK, thank you for the opportunity to serve you!
Greenwich Associates recently announced that RVK is 1 of 3 firms among large US
consultants to receive the 2019 Greenwich Quality Leader award.
We are proud to announce the 3rd consecutive year of receiving this recognition.
2017
2018
2019
*Between July and October 2019, Greenwich Associates conducted interviews with 1,100 individuals at 896 of the largest tax-exempt funds in the US–including corporate and union funds, public funds, endowments and foundations–with 
either pension or investment pool assets greater than $150 million. Study participants were asked to provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations of their asset managers and investment consultants, including qualitative assessments of
those firms soliciting their business and detailed information on important market trends. RVK is one of three firms recognized in the large investment consultant category. The ratings may not be representative of any one client’s 
experience with RVK; rather they are representative of those clients submitted and that chose to participate in the survey. The results are not indicative of RVK’s future performance.

Key Economic Indicators
The first quarter of 2020 was dramatic as a local outbreak of a previously 
unknown coronavirus in the Hubei Province of China morphed into a global 
pandemic, which led to cases in the millions and casualties in the tens of 
thousands. Governments around the globe closed down huge portions of their 
economies, imposing travel restrictions, cancelling social gatherings, shuttering 
non-essential businesses, and locking down entire cities to reduce the virus’ 
spread. In response, the Federal Reserve announced two emergency rate cuts, 
first by 50 basis points on March 3 and then by 100 basis points on March 16. By 
March 23, the Fed announced open-ended Quantitative Easing alongside a host of 
other liquidity enhancing programs, just as President Trump signed the $2.3 
Trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Securities (CARES) Act into law. 
Markets did not begin heavily discounting the economic risks associated with the 
COVID-19 outbreak until the last week of February. As recently as February 19, 
2020, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high of 3,386. Over the next 3 weeks, the 
S&P 500 closed in bear market territory representing the fastest 20% drawdown 
from an all-time high in the history of the index.

Broad Market
US markets hit their peak in mid-February before growing concerns about the 
spread of COVID-19 caused the S&P 500 to drawdown nearly -34% over the 
remainder of the quarter. However, buoyed by the stimulus provided in the 
CARES Act, the market experienced a 15.5% gain from the trough to end 
Q1.
Market Cap
Small- and mid-cap stocks were hit the hardest by COVID-19 pandemic fears 
with the Russell 2000 and Russell Mid Cap indexes down -30.6% and 
-27.1%, respectively. The Russell 1000 index also ended the quarter down 
-20.2%. 
Style and Sector
Value underperformed growth across all market capitalizations, experiencing 
a sharper drawdown and slower recovery than growth. In addition, active 
management continued to deliver mixed results in Q1 with approximately 
50% providing excess returns.

Non-US Equity Review
As of March 31, 2020
Developed Markets
Developed international markets fared slightly worse than domestic markets 
during Q1 with broad indexes declining nearly 25%. Sectors were negative 
across the board, but defensive sectors, such as healthcare, consumer 
staples, and utilities held up better amidst the volatility. By region, 
performance was not as diverse as it was by sector, although Japan provided 
investors a measure of safety.
Emerging Markets
For the quarter, emerging markets were the worst performing equity asset 
class, trailing by a thin margin. Emerging markets were negative across 
sectors and countries but the disparity by region was wider than the 
developed world, as there was a flight to perceived quality by country.
Market Cap & Style
In both developed international markets and emerging markets, value stocks 
continued to underperform growth, while large-cap stocks outperformed 
small-cap for the quarter.

Fixed Income Performance (%)
Broad Market
COVID-19-related fears and subsequent monetary policy responses led 
Treasury yields to steep declines of more than 100 basis points across all 
maturities. As of March 9th, the 30-year yield ended at just 0.99%, marking 
the first time ever that all maturities ended below the 1% threshold. 
                                                                                                                            
Credit Market
Credit experienced significant selloffs and volatility over the quarter. In all, the 
Bloomberg US Corporate Index returned -3.6% in Q1 with bifurcated returns 
between quality groups as AAA-rated bonds returned 4.7% while BBB-rated 
bonds returned -7.1%.

Emerging market debt suffered from both declining oil prices and coronavirus-
induced reductions in demand. The JPM EMBI Global Diversified Index had 
its worst quarterly decline in more than 20 years, returning -13.4%, worse 
than the total losses experienced in 2008.

Alternatives Review
As of March 31, 2020
General Market - Diversified Inflation Strategies (DIS)
Performance across DIS managers RVK tracks was generally negative 
on an absolute basis during Q1, though there was dispersion among 
strategies driven by exposure differences. In a reversal from 2019, 
managers with larger TIPS allocations tended to outperform peers as 
riskier assets saw relatively large drawdowns during the quarter. 
Managers that underperformed by the widest margins versus peers 
emphasized allocations to REITs, global listed infrastructure and/or 
global natural resource equities in varying proportions.
General Market - Real Estate
Core private real estate returned 0.98% during Q1, as reported by the 
NCREIF-ODCE Index. Total return comprised of a 1.02% gain from 
income with a -0.04% loss due to price appreciation. While the income 
component remained in line with historical levels, price appreciation 
experienced a decrease of -0.51% compared to Q4. Public real estate 
returns trailed private by a wide margin during Q1.
General Market - Hedge Funds
The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index returned -8.3% for the quarter, 
led lower by hedged equity (-13.0%) and event-driven (-15.0%) strategies 
that generally maintain significant net market exposure. Equity Long/Short 
(ELS) managers protected against major capital impairment through strong 
short alpha generation, particularly through bets against stocks in the 
physical retail or travel and leisure sub-sectors.
General Market - Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA)
GTAA managers largely provided negative absolute returns during the 
quarter with long-biased strategies generally underperforming a static and 
less diversified blend of 60% US equity and 40% US fixed income. Strategies 
that provided the weakest relative returns versus peers tended to have higher 
relative allocations to emerging markets equities or exposure to oil markets 
and US small-cap equities. Long-biased managers that outperformed peers 
on a relative basis tended to have more exposure across US markets as 
opposed to emerging markets, both within fixed income and equities.

Glossary
Active Return - The difference between the investment manager/composite performance relative to the performance of an appropriate market 
benchmark.
Active Share - Measures the degree to which the holdings of a fund differ from the holdings of the benchmark. Active share is calculated by taking the 
sum of the absolute value of the differences of the weight of each holding in the fund versus the weight of each holding in the benchmark and dividing by 
two.
Alpha - A measure of the difference between a portfolio's actual returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by beta. It is a 
measure of the portfolio's historical performance not explained by movements of the market or a portfolio's non-systematic return.
Alpha Ratio - A measure of a portfolio's non-systematic return per unit of downside risk. It is measured by dividing the alpha of a portfolio by the 
downside risk. The non-systematic return is a measure of a portfolio's historical performance not explained by movements of the market.
Average Quality - Bond quality ratings are reported using the investment managers' and the index providers' preferred rating agency. Average Quality 
for managers unable to provide this statistic is instead provided by Morningstar; if unavailable on Morningstar, it has been estimated using a credit 
quality distribution provided by the manager. There are two primary rating agencies in the US. Moody's assigns ratings on a system that employs up to 
four symbols (consisting of letters and numbers) such as, Aaa, Aa2, etc., with Aaa being the highest or safest rating. Standard & Poor's (S&P) employs a 
system that uses + and - along with letters such as AAA, AA+, etc. The two rating agencies' systems are summarized below:

Benchmark Effect - The difference between the blended return of each respective managers’ benchmark within a composite and the composite’s 
benchmark return.
Beta - A measure of the sensitivity of a portfolio to the movements in the market. It is a measure of a portfolio's non-diversifiable or systematic risk.
Box Plots - A graphical representation of the distribution of observations. From top to bottom, the four boxes represent the spread between the 
maximum value and the minimum value in each quartile. A quartile represents the values that divide the observations into four quarters (i.e., 1st quartile, 
2nd quartile, 3rd quartile, and 4th quartile). The median observation is where the 2nd quartile and 3rd quartile meet.
Buy and Hold Attribution - At the beginning of the time period under analysis, the manager and benchmark portfolios are broken down into segments 
(i.e., styles, sectors, countries, and regions) based on the desired type of attribution. The formula assumes zero turn-over to the manager and 
benchmark portfolios throughout the period and calculates the segment returns ("buy and hold returns") to arrive at performance attribution. Due to 
portfolio turnover, buy and hold attribution may not accurately represent quarterly performance relative to the benchmark. Country, region, sector, and 
style allocations are as of the date one quarter prior to the reporting date, and the returns shown are for those segments throughout the quarter reported. 
Due to disclosure guidelines set by each investment manager, equity characteristics shown are as of the most recent date available. The following is the 
methodology for segment classification:
Sector - Attribution is calculated using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) which is a detailed and comprehensive structure for sector 
and industry analysis. Stocks are classified by their primary sector, as defined by S&P Capital IQ data.
Country/Region - Attribution is calculated using the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) region standards. Stocks are classified by their 
domicile country/region, as defined by S&P Capital IQ data. 
Style - Stocks are classified into the following style boxes: large/mid/small vs. growth/neutral/value. Stocks are classified along large/mid/small 
categories at the time of the Russell index rebalancing, using the index market cap boundaries as cutoff points. Stocks are classified along 
growth/neutral/value categories at the time of the Russell index rebalancing, using the price/book ratio as supplied by S&P Capital IQ. Stocks in the 
Russell 3000 Index portfolio are sorted by price/book ratio; names with the highest price/book ratio that make up 1/3 of the total market capitalization 
are assigned to the growth category, names that make up the subsequent 1/3 of the total market capitalization are assigned to the neutral category, 
while the balance of the names are assigned to the value category. Stocks are unclassified when there is not enough data to determine a size and 
style metric.
Portfolio Characteristics and Buy and Hold Attribution reports utilize product-specific data for all mutual funds and commingled funds.
Capital Markets Review -
Breakeven Inflation - Measures the expected inflation rate at each stated maturity by taking the difference between the real yield of the inflation-
linked maturity curve and the yield of the closest nominal Treasury maturity.
Consumer Confidence - Measures domestic consumer confidence as defined by the degree of optimism on the state of the economy that 
consumers express through saving and spending.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Measures the change in the price level of consumer goods and services.
Federal Funds Rate - The interest rate at which a depository institution lends funds maintained at the Federal Reserve to another depository 
institution overnight. It is one of the most influential interest rates in the US economy, since it affects monetary and financial conditions, which in turn 
have a bearing on key aspects of the broad economy including employment, growth and inflation.

Glossary
Option-Adjusted Spread - Measures the flat spread of an index or bond to the Treasury yield curve after removing the effect of any embedded        
options.
Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) - Measures economic activity by surveying purchasing managers on a monthly basis as to whether business 
conditions have improved, worsened, or stayed the same.
Real Gross Domestic Product (Real GDP) - An inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy 
in a given year.
US Dollar Total Weighted Index - Measures the value of the US Dollar relative to a basket of other world currencies. It is calculated as the weighted 
geometric mean of the dollar's value versus the EUR, GBP, CAD, SEK, CHF, and JPY.
Unemployment Rate - The percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment.
VIX - Measures the implied volatility of S&P 500 Index options by looking at the market's expectation of the S&P 500 Index volatility over the next 30 
day period. Commonly referred to as the "fear index" or the "fear gauge."
Cash Flow Effect – The composite’s active return minus the sum of each managers’ active return minus the benchmark effect.
Consistency - The percentage of quarters that a product achieved a rate of return higher than that of its benchmark. The higher the consistency figure, 
the more value a manager has contributed to the product's performance.
Convexity - A measure of the shape of the curve that describes the relationship between bond prices and bond yields.
Correlation - A statistical measure of the relationship between asset class returns. A value of 1.00 is a perfect correlation; that is, the asset classes 
always move in the same direction. A value of -1.00 indicates a perfect negative correlation, in which the asset classes always move in opposite 
directions of each other. A value of 0 indicates there is no relationship between the direction of returns of the two asset classes.  Correlation calculations 
only consider the direction of changes relative to two variables and not the magnitude of those changes.
Coupon Rate - The percentage rate of interest paid on a bond or fixed income security; it is typically paid twice per year.
Current Yield - The annual income of a security divided by the security's current price.
Down Market Capture - Down market by definition is negative benchmark return and down market capture represents the ratio in % terms of the 
average portfolios return over the benchmark during the down market period. The lower the value of the down market capture the better the product's 
performance.
Downside Risk - A measure similar to standard deviation, but focuses only on the negative movements of the return series. It is calculated by taking the 
standard deviation of the negative returns for the selected periodicity. The higher the factor, the riskier the product.
Earnings Per Share - It is backward looking, calculated using the one year current EPS divided by the one year EPS five years ago.
Effective Duration - The approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in yield.
Excess Return vs. Market - Average of the monthly arithmetic difference between the manager's return and the benchmark return over a specified time 
period, shown on an annualized basis.
Excess Return vs. Risk Free - Average of the monthly arithmetic difference between the manager's return and the risk-free return (i.e., ICE BofAML 3 
Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise) over a specified time period, shown on an annualized basis.
Excess Risk - A measure of the standard deviation of a portfolio's performance relative to the risk free return.
Expense Ratios - Morningstar is the source for mutual fund expense ratios.  
Gain/Loss - The net increase or decrease in the market value of a portfolio excluding its Net Cash Flow for a given period.
Indices - All indices and related information are considered intellectual property and are licensed by each index provider. The indices may not be 
copied, used or distributed without the index provider's prior written approval. Index providers make no warranties and bear no liability with respect to the 
indices, any related data, their quality, accuracy, suitability and/or completeness.  
Information Ratio - Measured by dividing the active rate of return by the tracking error. The higher the information ratio, the more value-added 
contribution by the manager.
Liability Driven Investing (LDI) - A method to optimally structure asset investments relative to liabilities. The change in liabilities is estimated by the 
Ryan Labs Generic PPA Index of appropriate duration for that Plan. This benchmark is based on generic data and is therefore an approximation. RVK is 
not an actuarial firm, and does not have actuarial expertise.
Estimated Funded Status - The estimated ratio of a Plan's assets relative to its future liabilities. This is calculated by dividing the Plan's asset market 
value by the estimated present value of its liabilities. The higher the estimated funded status, the better the Plan's ability to cover its projected benefit 
obligations. An estimated funded status of 100% indicates a Plan that is fully funded.
Estimated PV of Liabilities - An estimate of a Plan's future liabilities in present value terms. The beginning of the period liability is provided by the 
Plan's actuary. The period-end present value liability estimate provided in this report is derived by applying the estimated percentage change 
generated using the Ryan Labs Generic PPA Index with duration similar to that reported on the most recent actuarial valuation report.
Duration of Liabilities - The sensitivity of the value of a Plan's liabilities to changes in interest rates, as calculated by the Plan's actuary.
Duration of Assets - The dollar-weighted average duration of all the individual Plan assets.
Estimated Plan Hedge Ratio - The estimate of how well a Plan's investment portfolio is hedged against changes in interest rates - a primary driver of 
funded status movements. This is calculated by dividing the dollar-weighted values of both the Plan asset duration by the liability duration and 
multiplying by the estimated funded status. An estimated plan hedge ratio of zero indicates that the Plan's liabilities have not been hedged, whereas a 
value of one indicates fully hedged.

Glossary
Modified Duration - The approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in yield, assuming the bonds’ expected cash 
flows do not change.
Mutual Fund Performance - Whenever possible, manager performance is extended for any share class that does not have 10 years of history. Using 
Morningstar’s methodology, a single ticker within the same fund family (often the oldest share class) is chosen to append historical performance.
Net Cash Flow - The sum, in dollars, of a portfolio's contributions and withdrawals. This includes all management fees and expenses only when 
performance shown is gross of fees.
Peer Groups -
Plan Sponsor Peer Groups - RVK utilizes the Mellon Analytical Solutions Trust Universe along with the Investment Metrics Plan Sponsor Universe. 
The combined Mellon Analytical Solutions Trust Universe and Investment Metrics Plan Sponsor Universe is used for comparison of total fund 
composite results and utilizes actual client performance compiled from consultant and custodian data. The Plan Sponsor Peer Group database 
includes performance and other quantitative data for over 2,100 plans which include corporate, endowment, foundation, public, and Taft Hartley plans. 
Plan Sponsor Peer Groups are gross of fees.
Investment Manager Peer Groups - RVK utilizes Investment Metrics’ Peer Groups for investment manager peer comparison and ranking. The 
Investment Metrics Peer Group database includes performance and other quantitative data for over 840 investment management firms and 29,000 
investments products, across more than 160 standard peer groups. Mutual Fund Peer Groups are net of fees. 
Percentile Rankings - Percentile rank compares an individual fund's performance with those of other funds within a defined peer group of managers 
possessing a similar investment style. Percentile rank identifies the percentage of a fund's peer group that has a higher return (or other comparative 
measurement) than the fund being ranked. Conversely, 100 minus the individual fund's ranking will identify the percentage of funds within the peer group 
that have a lower return than the fund being ranked.
1 - Highest Statistical Value
100 - Lowest Statistical Value
Example: American Funds AMCP;R-4 (RAFEX) is ranked in the 4th percentile within the IM US Equity Large-Cap Growth Funds (MF) Peer Group for the 
Sharpe Ratio. Within the IM US Equity Large-Cap Growth Funds peer group, 4% of the other funds performed better than American Funds AMCP;R-4 
(RAFEX), while 96% of the funds performed worse.
Performance Methodology - RVK calculates performance for investment managers and composites using different methodologies. 
Investment Managers - Performance is calculated for interim periods between all large external cash flows for a given month and geometrically 
linked to calculate period returns. An external cash flow is defined as cash, securities, or assets that enter or exit a portfolio. RVK defines a "large 
cash flow" as a net aggregate cash flow of ≥10% of the beginning-period portfolio market value or any cash flow that causes RVK calculated 
performance to deviate from manager/custodian reported performance in excess of 5 basis points for a given month.
Composites - The Modified Dietz methodology is utilized to calculate asset class, sub-asset class, and total fund composite performance. The 
Modified Dietz method calculates a time-weighted total rate of return that considers the timing of external cash flows; however, it does not utilize 
interim period performance to mitigate the impact of significant cash in- and outflows to the composite.
RVK calculates performance beginning with the first full month following inception. Since inception performance may vary from manager reported 
performance due to RVK using the first full month of returns as the inception date. Performance for both managers and composites is annualized for 
periods greater than one year.
Portfolio Characteristics - Due to disclosure guidelines set by each investment manager, portfolio characteristics shown are as of the most recent date 
available.
Price to Earnings Ratio - The ratio of a company’s share price to its per-share earnings
Private Equity Quartile Ranks - Private Equity quartile ranks are generated using vintage year peer group data provided by Thomson Reuters, and are 
based on each fund’s annualized, since inception internal rate of return (IRR). Three Private Equity peer groups are available via Thomson Reuters: 
Buyout, Venture, and All Private Equity. Ranks are available quarterly, at a one-quarter lag. 
Return - Compounded rate of return for the period.
% Return - The time-weighted rate of return of a portfolio for a given period.
R-Squared - The percentage of a portfolio's performance explained by the behavior of the appropriate benchmark. High R-Squared means a higher 
correlation of the portfolio's performance to the appropriate benchmark.
Risk Free Benchmark – ICE BofAML 3 Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise.

RVK Liquidity Rating - A qualitative method for determining the relative amount of liquidity in a portfolio. The characteristics considered when 
determining relative liquidity include trading volume, gates for redemption, leverage, nature of transactions, and pricing mechanisms. The RVK Liquidity 
Rating is calculated using beginning of month investment weights applied to each corresponding asset class liquidity rating.

Sector Allocation - Negative fixed income sector allocation reflects manager’s use of derivatives, short selling, or interest rate swaps.
Sharpe Ratio - Represents the excess rate of return over the risk-free return (i.e., ICE BofAML 3 Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise), divided 
by the standard deviation of the excess return to the risk free asset. The result is the absolute rate of return per unit of risk. The higher the value, the 
better the product's historical risk-adjusted performance.
Simple Alpha - The difference between the manager's return and the benchmark's return.
Spread Duration - The approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis point change in its spread over a Treasury of the same 
maturity.
Standard Deviation - A statistical measure of the range of a portfolio's performance. The variability of a return around its average return over a specified 
time period.
Time Period Abbreviations - QTD - Quarter-to-Date. CYTD - Calendar Year-to-Date. FYTD - Fiscal Year-to-Date. YOY - Year Over Year.

Total Fund Attribution – The Investment Decision Process (IDP) model provides an approach to evaluating investment performance that applies to all 
asset classes and investment styles. The IDP model is based on a top-down hierarchy framework of investment decisions, with each decision 
contributing to the overall profit or loss. The IDP approach starts from the strategic asset allocation and follows the flow of the investments down to the 
manager’s skill. 
Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) – The percentage return gained or lost from the long-term strategic asset allocation decision, the most significant 
determinant of long-term performance. SAA is the product of the target asset allocation multiplied by the corresponding benchmark returns. 
Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) – The percentage return gained or lost from not having been precisely allocated at the target asset allocation mix, 
whether by deviations that are tactical in nature or a by-product of moving towards the target mix. TAA is the product of the actual asset allocation 
multiplied by the broad asset class benchmarks, less the SAA. 
Style Selection (SS) – The percentage return gained or lost from intentional style biases within each asset class (e.g. value rather than core or 
overweight to emerging markets relative to benchmark). SS is the product of the actual manager allocation within each asset class multiplied by their 
specific benchmark, less TAA. 
Manager’s Skill (MS) – The percentage return gained or lost from manager value added relative to their specific benchmark. MS is the product of the 
actual manager allocation multiplied by their achieved excess return.
Total Fund Beta - Total Fund Beta is calculated using the S&P 500 as the benchmark. It represents a measure of the sensitivity of the total fund to 
movements in the S&P 500 and is a measure of the Total Fund's non-diversifiable or systematic risk.  
Tracking Error - A measure of the standard deviation of a portfolio's performance relative to the performance of an appropriate market benchmark.
Page 48
Glossary
Treynor Ratio - Similar to Sharpe ratio, but focuses on beta rather than excess risk (standard deviation). Treynor ratio represents the excess rate of 
return over the risk-free rate (i.e., ICE BofAML 3 Mo US T-Bill Index unless specified otherwise) divided by the beta. The result is the absolute rate of 
return per unit of risk. The higher the value, the better historical risk-adjusted performance.
Unit Value - The dollar value of a portfolio, assuming an initial nominal investment of $100, growing at the compounded rate of %Return for a given 
period.
Up Market Capture - Up market by definition is positive benchmark return and up market capture represents the ratio in % terms of the average 
portfolios return over the benchmark during the up market period. The higher the value of the up market capture the better the product's performance.
Yield to Maturity - The rate of return achieved on a bond or other fixed income security assuming the security is bought and held to maturity and that 
the coupon interest paid over the life of the bond will be reinvested at the same rate of return. The 30-Day SEC Yield is similar to the Yield to Maturity 
and is reported for mutual funds. 
Yield to Worst - The bond yield calculated by using the worst possible yield taking into consideration all call, put, and optional sink dates.

General Market Commentary
Equity markets posted positive returns in April as the S&P 500 (Cap Wtd) Index returned 12.82% and 
the MSCI EAFE (Net) Index returned 6.46%. Emerging markets returned 9.16% as measured by the 
MSCI EM (Net) Index.
The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index returned 1.78% in April, outperforming the 0.27% return by 
the Bloomberg US Treasury Intermediate Term Index. International fixed income markets returned 
1.51%, as measured by the FTSE Non-US World Gov't Bond Index.
Public real estate, as measured by the FTSE NAREIT Eq REITs Index (TR), returned 8.30% in April 
and 2.41% over the trailing five-year period.
The Cambridge US Private Equity Index returned 7.76% for the trailing one-year period and 11.68% for 
the trailing five-year period ending September 2019.
Absolute return strategies, as measured by the HFRI FOF Comp Index, returned 3.64% for the month 
and -2.92% over the trailing one-year period.
Due to a continued supply glut in crude oil, prices for oil with May delivery briefly dropped below zero for 
the first time in history as oil inventories approached capacity.  Prices plunged over 300% in one day, 
though prices stabilized as oil settled at $18.84 per barrel at the end of April.  
Global Equity markets recovered significant Q1 losses during April, as broad global equities returned 
roughly 11% during the month.  Stocks recovered on news of stronger-than-expected corporate 
earnings, increased optimism of countries and US states reopening segments of their economies, and 
in the US – additional monetary and fiscal stimulus to aid businesses and financial markets.
Amidst increased optimism, signs of economic and financial market challenges still persist.  In the US, it 
is estimated that 30.3 million Americans filed unemployment claims from the middle of March through 
the end of April as businesses have laid off or furloughed employees as companies struggle to make 
payrolls.  Unemployment and loss of income has predictably had a large negative impact on the 
economy at large as US GDP fell 4.8% during Q1 with economists predicting a further decline in Q2.

Asset Allocation Review 
City of Plano Retirement Security Plan
June 10, 2020
Introduction
Background:
RVK conducted an asset allocation review for the City of Plano Retirement Security Plan (“RSP”) to 
review the current target asset allocation with respect to the Plan’s objectives and RVK’s updated 
Capital Markets Assumptions. 
Investment Objective: The investment objective for RSP is to achieve an average annual rate of 
return equal to or greater than the annual rate of return of 6.75% for the aggregate investments 
over an evaluation period of three to five years or a full market cycle.
Risk/Return Profile: Capital Appreciation and growth.

Process Overview
Asset Allocation Study Overview
Introduction to Asset Allocation Studies:
Selecting an asset allocation is one of the most important investment decisions a fiduciary can make.
There are two steps to the asset allocation decision: 
1.
Identification of the asset classes to be considered 
2.
Selection of the portfolio mix that best meets plan objectives
Asset allocation studies help us to examine how well alternative investment strategies (i.e., differing asset 
allocations) address the objectives of a fund.

Illustrative Example
Capital Markets Assumptions
•
Each year, RVK reviews the capital market environment and updates our long-
term, forward-looking capital markets assumptions (“CMAs”) for each asset class 
used by our clients.
•
Annual updates are typically gradual and incorporate historical performance, 
current valuations, as well as the overall economic environment.
•
As a result of significant changes to interest rates, equity valuations and inflation 
expectations, we have updated our long-term forecasts as of Q1 2020.
•
The forecast horizon is for long-term periods over multiple market cycles, typically 
10 years or more.
•
The components we estimate include:
–
Return
–
Risk (volatility of returns)
–
Correlation (relationship of asset class returns with all other asset classes)
•
Return assumptions are generally index based and assume no investment 
manager alpha.
Page 5
What does it mean to get CM Assumptions “right”?
Relative accuracy is most important…
•
Relative Accuracy: Assumptions capture the relative relationships between 
asset classes – particularly closely related ones.
–
Having some assumptions that are spot on and others that are far off will 
produce unbalanced and poorly diversified portfolios. 
But “absolute” accuracy matters too—just not as much.
•
Absolute Accuracy: Assumptions reflect the absolute values actually 
experienced in future long-term market environments.
–
Having CM assumptions that are too high or too low across the board can cause 
a Fund to believe it can spend more than it can afford or restrict spending more 
than necessary.

Mean Variance Optimization (MVO) – Background
Using inputs of expected return, volatility, and correlation, MVO enables investors to identify 
combinations of distinct asset class allocations that maximize portfolio returns for a given level of 
risk. 
MVO Benefits
•
Introduces the critical concept of diversification, which encourages investors to avoid 
concentrating risk in a small subset of assets or asset classes, especially closely related (highly-
correlated) ones.
•
Focuses portfolio management activities on asset allocation, which is the most important driver 
of overall portfolio risk and return.
•
Provides a powerful quantitative tool to identify distinct asset allocation targets that have the 
most optimal risk/return tradeoffs.
MVO Shortcomings
•
Simplified assumption of risk/return trade-off fails to capture fully how real world investors 
weight gains versus losses (i.e., do losses matter more than gains?)
•
Volatility is viewed as the only proxy for risk.
•
Correlation is treated as static rather than dynamic.
•
Models are sometimes highly sensitive to small changes to input values (“robustness”).
•
Unconstrained output yields highly concentrated portfolios rather than the expected 
diversification.

Observations:
•
Portfolio is focused on growth (capital appreciation), with a moderate allocation to capital 
preservation (fixed income) and inflation hedging (core real estate) assets for diversification 
benefits. 
•
Maintains a strong base of stable, liquid assets to meet spending requirements.
•
The current asset allocation has a 46% probability of achieving 6.75% over a three-year 
horizon. 
•
RVK remains comfortable with the current allocation, but we note the US equity overweight 
relative to the global opportunity set. Please refer to Section III for more detail.

Monte Carlo Analysis:
•
Monte Carlo analysis simulates thousands of market scenarios (i.e. different asset returns, 
yields, growth and inflation assumptions), all via random sampling based on empirical market 
data.
•
Portfolios derived from our proprietary Capital Markets Assumptions are then modeled against 
these random economic scenarios to create a range of probable return outcomes given a 
specific asset allocation.

Plano Retirement Security Plan 
Investment Practices and Performance 
Review
Prepared by Randy Mitchell and Charles Hodge
2
Purpose & Scope
Purpose: Independent Review of the Investment Practices and Performance
Scope:
Identify and review existing investment policies, procedures, and practices.
Investment Policy Statement,
any informal procedures and practices
not necessary to review past policies, procedures, and practices that are no longer applicable.
Compare the existing policies and procedures to industry best practices.
Generally, assess whether the board, internal staff, and external consultants are adhering to the
established policies.
Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current policies, procedures, and practices and make
recommendations for improvement.

evaluation, including an explanation of any metrics used and associated calculations.
3
Introduction
The Texas Pension Review Board has provided guidance on the different areas required by
statute to be reviewed by independent consulting firms. Evaluations will vary based on
specific characteristics of each system’s size, governance and investments.
Milliman’s evaluation identified and reviewed the existing policies and procedures of the Plano
Retirement Security Plan (Plano RSP) as it relates to the oversight and management of the
Plan’s investments.  Our examination included a review of the Plano RSP’s Investment Policy
Statement and other documents related to the investment of plan assets as well as formal and
informal procedures adopted by Plano RSP management and staff.  We compared the Plano
RSP’s policies and procedures to industry best practices and assessed the likelihood the
board, internal staff and external consultants are adhering to the established policies.
Our evaluation also identified strengths and potential weaknesses of the current policies and
procedures and where appropriate we provided recommendations for improvements of any
deficiencies we identified.

5
Components of Evaluation
The investment policy statement is a manifestation of a disciplined process for selecting 
and monitoring the components in an investment program. It forms a foundation for a 
Plan’s investment strategy, formally establishes the governance structure and asset class 
representation, as well as defines the processes for investment manager selection and 
monitoring. 
Plano RSP has a written investment policy statement for the overall plan as
well as sub-asset classes. It is clearly customized for Plano RSP. The IPS is
reviewed periodically and updated as needed to reflect changes in
investment objective, policies and managers.
The Plan has engaged an independent Investment Consultant to review
asset allocations, investment policies and make recommendations to the
Board. The files reviewed demonstrate the evolution of targets and
expectations in the IPS based on the consultant’s and Board’s review.
The investment consultant for the Plano RSP, who is also a fiduciary,  is
independent of the managers and trading platforms utilized by the Plan.
Investment Policy Statement (IPS)
6
Components of Evaluation
Plano RSP has a formal Funding Policy incorporated within the IPS. The
funding policy integrates the actuarial valuation with plan assets and
provides a process for monitoring the Plan’s funding progress.
The IPS is written clearly allowing existing and newly appointed or elected
trustees to quickly understand its value as an ongoing tool for evaluating the
RSP’s investment program using consistent methods and best practices.
The Plano RSP Investment Policy Statement is consistent with other plans
and best practices.
Investment Policy Statement, cont.
7
Components of Evaluation
Plano RSP is well funded and has a formal asset
allocation policy defined within the IPS. It is specific in
terms of asset class, ranges around targets and evaluation
criteria.
Through the utilization of asset allocation studies, the
Investment Consultant makes recommendations to the
Board for approval.
In the asset allocation study, Plano RSP will consider new
asset classes and their contribution to increasing or
stabilizing return and it’s impact on Plano RSP’s overall
risk and standard deviation.
The Board examines the asset allocation quarterly and will
rebalance to targets based on IPS defined ranges.
Asset Allocation
8
Components of Evaluation
An asset allocation study is conducted
periodically (every 3-5 years),
incorporating current capital market
assumptions and the consultant’s
current views on the market.  As
reported in the most recent asset
allocation, the expectations used by the
RSP are in line with peers.
Plano RSP does not implement any
tactical asset allocation.
Plano RSP’s asset allocation is
appropriate for a plan their size and is
consistent with best practices.
Asset Allocation – Target Allocation
9
Components of Evaluation
Plano RSP has a target strategic allocation of
65% Equity, 10% Core Real Estate and 25%
Fixed Income.
Plano RSP’s expectations for risk examines
standard deviation and opportunities for
diversification.
Plano RSP is implementing it’s strategy using both
active and passive management
Plano RSP’s return and risk expectations used in
the asset allocation process are stress tested
under different scenarios as well as 5th and 95th
percentile measurements.

Components of Evaluation
The consultant develops return
expectations and they are reviewed

The inputs for the asset allocation
modeling are reasonable and the
approach used by the system to
develop the expected returns and asset
mix is disciplined and reviewed
regularly.
It is consistent with best practices, and
results in a well-diversified portfolio
appropriate for the plan’s size.
Asset Allocation – Expected Risk and Return
11
The IPS outlines the specific types of alternatives allowed including ranges and maximum
allocations.
Plano RSP’s only allocation to alternatives is 10% to Core Real Estate.  They use a collective
trust which provides quarterly liquidity with 45 days advance written notice.
Plano RSP’s alternative investments appropriate given its size and level of investment
expertise.
Components of Evaluation
Asset Allocation – Appropriateness of Alternatives and Liquid Assets
12
Components of Evaluation
The asset allocation study reflects the current plan covered 
population and expected cash flow needs.
Though the plan is experiencing slightly negative net cash flow due 
to larger benefit payments vs. current contributions, the lump-sums 
it offers are not significant and the population is stable and 
predictable. The volatility of plan distributions is predictable.
The Plano RSP asset allocation study examines multiple rolling and 
calendar year risk and return metrics and does not expect any 
stresses due to expected cash flows or liquidity needs. 
Plano RSP examines expected cash flows and cash balances each 
quarter and will rebalance the plan to target allocations to raise cash 
from investment managers when needed.
Plano RSP’s policy for future cash flow and liquidity needs is 
adequate for their plan’s size and consistent with best practices.
Asset Allocation – Future Cash Flow and Liquidity Needs
13

Accountability
17
Components of Evaluation
Investment manager guidelines are defined in the IPS. The guidelines outline investment 
objectives, benchmarks, allowable asset types, and expected returns, net of fees.
Investment managers are selected for investment by the RSP by reviewing search material 
developed and presented by the Investment Consultant. Typically, at least three prospective 
managers are reviewed and discussed for each manager search.
The board will meet with both current managers and potential managers for educational 
purposes and to ensure each manager is adhering to their stated objective.
Plano RSP reviews performance quarterly, examining both gross returns when the portfolio is 
managed gross (collective trust) and net returns compared to net universes for mutual funds.  
They also use index benchmarks which have no fees.
Managers can be placed on watch for different periods of time depending on the market 
environment for that manager’s asset class.  Typically the consultant makes recommendations 
for placing managers on watch and removing them from watch.

Closing Comments 
• 2019 market returns far exceeded expectations (20.01%).  
However, combined with 2018 (-5.81%), the two-year return 
fell below the previously expected 7.00% (6.32%). 
– There are $7.3M in deferred gains not recognized in the actuarial value 
of assets. 
– Funded ratio: 95.4% on AVA, 99.7% on MVA 
• The contribution rate of 3.90% of payroll is projected to 
decrease slightly to approximately 3.30% over the next 10 
years if all assumptions are met.  
– An illustrative example of a 0% market return for 2020 shows that the 
contribution rate would stay relatively level for the next two biennia, 
but increase to approximately 4.00% once all losses recognized.

Closing Comments (cont.)
• The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unknown.
– Market losses are possible in 2020. What is the subsequent future
outlook?
– How will it impact the City’s workforce?
– Will employee behavior (retirement, termination, etc.) have any
significant changes?
– Will there be a measureable difference in mortality rates?
