Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan Update 
Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan Update 
Connect Los Gatos is a public engagement initiative that promotes bicycle and pedestrian projects that 
are all part of a big picture effort to provide connected multi-modal routes through the Town. Since the 
adoption of the Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan (BPMP) in March 2017, the Town has made 
substantial progress in implementing the Plan’s priorities. The update reflects an important step in the 
assuring the Connect Los Gatos program’s long-term success.  
Purpose 
The goal of this BPMP update is to create a platform for the public, commissioners, and staff to use to 
gain an understanding of current, past, and future pedestrian and cyclist improvement projects. 
Updating the Town’s BPMP will better reflect the Connect Los Gatos Projects and ensure that there is 
consistency between the town’s current programs and the towns long range goals. It will also provide 
meaningful context to support future funding opportunities and decision making. The update will also 
introduce an online interactive map and updated project tables. 
Project Scope  
The scope of work includes: 
1.
A focused update to reflect the accomplishments and the Connect Los Gatos program
2.
Update Chapter 4, Network Recommendations and Project Prioritization
3.
Create an online interactive map to better illustrate project information and facilitate
community engagement
4.
Create a format that will allow staff to make timely updates about projects status, budget, and
funding.
