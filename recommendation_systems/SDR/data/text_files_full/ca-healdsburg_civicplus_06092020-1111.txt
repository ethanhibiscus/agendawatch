the State of California and the Sonoma County Health Official Orders No. C19- 03, C19-05, and 
C19-09, the City of Healdsburg Planning Commission meeting will not be physically open to the

How to Observe the Meetings
To maximize public safety while still maintaining transparency and public access, members of the 
public can observe the meeting by visiting http://healdsburgca.iqm2.com/Citizens/default.aspx. 
How to submit Public Comment
Members of public may provide public comment by emailing publiccomment@ci.healdsburg.ca.us. 
Comments may be submitted from the start of the Planning Commission meeting until the close of 
the public comment period on an agenda item. For example, public comments on Item 4A will be 
received from the point at which the Chair calls to order the Planning Commission meeting to the 
point at which he closes the comment period on item 4A. Comments received during the relevant 
time period will be read into the record, with a maximum allowance of 3 minutes per individual 
comment, subject to the Chair’s discretion. All comments should be a maximum of 500 words, 
which corresponds to approximately 3 minutes of speaking time. Any comment received outside of 
the comment period on that item, or outside of public comment on non-agendized items, including 
all comments received prior to the start of the meeting, will be included in the record of the meeting 
but will not be read into the record.

Planning@ci.healdsburg.ca.us or by calling 707-431-3346. The Planning Department will use their 
best efforts to provide reasonable accommodations to provide as much accessibility as possible

accommodation requests. All reasonable accommodations offered will be listed on the city website
