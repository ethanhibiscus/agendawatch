Chairman’s Report 
My report is very simple:

• The second item goes to the heart of whether LHRC will remain relevant as a Mayor’s 
committee or whether it should be disbanded? 
 
Old Business 
• Should Laconia Multicultural Festival – Next Year: Sept. 5th, 2020 be cancel? 
New Business 
• How do we respond to the cries for racial and social justice? 
• Other business
