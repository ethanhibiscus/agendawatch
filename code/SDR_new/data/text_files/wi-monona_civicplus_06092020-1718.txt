PARK & RECREATION BOARD (Agenda Item 5A) 
Meeting Date: June 9, 2020 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM: 
Additional Kayak/Canoe Rack at Winnequah Park/Healy Lane Parking Lot 
 
REQUESTED BY: 
Jake Anderson 
 
  
POLICY ANALYSIS STATEMENT: 
Parks & Recreation has received additional requests for more kayak/canoe racks in the city.  You can view the 
policies and fees at http://mymonona.com/324/Kayak-Canoe-Rack-Rentals  
Currently all of our racks are full with the exception of one rack at Grand Crossing Park that we have for daily 
use.  We have an older kayak rack available that we could place in Winnequah Park near the Healy Lane 
Parking lot.  The attached map is the location of where one would go.  This would be a temporary placement 
without a concrete pad in case we move forward with a construction project over the next couple of years.  If 
approved, we’re confident we would fill the rack and receive an additional $1,000 in revenue and provide a nice 
launch access to the channels leading out to Lake Monona.  There would be minimal expense to install this 
rack. 
 
 
 
 
 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
Additional $1,000 to the Recreation Budget revenue account for Canoe/Kayak Lease Revenue

PARK & RECREATION BOARD (Agenda Item 5B) 
Meeting Date: June 9, 2020 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM: 
Park Shelter Reservation Policies with Forward Dane Restrictions 
 
REQUESTED BY: 
Jake Anderson 
 
  
POLICY ANALYSIS STATEMENT: 
Due to Covid-19 and restrictions under the Forward Dane Plan 
https://publichealthmdc.com/documents/Forward_Dane.pdf 
Currently we have canceled our June reservations for park shelters.  Under the Forward Dane, park shelter 
rentals are considered mass gatherings and have the following restrictions: 
 
Phase 1 – No more than 50 people and must keep physical distancing of non-household members 
 
Phase 2 – No more than 100 people and must keep physical distancing of non-household members 
Phase 2 is also when playgrounds can reopen. 
 
Attached is an email from Public Health on best practices for gatherings/picnics for your review 
So, what this means is that you can have a park shelter rental but the picnic tables would need to be spaced 6’ 
apart 
 
Cleaning of restrooms and preparing shelters for rentals will take longer than in year’s past.  Currently we have 
plumbing issues at Dream Park, and only the Family bathroom will be available once we open that facility.  We 
do have bathrooms open now at Schluter, Lottes, & Ahuska. 
 
Director Anderson’s recommendation is the following 
Allow for shelter rentals on weekends only at Fireman’s Park & Ahuska Park. Summer camp will be utilizing 
Fireman’s Park Shelter during the week and we can control restroom use reasonably well.  Both facilities have 
large covered areas and plenty of green space around the facility. 
 
Not allow shelter rentals at Oneida (keep bathroom closed entire summer), no rentals at Dream Park due to 
social distancing challenges under shelter and historic use of families picnicking around the playground area, 
making it challenge to reserve off a spot.  Keep family bathroom open to public and advertise as a first come-
first serve. 
No rentals of Gazebo 
 
 
 
 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
$22,000 is budgeted for shelter rentals, we anticipated with modified rentals in July/August, we’re anticipating 
approximately $6,000 in rentals for the season if we adopt this approach.

Travel Self Monitoring Return to Work Policy - 5.8 Update (003).pdf
Hey all, 
 
Thanks everyone who was able to join the call today and for the lively conversation! Below are some notes from the call 
and some additional resources. Again, if you have any park questions next week, please reach out to Justin (cc’d).  
 
Data 
 
Keep an eye out for our data snapshot on our data page released on Monday.  
o Over the last several days, we have seen an increase in positive cases. The increase at this time is not 
due to opening up into phase 1, the increase of cases are from before 5/26. It is too early to tell if there 
is an increase from opening up since it has only been 4 days. Our current increase is likely due to higher 
testing capacity in Dane County.  
o To move to phase 2 more than half of metrics must be green and Epidemiology criteria ("percent 
positive tests" and "cases per day") must not be red. 
o In the month of May, so far we have seen 14% of the Dane County positive cases are asymptotic (I said 
16% on the call but received an update this afternoon that it is 14%). 
 
This is higher than we were previously seeing in Dane County.  
Forward Dane Requirements Page 
 
Continue to reference this page for resources and share this page with partners/programs that are looking to 
use your space. 
 
This is our key place to add resources for sectors and is constantly being updated. 
2
 
Reminder that anyone that is open and providing services in Dane County must have 4 polices: hygiene, 
cleaning, protective measures, and a training log. 
 
These policies are really in place to protect not only staff/community but also the business/program if 
something went wrong and a community member was trying to blame them. The program would be able to 
reference their policies to show they did what was necessary to best prevent the spread of COVID. 
 
From the plans that I have looked from you and your partners at most encompass the cleaning and protective 
measures. 
o Keep an eye out to make sure your plans also include a training plan and information from the hygiene 
policy (reference pg. 6 on what to do with a sick employee). 
Travel Restrictions for employees 
 
I am not able to specifically advise on what travel restrictions policies you should have for your employees but I 
can give you information on DHS recommendations and our Dane County employee policy to help inform your 
decision.  
o DHS recommends cancelling or postponing all travel, including travel within the state. If someone does 
travel, they have good travel tips on their travel page. I suggest you share the precautions they highlight 
with all employees that plan to travel.  
 
They recommend a 14 day quarantine for travel within Wisconsin and out of the state. 
o I attached Dane County employees’ travel restrictions from 5/8. This is the most current version of travel 
restrictions. This encompasses Public Health employees. I am sharing this as it is public record and 
already available for the community to access.  
 
There are no restrictions for county employees for travelling within Wisconsin. However, if a 
county employee travelled to a state with community spread, they would need to self-
quarantine for 14 days. 
Sports 
 
The sport FAQ highlights that equipment should be cleaned in between uses. This is a recommendation and not 
a requirement. If someone is playing catch, they do not need to clean the ball between throws, instead if they 
switch partners, we recommend cleaning or getting a new ball. 
 
There was a question in the chat that I didn’t get to about lacrosse and cricket.  
o Both games are not allowed as 6ft distancing does not occur during the typical game. Practices with 
distancing is okay. I will admit that I do not know a ton about cricket but my understanding of the game, 
it being similar to baseball, does not allow for distancing. Please email me if you disagree and I am 
happy to verify cricket by our legal team if you would like.  
 
On the call it was highlighted that there may be different levels of compliance in private vs public sectors. I get 
that this is frustrating and at every level of this process, I greatly value your commitment to reduce the risk of 
transmission of COVID. Throughout PHMDC’s whole COVID response, we have taken an education approach and 
follow-up with any complaints we receive with information and resources.   
Life Jackets 
 
I’ve had some questions about cleaning shared life jackets. If people can use their own life jackets with boat 
rentals, that would be ideal but understand that likely people will be renting life jackets. There isn’t official 
guidance from CDC or DHS about best practice. I wrote a cleaning plan below that you can use based on 
research from our internal Intelligence Team on best practices, The American Camp Association and information 
one of our local boat rental companies received from experts in Environmental Health. This plan has not been 
scientifically tested and cannot be guaranteed to limit all risk of COVID.  
o Wipe off or rinse visible dirt from the life jacket.  
o Hand wash life jacket in hot soapy water (make sure to clean buckles/straps).  
3
 
If desired, instead you can spray the life jacket with a Quaternary Ammonia disinfectant 
prepared for use according to label instructions with a minimum contact time of 5 minutes then 
rinse with water. 
o Use a dryer to ensure complete drying with a temperature set point not to exceed 140 °F (or allow to air 
dry).  
o Spray life jackets with alcohol-based disinfectant spray before use. 
o If cleaning is not an option, and you have enough life jackets, quarantine the life jacket for 72 hours 
between use. 
Shelter Reservations/Shared food 
 
Here are some pieces to consider communicating to folks that are continuing with shelter reservations (Sharing 
language from City of Madison that I reviewed last night): 
o Help keep park spaces safe and open during COVID-19 by practicing the following: 
 
Stay home if you are ill. 
 
Gatherings must be limited to no more than 50 people at one time. 
 
Maintain at least 6 feet between people outside of your household at all times. 
 
Bring your own disinfecting materials and hand soap/sanitizer. 
 
Do not share food or beverages. Avoid having a food buffet, serving food family style or a 
potluck. 
 
Do not leave trash behind! 
 
Consider wearing a face-covering. 
 
Avoid touching common touchpoints (tables and park equipment have not been sanitized). 
 
Avoid direct contact with others such as hugs and handshakes. 
 
Drinking fountains not available. 
Hand Dryer vs Paper Towels 
 
Timely question! I asked this to our internal Intelligence Team and someone else recently asked the same 
question so they already completed research around this. I pasted their guidance below. Heads up, it is a TON of 
information. I recommend at least reading the ‘response’ and ‘conclusion’ sections at the top. This is the last 
thing in the email so please disregard if it is not relevant to you! 
Response: 
To date, neither the WHO or CDC have released information specifically to discontinue the use of hand dryers.  Both 
organizations continue to promote good hand hygiene, giving the option of paper towels or hand dryers in publications. 
Data does not exist yet indicating that bathrooms are a place where the coronavirus spreads. 
 
Conclusion:  At this point there is not enough conclusive information out there to discontinue air dryer use.  I could not 
find any new studies since COVID-19 became a concern.  As mentioned, the risk is likely quite low in comparison to other 
main risk factors like direct contact.  Studies recommending paper towels vs. blowers, mostly mentioned hospitals or 
critical care facilities.   
Other recommendations include: 
 
Adding HEPA filters if not already installed 
 
Increasing surface cleaning frequencies in restrooms including countertops, walls near dryers, dryer units, door 
handles, etc. (to lessen the chance of someone picking from surface or or having it become aerosolized) 
 
Providing signage on how to properly wash hands to remove as much load as possible prior to drying step (ie. to 
make sure people are scrubbing effectively with soap).  Some studies showed that lingering germs could be 
blown off hands during air drying. 
 
World Health Organization 
4
The following graphic was released in the “Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth 
busters.”  Although the graphic was addressing the myth that dryers kill COVID, it advises people to dry hands using 
either paper towels or warm air dryers. 
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters 
 
 
 
CDC 
There is currently no specific guidance related to COVID-19 and hand dryers.  The website stresses the importance of 
keeping hands clean using the pandemic.  The last step to handwashing states the following:  “Dry your hands using a 
clean towel or air dry them.” 
https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html 
 
Air dryers in the news 
There have been a number of news articles questioning if hand dryers increase the spread of disease.  Concerns range 
from the possibility of the blowers to aerosolize particles that have settled and haven’t been wiped down to the 
possibility of aerosolized particles blowing farther out than normal with air dryers.  It seems that the jury is still out as 
the little research that has been done is inconsistent.  
There are many conflicting studies as to which hand drying method is most hygienic.  It is true that many of the studies 
available appear to be industry funded.  Additionally, since jet air dryers are somewhat new, they have not been widely 
tested against others.  
Examples of news articles: 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/hands-coronavirus-hot-air-dryer/2020/03/13/316cd6c8-649f-
11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html 
https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/verify/verify-are-hand-dryers-loaded-with-harmful-bacteria/65-537722784  
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/blowing-hard-2/ 
 
Xcelerator Dryers (Specific Brand which may or may not be applicable) 
https://www.exceldryer.com/hepa/ 
Due to COVID-19, the website is promoting units with HEPA filters.  Website states removal of 99.999% of viruses from 
the airstream (studied April 2020) 
This is an optional feature and can be retrofitted into existing units. 
A recent study looked at whether the hand dryers provide a reservoir of bacteria or simply blow large amounts of 
bacterially contaminated air.  The researchers attached HEPA filters to eliminate bacteria from the air passing through 
the dryer.  The quantity of bacteria in the dishes had fallen by 75%. Thus, the filters most likely reduce the risk or 
pathogens, but do not eliminate a risk entirely.   The chances of picking up a serious pathogen in a restroom is likely 
quite small in comparison to other risks such as person to person direct contact. 
 
Mayo Clinic Proceedings – The Hygienic Efficacy of Different Hand-Drying Methods: A Review of the Evidence 
5
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538484/ 
 
The goal of the Mayo Clinic literature review study, referenced in the email string, was to analyze the hygienic efficacy of 
different hand-drying methods and then recommend the best hand-drying option for health care professionals.  Here is 
a brief overview of the review. 
 
Reviewed 12 articles published from January 1970 through March 2011.  
 
Two inclusion criteria:  
o  Studies had to compare the hygiene performance of at least 2 hand-drying methods; studies solely 
focused on reporting the effectiveness of hand drying were excluded.  
o Studies had to use an empirical research approach with quantitative outcomes; qualitative and review 
articles were excluded.  
 
Hand-drying effectiveness was analyzed by:  
o speed of drying, 
o degree of dryness  
o effective removal of bacteria 
o prevention of cross-contamination 
 
Showed little agreement regarding the most hygienic method of hand drying.  
 
The results of different studies were conflicting. Some studies indicated that electric air dryers are of inferior 
effectiveness when it comes to the issue of hygiene, whereas others were of a firm opinion that they are a 
safe and effective means of hand drying. 
 
Most studies suggest that paper towels can dry hands efficiently, remove bacteria effectively, and cause less 
contamination of the washroom environment.  
 
Conclusion: From a hygiene viewpoint, paper towels should be recommended in locations where hygiene is 
paramount, such as hospitals and clinics. 
It appears that the study conclusion was due to (1) most studies showing that paper towels dry hand effectively, (2) 
remove bacteria effectively, and (3) may cause less contamination of the washroom environment. 
It is important to note that this recommendation was for hospital and clinic settings. 
This study did not look at other considerations such as sustainability or cost. 
 
For COVID concerns specifically, I reviewed the studies focusing on cross contamination concerns. (The background for 
many of these studies discusses how washrooms are at higher risk for bacteria transmission as toilet flushes generate a 
fine aerosol mist that can be sprayed into the air). As previously mentioned, the studies are limited and are 
conflicting.  Three studies showed hand dryers increasing cross contamination, while two showed no increase. 
 
Studies finding increased Cross-contamination 
Ngeow et al - August 1989 
Study comparing bacterial dispersal in hospital setting (hot air dryer vs. paper towels).  Dispersal of marker bacteria 
found 3 feet from air dryer vs. no dispersal when using paper towels.  Conclusion – hot air dryers unsuitable for use in 
critical patient care. 
Hanna et al – February 2011 
Hot air dryers resulted in a substantial number of airborne bacteria near the user, whereas paper and cloth towels 
produced negligible contamination of the surrounding environment. 
Fawdar - November 2008  
Jet air dryers were found to disperse hand contamination farther than paper towels and hot air dryers. 
 
Studies NOT finding increased Cross-contamination 
Taylor et al – December 2000 
The study found that air emitted from hot air dryers contained fewer microorganisms than air entering the dryer.  It also 
found that levels of microorganisms on external surfaces of hot air dryers were not different from those on other 
washroom surfaces. 
Natthews and Newsom – January 1987 
6
Study found no difference between aerosols liberated by paper towels and 2 models of hot air dryers, whereas the other 
2 models of hot air dryers generated fewer aerosols than paper towels. They concluded that hot air dryers were safe 
from a bacteriologic viewpoint.

PARK & RECREATION BOARD (Agenda Item 5C) 
Meeting Date: June 9, 2020 
 
 
AGENDA ITEM: 
Grand Crossing Park Policies 
 
REQUESTED BY: 
Jake Anderson 
 
  
POLICY ANALYSIS STATEMENT: 
As we start seeing more people visiting and using Grand Crossing Park, the following items and have come up 
and should be addressed/recommended by the Parks & Recreation Board 
 
Smoking – Do you want to ban smoking in the park? 
 
Dogs – We estimate about 30 dogs live in the Current units and the majority of the owners walk them daily 
through the park both on-leash and off-leash and use the green space for urinating and pooping.  As start 
programming in that area, and general use, should we restrict access to the green space by dogs.  We have an 
irrigation system that we are using to keep the grass as lush and thick as we can. 
 
Pier Use by Boaters – People are starting to dock up to our pier and using bathroom, or eating food.  Do we 
want to specify a time limit so park users can enjoy the pier with a boat docked up for an extended period of 
time.  We do anticipate starting to have dockside pickup for concessions/ice cream sales out of Below Deck, but 
would recommend a 10 minute time limit. 
 
Signage – Where and what type of signage should we have throughout the park?  We can look at signage on the 
poles welcoming people to the park, or a smaller version of the main entrance sign facing the water so boaters 
know it’s a city park?
