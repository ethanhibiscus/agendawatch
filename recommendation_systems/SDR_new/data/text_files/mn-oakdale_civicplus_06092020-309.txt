AGENDA MODIFICATION: Park Capital Improvement Program Review 
 
After brief discussion, the City Council concurred that the review of the Park Capital Improvement 
Program would be moved to the April 28 agenda. 
 
COVID-19 RESPONSE UPDATE 
 
Interim City Administrator Dawson stated that Governor Walz extended the emergency declaration to 
May 31 and the Stay at Home order to May 3. 
 
Public Works Director/City Engineer Bachmeier provided an overview of the tasks currently being 
performed by Public Works crews: street sweeping, patching, removing load limit signage, clearing trails, 
etc. 
 
Fire Chief Anderson noted that the department’s Personal Protective Equipment supplies were holding 
up. 
 
Council Member Ingebrigtson asked if information was available on the number of Oakdale residents 
who have tested positive for the virus. 
 
Fire Chief Anderson did not have access to that data but said the department receives notifications 
prior to going on calls for service. 
 
City Attorney Thomson added that he would need to confirm whether such data is private. 
WORKSHOP 
April 14, 2020

Police Chief Sullivan explained that officers responding to calls prepare for the potential of any medical 
issues and also that officers no longer accompany the EMT crews on calls. He added that call loads 
have been steady; patrolling of high traffic areas, such as grocery stores, has continued; and calls 
relating to social distancing have decreased.  Police Chief Sullivan further added that police are closely 
monitoring calls relating to domestic abuse. 
 
Administrative Services Director Petersen noted that her department has been tracking the City’s 
expenses relating to COVID and staff is being extra mindful of extra spending. She further noted that 
Washington County was considering extending the deadline for property tax payments, which would 
delay payment of the City’s portion by two-weeks. 
 
Council Member Zabel asked whether communities receive penalty fees and interest related to property 
tax payments and, if so, how those funds are factored into the City’s budget. 
 
Administrative Services Director Petersen explained that a small, prorated portion that the City receives 
is accounted for in the delinquent taxes part of the budget. 
 
In discussing the meeting schedule, the City Council concurred with returning to meeting two times a 
month rather than on a weekly basis. 
 
Council Member Zabel commented on special legislation being considered that would allow restaurants 
to temporarily sell unopened wine and beer along with food orders at curbside. He asked that the City 
be prepared to enact this provision, if approved by the Legislature. 
 
City Attorney Thomson indicated that he would review the legislation to determine if the City would need 
to make any modifications to allow the curbside sales of wine and beer. 
 
Police Chief Sullivan noted that liquor stores in the City are being allowed to offer curbside pick-up. 
 
Community Development Director Streetar informed the City Council that activity in his department has 
remained steady. 
 
PROVIDING SANITARY SEWER TO LAKE ELMO 
 
Public Works Director/City Engineer Bachmeier provided an overview of a request from the City of Lake 
Elmo for Oakdale to provide sanitary sewer service to a 180-acre site, located east of Ideal Avenue and 
north/south of CSAH 14, recently acquired by Lake Elmo.  He added that the site zoning was comprised 
of commercial, industrial, residential, and open space.  Public Works Director/City Engineer Bachmeier 
further added that Lake Elmo currently lacks the capacity to extend sanitary sewer service to the site; 
whereas, Oakdale does have the capacity. He spoke about the potential of partnering with Lake Elmo to 
relocate and update Oakdale’s lift station with Lake Elmo covering costs relating to the preparation of 
an impact and capacity study and a rate study, and to require Lake Elmo’s support of Washington 
County’s upgrading of CR 13 (Ideal Avenue). 
 
Mayor Reinke commented on working with Lake Elmo to ensure complementary uses along the cities 
borders in the vicinity of this site. 
WORKSHOP 
April 11, 2020 
Page Three 
 
 
In response to a question from Council Member Zabel, Council Members Ingebrigtson and Swedberg 
supported the concept being proposed but would need definitive data before taking action to approve 
the proposal. 
 
Council Member Zabel asked that details be provided on the City’s return on the investment and 
revenue as well as costs that Oakdale would take on should Lake Elmo build a lift station to serve the 
site at some point in the future. 
 
Council Member Ingebrigtson expressed concern with industrial development occurring at that location.  
 
Council Member Olson agreed. 
 
PUBLIC WORKS FACILITY SITE PLANNING 
 
Public Works Director/City Engineer Bachmeier provided an update of the proposed site for the new 
public works campus, located at 32nd Street and Granada Avenue, on land donated by 3M.  He noted 
that as the project would be a Brownfield Site redevelopment project, 3M needs the City to provide a 
site plan showing the placement of the public works buildings at that location.  Public Works 
Director/City Engineer Bachmeier explained the process for correcting soils on the site and addressing 
contaminants. He added that the Public Works staff has expressed concerns about contaminants at the 
site as well as the proximity to the Hubbard Broadcasting satellite.   
 
Public Works Director/City Engineer Bachmeier commented on another potential site for the Public 
Works campus, the Dale property south of LA Fitness.  He noted that the cost for the site would be $3.5 
million for 15 acres, a portion of which could be sold off.   
 
Public Works Director/City Engineer Bachmeier asked for input on the three sites: 
 
1. 
Rebuild at Current Location (1900 Hadley): Would require filling portion of wetland and 
mitigating two acres at another location in the City. 
2. 
Dale Site (South of LA Fitness): Difficult access. Use not consistent with PUD for the area. 
3. 
3M Site (32nd and Granada). 
 
In response to a question from Council Member Swedberg, Public Works Director/City Engineer 
Bachmeier noted that Public Works staff met with an MPCA representative to learn more about 
Brownfield redevelopment projects and also that an earlier report showed there would be very little 
exposure from the satellite on the adjacent parcel.   
 
Council Member Swedberg spoke to the importance of the Public Works staff being comfortable with 
the site selected. 
 
Public Works Director/City Engineer Bachmeier described the two standards for cleaning up sites: 
industrial and residential and that he would ask 3M to use the residential option rather than industrial, 
which would include some additional steps. 
 
Council Member Zabel commented on the long-term existence and success of Brownfield projects. 
WORKSHOP 
April 11, 2020 
Page Four 
 
 
In response to a question from Council Member Olson, Council Member Zabel recalled that the testing 
of Brownfield sites continue as long as the site is in use as developed. 
 
Council Member Olson talked about the importance of clearly communicating to the community why a 
contaminated site is being developed by the City.   
 
Council Member Zabel suggested the potential of holding an open house. 
 
Council Member Swedberg agreed.  She added that of the other sites, the existing site would not 
provide the space needed. 
 
Mayor Reinke noted that of the other sites, he would take the Dale property off the table due to cost, 
access issues, and zoning conflicts. 
 
Council Member Zabel added that the Dale site would also take 10 acres of prime development 
property away. 
 
Council Member Ingebrigtson talked about the importance of finding a balance between the emotional 
data and scientific data and that the experts are not seeing a scenario where there would be a concern 
with developing the site. Because of the lack of options for a site for the public works campus, he 
mentioned the possibility of building east of Target, on Lake Elmo property. 
 
In response to a suggestion of building on the New Vision (Carmike Theater) site, Mayor Reinke stated 
that the purchase price would be deterrent. 
 
Community Development Director Streetar provided a brief overview of the redevelopment plans being 
considered for the New Vision site. 
 
Council Member Swedberg supported developing the 3M site to residential standards. 
 
Council Member Olson stated that her utmost concern is the safety of those who will work at that 
location and for the community. 
 
Staff was directed to proceed with the 3M property option and planning an open house to discuss the 
proposal. 
 
SUMMERFEST 
 
Communications Specialist MacLeod reviewed community events that had been canceled in the metro 
area and asked for direction on whether to cancel Summerfest, set for June 25 to 28.  She noted that 
no funds had yet been spent on the fireworks show or carnival; that tent rental costs could be carried 
over to 2021; and that deposits made for entertainment may not be refundable. 
 
Council Member Ingebrigtson supported canceling Summerfest due to social distancing concerns. 
 
Council Member Swedberg agreed. 
WORKSHOP 
April 11, 2020 
Page Five 
 
 
Council Member Zabel inquired whether a decision on the fireworks could be made at a later date and 
commented on the potential of moving the fireworks to July 4. 
 
After further discussion, the Summerfest Committee was directed to cancel the 2020 Summerfest 
Celebration. 
 
COMMUNITY SURVEY 
 
Communications Specialist MacLeod provided an overview of the community survey being distributed 
May 15 and noted that it would include a POLCO component to allow for a more in-depth answer to a 
specified question. 
 
In response to an inquiry from Communications Specialist MacLeod, the City Council did not want any of 
the proposed questions removed and supported the two additional questions relating to information 
sources and Summerfest, provided on space availability.   
 
Council Member Zabel suggested a question relating to favorite park amenity. 
 
Council Member Swedberg recommended using POLCO for the favorite park amenity question. 
 
Council Member Olson agreed. 
 
Council Member Swedberg inquired whether the City should hold off on sending out the survey until the 
end of July, early August due to the COVID situation. 
 
Communications Specialist MacLeod did not think that COVID would have a bearing on the questions 
being asked. 
 
Council Member Zabel supported proceeding with the survey in May as planned. 
 
Mayor Reinke agreed. 
 
Council Member Olson preferred to wait on the survey but supported proceeding in May. 
 
FOOD SHELF FUNDING 
 
Interim City Administrator Dawson followed up on the request from the Special City Council meeting 
held April 7 to provide funds to the Christian Cupboard Emergency Food Shelf (CCEFS) due to the 
significant increase in users relating to the COVID pandemic.  He explained that a statute identified by 
City Attorney Thomson allows cities to give money to local food shelves serving the community.  Interim 
City Administrator Dawson identified funding sources as the charitable gambling fund or forfeiture fund. 
 
Referencing forfeiture funds, Police Chief Sullivan explained how a donation could be accomplished 
using Police Department general funds and replenishing the fund with forfeiture funds.   
 
 
WORKSHOP 
April 11, 2020 
Page Six 
 
 
Council Member Zabel strongly supported assisting CCEFS and utilizing monies from the charitable 
gambling fund as forfeiture funds were earmarked for the police expansion project. He recommended a 
donation of $10,000.  
 
Police Chief Sullivan explained that city councils may not direct the use of forfeiture funds. 
 
Administrative Services Director Petersen commented that some monies from the Charitable Gambling 
Fund proceeds would be needed to address a deficit in the Summerfest fund from 2019. 
 
Interim City Administrator Dawson suggested a donation cap of $20,000 for the current and any future 
requests from local food shelves. 
 
Staff was directed to developing a policy to provide the framework for donating to non-profits on a short-
term basis and bring for review by the City Council on April 28. 
 
Staff was directed to provide $12,000 from the Charitable Gambling Fund to CCEFS, following receipt of 
a written request from the organization. 
 
ADJOURNMENT 
 
The work session adjourned at 6:40 PM. 
 
 
Respectfully submitted,

EMERGENCY MEETING 
Minutes 
OAKDALE CITY COUNCIL 
SATURDAY, MAY 30, 2020 
Mayor Paul Reinke called for an emergency meeting of the City Council to be held in City Hall at 1:00 p.m. 
Saturday, May 30, 2020. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the possibility of instituting a curfew 
in the City of Oakdale for public safety in light of widespread public violence after the death of a resident in 
an encounter with police officers of the City of Minneapolis. 
The meeting was called to order at 1:00 by Mayor Reinke.

7th Street N 
CONSIDERATION OF INSTITUTING A CURFEW WITHIN THE CITY 
Mayor Reinke opened the discussion by noting that the Governor had declared curfews in the cities of 
Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and that several metropolitan cities had instituted their own curfews. The 
purpose of this meeting was to discuss whether and under what terms a curfew might be instituted in 
Oakdale. 
Police Chief Sullivan debriefed the Council about how events had unfolded in Oakdale since Tuesday, May 
26, and provided a current assessment of conditions in the City. He related that all law enforcement 
executives in the area did not favor instituting curfews, and provided his own rationale for strongly 
recommending that the City Council not institute a curfew in Oakdale. He noted that curfews are 
appropriate for prolonged events, and stated this was not the case at the present time. 
Mayor Reinke facilitated discussion among the Councilmembers, and each indicated their reasons for 
concluding that a curfew would not be appropriate at this time. Mayor Reinke asked the residents present 
regarding their views of the matter, and each said he/she came to the meeting to urge the Council not to 
have a curfew. Mr. Wentz complimented the Oakdale Police staff on its response to the situation. 
At the conclusion of discussion, the Council agreed that there was no need to take action on this matter 
(i.e., to institute a curfew). Mayor Reinke said he would contact Councilmembers and Messrs. Sullivan and 
Dawson on Sunday to determine whether there would be a need to call an emergency meeting to 
reconsider this matter. 
ADJOURNMENT: Councilmember Zabel moved, and Councilmember Swedberg seconded, to adjourn the 
meeting at 1:52 p.m. Motion passed, 5 - 0. 
Respectfully submitted,

Title: Authorize Agreement with MBRB (Metro Bowhunters Resource Base) for 2020 hunt. 
BACKGROUND 
Over the years, the City has been receiving complaints regarding the growing deer population in several 
neighborhoods within the community. The primary homeowner complaint involves the damage caused by deer 
destroying gardens, yards, and landscaping areas. 
The initial response of the City involved educating residents who may be enticing deer into the neighborhood. This 
approach didn’t appear to be effective as some parties continue to put out food or salt blocks. As such, over the 
last 16 years, the City has contracted with a bow-hunting group to control the deer population. The arrangement 
has been effective in that 214 deer have been harvested since the City began the hunts; while at the same time 
there have been no claims of property damage or injury. 
It would therefore be appropriate for the Council to consider renewing the agreement with an entity that controls 
deer populations through restricted hunts. 
The overall objective is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by controlling the deer population to: 
• 
Reduce damage to private property 
• 
Reduce the occurrence of vehicle accidents with deer 
• 
Reduce the likelihood of contracting Lyme disease through deer ticks 
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
There is no cost associated with the program, other than those associated with preparing the parking permits for 
the hunters to post on their dashboards. 
STAFF AND/OR BOARD/COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION 
It is recommended the deer population be controlled by authorizing an exclusive deer hunt with the Metro 
Bowhunters Resource Base (MBRB), subject to the following conditions: 
1. Compliance with Special Archery Deer Hunt Rules (attached). 
2. Exemption from Oakdale City Code Section 12-19 (parking restrictions); Section 13-06 (unlawful discharge 
of a weapon) and Section 13-15 (target ranges). 
The sites identified on the attached map were developed through a combination of researching where there have 
been deer/vehicle accidents, where property owners have requested assistance in controlling the deer populations 
on their property, and where the City Council has approved hunting in previous years. 
CITY COUNCIL ACTION REQUESTED 
It is recommended the Council waive reading and adopt Resolution 2020-xxx, Authorizing the agreement and 
exemptions to Section 12-19(a) (Parking Restrictions)  and Section 13-6 (a) and 13-15 (a-e) (Weapons- unlawful 
discharge and Target Ranges) with MBRB.

□ 
BACKGROUND 
Throughout this year, City Council has discussed several items relating to IT services as Metro-lNET 
begins a transition from a City of Roseville department to a standalone Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) 
entity. After a preliminary review of alternate services, Council expressed a desire to have an 
independent entity complete a full review of IT services that would examine both current service needs 
as well as future plans and associated requirements. Staff recommends engaging Hallmentum for 
these services. 
Hallmentum is owned by Jim Hall, an innovative senior IT leader with over 20 years' experience in IT 
leadership including more than eight years at the Chief Information Officer level in both government and 
higher education institutions. His plan to address Oakdale's request is attached. Highlights include: 
• 
A review of current departmental and system operations 
• 
Interviews with City staff to determine anticipated needs 
• 
Interviews with several vendors to identify which may be able to meet current and future IT 
requirements 
• 
Synthesis of those interviews, and recommendations on modernization opportunities and 
alignment with City goals. 
This project could be completed in approximately 8-10 weeks and is estimated to cost approximately 
$11,000, which will be paid out of the Communications and Broadcasting Fund. 
STAFF AND/OR BOARD/COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION 
Staff recommends the City Council approve the proposal for research and recommendation of IT 
services from Hallmentum.

OVERVIEW 
City of Oakdale currently uses City of Roseville’s Metro I-Net collaborative. Roseville plans to move to an 
independent JPA in late 2020 or early 2021, and the City of Oakdale would like to understand their 
options and investigate alternatives. 
City of Oakdale has done some investigation into LOGIS, Ricoh ITS, Marco, and Loffler, but would like to 
bring in a third party to examine the field, understand options, and present recommendations. 
Jim Hall of Hallmentum presents this proposal for a research and recommendation effort. 
Hiring an outside consultant leverages experienced talent to help City of Oakdale to reimagine how 
technology can benefit the organization, such as: 
● Fresh perspective on IT strategy 
● Not tied to current vendors 
● Generate new technology models where needed 
● Apply technical knowledge and strategic planning 
Consulting services provide greater flexibility. By hiring a consultant, City of Oakdale can adjust time up 
or down as needed during the assignment.

 ​  
​  
 
APPROACH 
Hallmentum recommends the research and recommendation effort be broken up into these phases: 
1. REVIEW - CITY OF OAKDALE 
The first phase will focus on information gathering on City of Oakdale. Will work with identified 
leadership, team members, and partners to gather the Current State about how City of Oakdale 
leverages the Roseville Metro I-Net. To include services, technology, contracts, vendors, organization, 
and other relationships. 
2. INTERVIEWS - CITY OF OAKDALE 
This phase will start concurrently with information gathering, and will include meeting with key 
stakeholders to understand not just how City of Oakdale currently uses Metro I-Net, but future plans and 
needs for City of Oakdale. These discussions will seek to uncover how technology can play a strategic 
role in delivering on those future plans. This understanding is essential for examining vendors. 
Initial discovery will also look for any gaps in service from Roseville Metro I-Net and City of Oakdale’s 
needs, including IT security, IT operations, IT management, and IT infrastructure. 
Stakeholders during this phase will include all departments in the City of Oakdale. 
3. RESEARCH - VENDORS 
The vendor research phase is expected to be very short, and will run concurrently with starting vendor 
interviews. City of Oakdale has already done some in-house investigation of LOGIS, Ricoh ITS, Marco, 
and Loffler. The vendor research phase will identify other potential vendors in this space (Nology 
Networks and others). 
4. INTERVIEWS - VENDORS 
Interviews with vendors will require the most time in this project. Throughout this phase, I will schedule 
meetings with vendors to review service offerings, value propositions, support levels, future expansion 
plans, costs, and other factors that may benefit City of Oakdale. 
This information gathering phase will also include discussions with Roseville Metro I-Net to understand 
the services they currently provide, and the services that are planned after the JPA. 
May require more than one interview with some vendors, as new options are uncovered during 
interviews, and paths are analyzed. See 5. Synthesis.

5. SYNTHESIS 
The synthesis phase will run in parallel with the vendor interview phase, and represents analysis of the 
vendor interviews. Throughout the vendor interviews, I will generally use an “Open - Focus - Options ­
Narrow - Close” approach, where all options can go “on the table,” then narrowed to focus on those 
options that apply best to City of Oakdale. 
I will plan to schedule follow-up interviews with some vendors to better understand the most interesting 
options and how they can apply to meet City of Oakdale’s needs. These options will then be narrowed to 
identify the top (three to five) most valuable or most likely paths for City of Oakdale. 
Analysis will also include what City of Oakdale needs are and are not being met, and how to best 
leverage services that can be provided by each vendor. Also to include what technology and services are 
provided by the City of Oakdale itself, versus what services and technology can be or should be 
outsourced elsewhere. 
Stakeholders during Synthesis will include City of Oakdale Administrative Services, and Planning. 
6. DOCUMENTATION 
After information gathering and synthesis, will document the findings and recommendations into an 
actionable report. The part of the project will capture the strategic options to generate a focused 
technology outsourcing strategy. The strategy will likely address: 
● Future positioning of support options 
● Future technology landscape 
● Modernization 
● Alignment

The final report will also identify: 
Essential needs: 
Any high-priority risks and items that may have been identified during information gathering 
and discovery. 
Structural needs: 
Issues that address the relationship between City of Oakdale and technology support vendors. 
Resource needs: 
Budgets and technology replacement strategies. 
Organizational support: 
Recommendations that support City of Oakdale functions. 
Strategic positioning: 
Items that address future needs and upcoming/planned functions of City of Oakdale. 
Top recommendations: 
To identify the top (three to five) most valuable or most likely vendors or paths for the City of 
Oakdale. 
During the documentation phase, I will coordinate with the City of Oakdale to discuss the progress of the 
report and review options. Comments during this phase will be used to update the document. 
Stakeholder during the documentation and review phases will be City of Oakdale Administrative 
Services Director. 
7. DELIVERY 
Delivery of recommendations will be to the City of Oakdale Administrative Services Director. 
At your option, review of recommendations may include meeting with the City of Oakdale city council. 
The City of Oakdale calendar shows regular council meetings every other week, with a schedule change 
in the first week of July. Depending on schedules, the review with the city council could occur during the 
city council workshop on August 10.

Title:  Temporary Drive-in Cinema Permit 
BACKGROUND 
Marcus Theater (5677 Hadley Ave N) requests to use a portion of their parking as a drive-in cinema. 
Sound would be directed to customer’s automobiles via a low power FM transmitter. This request is in 
response to the continued closure of movie theaters and other entertainment venues due to the COVID­
19 pandemic. The ability to operate temporarily as a drive-in cinema would allow Marcus Theater to 
resume some business operations while also facilitating proper social distancing. 
Currently, the Zoning Ordinance or City Code does not explicitly address this type of use. However, on May 
26, 2020, the City Council approved a Business Recovery Assistance program that included several 
temporary measures to assist local businesses in recovering from the effects of the pandemic. The 
Council could build on the business assistance program by creating a temporary drive-in cinema permit 
that would allow for the operation of a drive-in cinema under certain conditions. 
STAFF AND/OR COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION 
Staff recommends the City Council authorize a temporary drive-in cinema permit subject to the following 
conditions: 
1. The permit applies to existing parking lots of existing theatres only. 
2. A drive-in will not create a nuisance condition as defined by City Code. 
3. A drive will not serve alcohol. 
4. A drive-in shall have a COVID-19 Preparedness Plan as outlined in the Governor’s Executive Order 
20-56. 
5. The term of the permit shall be temporary, beginning on 10 June 2020 and ending no later than 
30 September 2020 unless the City Council extends or terminates the permit. 
6. Review and issuance of the permit shall be administrative. 
7. The city waives the permit fee. 
CITY COUNCIL ACTION REQUESTED 
It is requested that the City Council authorize a temporary drive-in cinema permit to Marcus Theater, 
5677 Hadley Avenue, subject to conditions.

Title: Approval of Cooperative Construction and Agreement with Washington County 
Regarding the Landscaping Costs at Hadley Avenue North/County State Aid Highway 
(CSAH) 13 at Trunk Highway (T.H.) 36. 
BACKGROUND 
Washington County worked jointly with the City of Oakdale and MnDOT for the construction of an interchange at 
the Hadley Avenue and MN Hwy 36 intersection over the past five years; City Project 2017-02. The project 
improvements included a new bridge, interchange ramps, Gateway Trail grade separation/pedestrian 
enhancements, and relocation of the north frontage road. These improvements have been completed. The 
County constructs/bids landscaping separately from the bridge/roadway improvements due to warranty issues, 
and may combine this project with other landscaping projects to improve the contractor selection and 
competitive bidding process. 
It would be appropriate for the Council to consider approving the landscaping construction plan and agreement 
with Washington County that is associated with this project. 
STAFF AND/OR BOARD/COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION 
Staff recommends approving the attached plan and entering into the Cooperative Construction Agreement 
between Washington County and the City of Oakdale relating to the construction cost responsibilities to the 
landscaping on CSAH 13/Hadley Avenue North at T.H. 36. This is a gateway to the Oakdale community so the 
landscaping is an opportunity to create a good first impression of the City of Oakdale. The plan has been 
prepared consistent with: the original budget that was established, and uses materials/plants/trees similar to 
those at our other community gateway along 10th Street between Hadley and I-694. 
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS 
The City desires to use MnDOT funds and State Aid for these improvements.

The County and City shall be responsible for the construction administration, inspection, and for the 
observation and testing for all construction items. 
F. COST PARTICIPATION ITEMS AND ESTIMATED COSTS 
The City hereby agrees to be bound to the cost participation provisions in the “Washington County Cost 
Participation Policy #8001 for Cooperative Highway Improvement Projects”, which is incorporated into this 
agreement by reference. The City’s cost participation is set forth in Table 1 and is broken down into five 
categories which are: 1) Construction; 2) Design Engineering; 3) Construction Engineering/Contract 
Administration; 4) Right of Way; and 5) County-Furnished Material. 
1. Construction 
Construction costs shall be the cost to construct the Project. The County has prepared a statement of 
estimated quantities and cost splits hereto attached as Exhibit B. The City shall pay to the County its 
share of the total cost as shown in Exhibit B and set forth in Table 1. After the County has awarded the 
construction contract, Exhibit B will be updated to reflect the actual contractor’s unit prices. 
2. Design Engineering 
Design engineering costs shall be professional design engineering services, project coordination, 
preparation of plans and specification, stakeholder engagement, geotechnical studies, and other 
administrative functions necessary for the Project. Based on the City’s share of the construction cost, 
the City shall pay the prorated cost of design engineering for the entire Project as set forth in Table 1. 
After the County has awarded the construction contract, Exhibit B will be updated to reflect the actual 
design engineering cost. 
3. Construction Engineering/Contract Administration 
Construction engineering/contract administration costs shall be construction observation, construction 
testing, construction administration, staking, conducting and recording the pre-bid, pre-construction 
and weekly construction meetings, reviewing monthly pay estimates, labor compliance, and other 
administrative functions necessary for the Project. Construction engineering/contract administration is 
8% of the construction cost. The City shall pay 8% of the City’s share of the construction cost for 
construction engineering/contract administration as set forth in Table 1. After the County has awarded 
the construction contract, Exhibit B will be updated to reflect the estimated construction 
engineering/contract administration cost. 
4. Right of Way 
Right of Way costs shall be permanent right-of-way, permanent utility and/or drainage easements, 
temporary easements, title work costs, appraisal costs, relocation specialist costs, relocation costs, and 
condemnation commissioner costs. If applicable, the City shall pay their share of the final right of way 
cost. The estimated amount is set forth in Table 1. 
5. County-Furnished Material 
County-furnished material costs shall be items such as light poles, traffic signal control equipment, and 
street name signs which are separately procured outside of the construction contract and installed 
within the Project limits. The City shall pay their share of the final County-furnished material cost. The 
estimated amount is set forth in Table 1.

6. The costs and shares attributable to the City and payable to the County as shown in Table 1 are merely 
estimated and a final reconciliation of costs as set forth in Section G below shall be done at the end of 
the Project. Actual City costs and shares are based on the following: 
a. Construction shall be based on the contractor's unit prices and final quantities at Project 
completion including all contract changes. 
b. Design engineering shall be based on the contractor’s unit prices at the time of contract award. 
c. Construction engineering/contract administration shall be based on the contractor’s unit prices 
and final quantities at Project completion including all contract changes and liquidated damages. 
d. Right of way shall be based on the final costs to acquire right of way. 
e. County-furnished material shall be based on the final costs to acquire County-furnished 
material. 
G. PAYMENT 
1. Construction and Construction Engineering/Contract Administration 
a. After the County has awarded the construction contract, the County shall update Exhibit B to 
conform the Exhibit to the amounts in the awarded bid and shall invoice the City 10 percent of the 
City's estimated construction and construction engineering/contract administration cost based on 
the updated Exhibit B. 
b. During construction, the County shall submit to the City partial estimates of work performed by the 
contractor. The City shall pay to the County its share of the partial estimate as determined in Section 
F. 
c. Upon substantial completion of the work the County shall submit to the City a final invoice and final 
reconciliation of costs. The reconciliation will add or subtract contract amendments to the City’s 
Project components, adjustments for liquidated damages pursuant to Section I., and previous 
Project cost payments made by the City to the County. 
2. The costs set forth in Table 1 for design engineering and right of way shall be separate line items on the 
invoice and paid by the City on a reimbursable basis. 
3. In the event that the City paid more in advance than the actual cost of the City’s portion of the Project, 
the County shall refund without interest the amount to the City. 
4. The City shall pay 100 percent of an invoice amount within thirty (30) days of receipt. 
H. CONTRACT CHANGES 
Any modifications or additions to the final approved plans and/or specifications of the Project shall be made 
part of the construction contract through a written amendment to the construction contract and the cost 
for such changes shall be appropriated as set forth in Section F. of this Agreement.
