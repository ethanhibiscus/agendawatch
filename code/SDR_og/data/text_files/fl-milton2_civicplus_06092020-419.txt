WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that City Employees should no longer test
the backflow devices for commercial customers; and
WHEREAS, the City Council currently requires that City Employees test and charge
commercial customers a fee for backflow testing on their properties;
WHEREAS, the City Council understands it is not the common practice of City Employees
in similarly situated municipalities to provide such testing and certification;
NOW THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF MILTON, FLORIDA
PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS TO ITS CODE OF ORDINANCES
RELATED TO THE TESTING AND CERTIFICATION OF THE BACKFLOW DEVICES OF
ITS COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS:
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF MILTON, FLORIDA;
Section 1: That Chapter 48, Utilities, Article III, Cross Connections, Section 183 of the
Code of Ordinances of the City of Milton, is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 48-183. - City authority to require installation of approved backflow device;
installation at customer's expense; termination of service for noncompliance; notice; testing and
retesting.
a)
The city is responsible for the protection of its public potable water distribution
system from backflow of contaminants or pollutants through any water service connection. If, in
the judgment of the department, an approved backflow prevention device is required at the water
service connection to any of its customer's premises for the safety of the users of the water system,
the department shall give notice in writing to the customer that an approved backflow prevention
device shall be installed at the customer's expense, if this customer is a commercial customer or
residential customer with a pool and/or has an auxiliary water supply.
b)
Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to meet the department's
time schedule for the installation of such device shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of
water service until such device has been properly installed. Any licensed plumber may install the
proper device in the correct manner.
Council 6.9.2020 4 of 37
c)
Compliance testing after the initial installation and regularly scheduled
maintenance tests shall be performed by a licensed backflow tester with active license at the

an active license.
e)
If any known or suspected accidental pollution or contamination of the consumer’s
or the department’s potable water system occurs, the consumer shall promptly take steps to confine
any further spread of pollution or contamination and shall immediately notify the department of
the situation.
Section 2: That Chapter 48, Utilities, Article III, Cross Connections, Section 188 of the
Code of Ordinances of the City of Milton, is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 48-188. – Routine testing and maintenance; repairs at customer’s expense; bypassing
backflow device prohibited.
a)
Routine testing of backflow prevention devices shall be the owner’s responsibility to have
a licensed backflow tester to perform the test and supply the City with a copy of the backflow test
and a license. The frequency of testing will be dependent upon the type of device installed and the
potential health hazard involved.
b)
Customers will be notified 30 days in advance of the date that testing will need to be
performed. If the customer's operations cannot permit an interruption of service, it will be the
customer's responsibility to have two approved backflow prevention devices installed in parallel
so that one may be used while the other is being tested. Bypasses around backflow prevention
devices are expressly forbidden.
c)
If any devices tested are found to be faulty, the customer must have it repaired and supply
the City with a passing test within the 30 day period.
d)

pools and/or auxiliary water supplies to maintain all backflow preventers and vacuum breakers
within the building or on the premises in good working order and to make no piping or other
arrangements for the purpose of bypassing any backflow device or vacuum breaker. Bypassing of
any backflow device or vacuum breaker is expressly forbidden.
Section 3: Severability.

Title: Development Agreement
Background: Splash RV Resort is the physical development process. The
property is found at 8500 Welcome Church Rd. The owner
has asked the city of Milton to provide sewer and gas
service to the subject property. The property is not within
our corporate limits and as such is not subject to our
regulatory standards. It has however completed the
approval process through Santa Rosa County and the state
(see attached location map and applicant information). For
more information on the project please visit
https://www.splashrvresort.com/
Summary: Attached hereto, you will find a proposed Developer
Agreement. Similar to a development agreement it is a
voluntary contract between a local jurisdiction and a person
who owns or controls property detailing the obligations of
both parties and specifying the standards and conditions
that will govern development or in this case the extension
of public utilities. This is not truly a development
agreement but rather a developer agreement. Although the
agreements are voluntary, once made they are binding on
the parties and their successors.
Council 6.9.2020 8 of 37
The developer agreement provides information to the
developer that the development fee or fees that apply may
change during the term of the agreement. Additionally,
clarification about project phasing and timing of payment
of fees is described.
Recommendation: Legal review is complete. Committee recommends
approval.

Title: Splash Pad Rules
Background: This is a presentation of rules for the new splash pad at
Carpenters Park.  We reviewed rules from several other
cities and used the ones that best fit our situation. Most of
the cities had the same basic rules.  Some of the items that
were different were number of days open, open/closing
times, and date to start and end season.  We had Public
Works input on the number of days per week to be open.
Public Works felt they needed one day a week to take care
of repairs and clean the splash pad area.  Most city splash
pads also had one day a week for repairs and cleaning.  The
open and closing times were set with the idea of giving
staff time in the morning to take care of any problems from
the night before and closing late so working parents could
bring their children to the park after work.
Summary: Through a joint effort of City departments, a set of Splash
Pad rules has been prepared for council review.
Recommendation: Committee recommends approval with changes.

Title: Acceptable Use Policy Update
Background: At the City Council meeting of April 14th, 2020, policy
1.15 was accepted with the request that two sections be
discussed further: the scope of the policy and section 1.4
detailing personal use of social networks and online
resources.
Summary: The scope has been updated for clarity. It is the intent that
all employees of the City of Milton whether part-time, full-
time, or contract, adhere to the appropriate use of internal
networks and business systems. Additionally, it is expected
that any third-party allowed access to the City’s internal
networks and/or business systems adhere to the same set of
principles.
Scope accepted on 4/14/2020:
This policy applies to the use of information,
electronic and computing devices, and network
resources to conduct City of Milton business or
interact with internal networks and business
systems, whether owned or leased by the City of
Milton, the employee, or a third party. All
employees, contractors, consultants, temporary,
and other workers at the City of Milton are
Council 6.9.2020 22 of 37
responsible for exercising good judgment
regarding appropriate use of information,
electronic devices, and network resources in
accordance with City of Milton policies and
standards, and local law, ordinance, and
regulation. Exceptions to this policy are
documented in the compliance section of this
policy.
Proposed update to the scope:
This policy applies to the use of information,
electronic and computing devices, and network
resources to conduct City of Milton business or
interact with internal networks and business
systems, whether owned or leased by the City of
Milton, the employee, or a third party. All
part-time employees, full-time employees,
contract employees, temporary, and other workers
at the City of Milton are responsible for
exercising good judgment regarding appropriate
use of information, electronic devices, and
network resources in accordance with City of
Milton policies and standards, and local law,
ordinance, and regulation. It is the
responsibility of any employee of the City of
Milton granting access to a third party
consultant, support agent, contractor, or any
other third party, to ensure all standards
detailed herein are adhered to and any
violations of the City of Milton’s Acceptable
Use Policy result in the removal of access to
the City’s internal networks and business
systems. Exceptions to this policy are
documented in the compliance section of this
policy.
Section 1.4 details the acceptable use of City network
resources for personal use by any City employee and has
similarly been updated for clarity.
Independent departments are required to interact with
social networking at differing levels and it is the intent of
the Information Technology department to ensure that all
usage follows the guidelines found in City policy 1.8:
Council 6.9.2020 23 of 37
Social Network Policy. Beyond adherence to the City’s
policy manual, the IT department recognizes that while
some departments have no business use for social networks
there are other departments that need to make continuous
use of social networking during regular business.
Because many of these sites require a personal account be
tied to City owned pages for management purposes,
Information Technology cannot authoritatively set a
limitation on access to personal accounts and is instead
looking to the individual departments to responsibly make
use of social networks.
Section 1.4 as adopted on 4/4/2020 states:
Employees are responsible for exercising good
judgment regarding the reasonableness of
personal use. Individual departments are
responsible for creating guidelines concerning
personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet
systems. All policies must adhere to the
guidelines found in City policy number 1.8:
Social Networking Policy.
Proposed update to 1.4:
All employees must adhere to the guidelines
found in City policy number 1.8: Social Network
Policy. Due to the differing scopes of
interaction with social networks and online
resources, individual departments must address
exceptions, limitations, and exemptions
regarding access to social networks and reflect
any policies differing from the City’s policy
manual within that department’s Standard
Operating Procedures. All employees are
responsible for exercising good judgment
regarding the reasonableness of personal use of
Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems.
Recommendation: Approve the update to the policy number 1.15: Acceptable
Use Policy.

parcel 08-1N-28-0000-01400-0000.  This parcel is owned
