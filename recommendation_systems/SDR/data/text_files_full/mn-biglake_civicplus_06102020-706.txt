Commercial Vehicle – Code Enforcement Extension

ACTION REQUESTED 
Staff requests that Council discuss a possible extension to the grace period set in place for code 
enforcement in regards to non-compliant commercial vehicles parked in residential neighborhoods.  
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
During the December 11, 2019 City Council Workshop, Staff was directed to begin enforcing the Code’s 
longstanding rule prohibiting any commercial vehicle larger than 12,000 pounds from being parked in a 
residential neighborhood. Enforcement was temporarily suspended while studying the issue prior to the 
Workshop discussion.  
 
The City Council decided to offer a grace period for those in violation. Non-compliant properties were sent 
a notice of upcoming code enforcement action and were told they had until July 1, 2020 to find a compliant, 
alternative option to park their commercial vehicles. The City Council directed Staff to begin enforcing the 
ordinance on July 2, 2020.  
 
Staff was approached by one of the non-compliant properties asking for an extension to the grace period 
due to the uncertainties of COVID and the inability to secure other options for parking their commercial 
vehicle.

Letter in Support of Options, Inc.

ACTION REQUESTED 
Consider directing Mayor, Mike Wallen, and City Administrator, Clay Wilfahrt, to sign a letter addressed 
to Legislators; urging them to consider emergency funding and allow Options, Inc. to resume operations 
with a safety plan.   
 
BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION 
Due to the Governor’s orders, Options, Inc. has been closed and has received zero funding from the 
Department of Human Services (DHS) since March 18, 2020.  
 
Options, Inc. plays a vital role in the Big Lake Community. They are the 6th largest employer in the City of 
Big Lake and have been in business for 40 years. The services provided by Options, Inc. is critical to support 
people with intellectual, developmental disabilities to live and work in our communities.  
 
Options, Inc. has a payroll of over $2.6 million in annual wages, which goes into our local economy. They not 
only pay living wages above industry standards but also directly spend over $160,000 on an annual basis to 
local vendors and small businesses. The majority of the 65 employees and 258 program participants live in 
the Big Lake area and Sherburne County. They count on over 80 business partners; providing critical 
employment opportunities and income for persons served.  
 
Options, Inc. does have a safety plan put together in response to COVID-19 and is ready to open their doors 
but they cannot do so without DHS releasing their funding. The Options, Inc. board will soon have to engage 
in a very real conversation about closing their doors if they don’t see positive movement from the legislature 
and DHS.  
 
The letter will be sent to the Health and Human Services (HHS) committee members in the House and the 
Senate, as well as their staff contacts. Both Senator Mary Kiffmeyer and Representative Paul Novotny are 
on the HHS committees.

Dear XXX: 
 
Options, Inc. plays a vital role in Big Lake as well as the broader community. As the sixth largest 
employer in the City of Big Lake and in business for over 40 years, their employees and persons served 
are a large part of the fabric of our community, i.e. volunteering for many community events and 
organizations.  The services provided by Options, Inc. is critical to support people with intellectual, 
developmental disabilities to live and work in our communities.  
 
Options, Inc. has a payroll of over $2.6 million annually, which goes into our local economy. They pay 
living wages above industry standards and directly spend over $160,000 annually to local vendors and 
small business.  The majority of the 65 employees and the 258 program participants live in the Big Lake 
area and Sherburne County. They count on over 80 businesses as partners, providing critical 
employment opportunities and income for persons served.  
 
Funding has been cut off to Options, Inc. since March 18th, 2020. Although they have worked in good 
faith with the Minnesota Department of Services (DHS), complying with regulatory rules and providing 
critical services on their behalf, there has been no interest from DHS or the legislature to provide 
emergency funding for fixed cost relief to protect them from closing permanently.  
 
The City of Big Lake as well as the Big Lake Economic Development Authority urges state leaders to 
consider emergency funding, as well as allow Options, Inc. to implement their robust COVID-19 safety 
plan and resume operations. The economic devastation caused by COVID-19 has our community anxious 
and during this time we certainly cannot lose such a vital community resource. Our hope is Options, Inc. 
will be able to remain open and resume full operations while keeping safety for program participants 
and Options, Inc. staff paramount. 
 
Sincerely,
