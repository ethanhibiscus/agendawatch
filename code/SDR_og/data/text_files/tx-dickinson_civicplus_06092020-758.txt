INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
 
To the Honorable Mayor and 
  City Council Members of the 
City of Dickinson, Texas: 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type 
activities, the discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund 
information of the City of Dickinson, Texas (the “City”), as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements as 
listed in the table of contents.   
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, 
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of 
the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.   
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk 
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the City’s preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control.  Accordingly, we express no 
such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinions. 
DRAFT
 
10 
Opinions 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective 
financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the discretely presented component 
units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City as of September 30, 2019, and 
the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended, in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Other Matters 
Required Supplementary Information 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis, budgetary comparison information, schedule of changes in net pension and total other 
postemployment liability and related ratios, schedule of the City’s proportionate share of the net pension liability, 
and the schedules of contributions, identified as Required Supplementary Information on the table of contents, be 
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic 
financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an 
essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, 
economic, or historical context.  We have applied certain limited procedures to the Required Supplementary 
Information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which 
consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the 
information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and 
other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements.  We do not express an opinion or 
provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient 
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 
Other Information 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the City’s basic financial statements.  The introductory section and combining and individual fund 
statements and schedules are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not required parts of the basic 
financial statements.   
The combining and individual fund statements and schedules are the responsibility of management and were 
derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial 
statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic 
financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information 
directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the 
basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our opinion, the combining and individual fund statements 
and schedules are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.  
The introductory section has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic 
financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated May 29, 2020 on our 
consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to 
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that 
testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control over financial reporting or 
on compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing 
Standards in considering the City’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

     Detail 
 
 
 
The City’s basic financial statements include (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) individual fund 
financial statements, and (3) notes to the financial statements.  This report also includes supplementary 
information intended to furnish additional detail to support the basic financial statements themselves. 
 
Government-Wide Statements 
 
The government-wide statements report information for the City as a whole.  These statements include 
transactions and balances relating to all assets, including infrastructure capital assets.  These statements are 
designed to provide information about cost of services, operating results, and financial position of the City as an 
economic entity.  The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities, which appear first in the City’s 
financial statements, report information on the City’s activities that enable the reader to understand the financial 
condition of the City.  These statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which is similar to the 
accounting used by most private-sector companies.  All of the current year’s revenues and expenses are taken into 
account even if cash has not yet changed hands. 
 
The Statement of Net Position presents information on all of the City’s assets, liabilities, and deferred 
outflows/inflows of resources, with the difference reported as net position.  Over time, increases or decreases in 
net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the City is improving or 
deteriorating.  Other nonfinancial factors, such as the City’s property tax base and the condition of the City’s 
infrastructure, need to be considered in order to assess the overall health of the City.

The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the City’s net position changed during the most 
recent year.  All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change 
occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows using the accrual method rather than modified accrual that is 
used in the fund level statements. 
 
The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities divide the City’s financials into two classes of 
activities: 
 
1. Governmental Activities – Most of the City’s basic services are reported here including general 
government, public safety, public works, culture and recreation, economic development, and 
community development.  Interest payments on the City’s debt are also reported here.  Sales tax, 
property tax, franchise fees, municipal court fines, and permit fees finance most of these 
activities. 
 
2. Business-Type Activities – Services involving a fee for those services are reported here.  These 
services include the City’s drainage services. 
 
The government-wide financial statements include not only the City itself (known as the primary government), 
but also a legally separate economic development corporation; a legally separate management district, for which 
the City is financially accountable; and a legally separate education finance corporation. Financial information for 
these component units is reported separately from the financial information presented for the primary government 
itself. The public improvement districts and the animal services corporation, although also legally separate, 
function for all practical purposes as departments of the City and, therefore, have been included as integral parts 
of the primary government. 
 
The government-wide financial statements can be found after the MD&A. 
 
FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Funds may be considered as operating companies of the parent corporation, which is the City.  They are usually 
segregated for specific activities or objectives.  The City uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate 
compliance with finance related legal reporting requirements.  The two categories of City funds are governmental 
and proprietary. 
 
Governmental Funds 
 
Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in 
the government-wide financial statements.  However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, 
governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources, as well 
as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the year.  Such information may be useful in 
evaluating the City’s near-term financing requirements. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is 
useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.  By doing so, readers may better understand 
the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.  Both the governmental fund balance 
sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a 
reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities.

The City maintains 20 individual governmental funds.  Information is presented separately in the governmental 
fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund 
balances for the general fund, debt service fund, street maintenance fund, and Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) Hurricane Harvey fund, which are considered to be major funds for reporting purposes.   
The City adopts an annual appropriated budget for its general, street maintenance, debt service, VOCA, Bayou 
Lakes Public Improvement District No. 1, Bayou Lakes Public Improvement District No. 2, federal seized funds, 
library impact grant, child safety, court efficiency, court security, court technology, and the hotel/motel funds.  
Budgetary comparison schedules have been provided for these funds to demonstrate compliance with these 
budgets. 
Proprietary Funds 
The City maintains two types of proprietary funds, enterprise funds and internal service funds.  The enterprise 
fund is used to report the same functions presented as business-type activities in the government-wide financial 
statements.  The City uses the enterprise fund to account for its municipal drainage utility fund.  The proprietary 
fund financial statements provide separate information for the municipal drainage utility operations.  The basic 
proprietary fund financial statements can be found in the basic financial statements of this report. 
An internal service fund is an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the City’s 
various functions.  The City uses the internal service funds to account for an employee benefit program and 
building maintenance costs.  Because these services predominantly benefit governmental rather than business-
type functions, they have been included within governmental activities in the government-wide financial 
statements.  
Component Units Combining Financial Statements 
The City’s three discretely presented component units shown in aggregate on the face of the government-wide 
financial statements have individual information for each of the discretely presented component units presented in 
the form of combining statements immediately following the fund financial statements of the primary 
government.  
Notes to Financial Statements 
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the 
data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements.  The notes are the last section of the basic 
financial statements. 
Other Information 
In addition to MD&A, basic financial statements, and accompanying notes, this report also presents certain 
Required Supplementary Information (RSI).  The RSI includes budgetary comparison schedules for the general 
fund and street maintenance fund and schedules of changes in net pension and total other postemployment 
benefits liability and related ratios, schedule of the City’s proportionate share of the net pension liability, and the 
schedules of contributions for the Texas Municipal Retirement System and Texas Emergency Services Retirement 
System.   RSI can be found after the notes to the basic financial statements.

GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
 
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of the City’s financial position.  Assets and 
deferred outflows of resources exceed liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $32,730,310 as of year end 
for the primary government. 
 
The largest portion of the City’s net position, 89 percent, reflects its investments in capital assets (e.g., land, 
construction in progress, buildings and improvements, vehicles and heavy equipment, furniture and fixtures, and 
infrastructure) less any debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.  The City uses these capital assets 
to provide services to citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.  Although the 
City’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to 
repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these 
liabilities.

For the year ended September 30, 2019, revenues from governmental activities totaled $21,339,046.  Revenues 
increased by $583,421 compared to the prior year mainly due to increases for operating grants and contributions, 
property taxes, and sales taxes. Property tax revenue increased due to an increase in the City’s tax levy. Sales tax 
revenue increased as a result of an increase in consumer spending. These increases in revenues were partially 
offset by decreases in revenues from capital grants and contributions as a result of a decrease in revenues related 
to the Community Development Block Grant program.  
 
For the year ended September 30, 2019, expenses for governmental activities totaled $22,275,321.  The total 
expenses decreased by 5% from the prior year. This decrease can be attributed mostly due to public works repairs 
expenses that were occurred in the prior year, but not in the current year. 
 
Business-type activities net position decreased by $9,437.  Revenues decreased by $205,258 expenses decreased 
$304,501 compared to the prior year primarily due to the City discontinuing utility service, therefore decreasing 
the overall financial activity in the current year.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S FUNDS 
As noted earlier, fund accounting is used to demonstrate and ensure compliance with finance-related legal 
requirements. 
Governmental Funds – The focus of the City’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term 
inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable resources.  Such information is useful in assessing the City’s 
financing requirements.  In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of the City’s net 
resources available for spending at the end of the year. 
The City’s governmental funds reflect a combined fund balance of $5,021,326.  Of this, $14,217 is nonspendable 
in the form of prepaid items, $91,235 is restricted for debt service, $1,332,008 is restricted for enabling 
legislation, $3,950,862 is restricted for capital projects, $28,518 is restricted for special projects, $338,219 is 
assigned, and negative $733,733 is unassigned. 
The general fund had a decrease in fund balance of $727,348 for the year. Revenues increased $1,352,432 
compared to the prior year. This increase was largely attributable to an increase in other revenues primarily due to 
a one time payment related to a tax abatement agreement refund.  The increase in revenues was partially offset by 
a decrease in license and permits revenues. Expenditures increased $3,092,166 compared to the prior year due 
largely to an increase in personnel and equipment costs.  Ending fund balance as a percentage of total 
expenditures was 27.12% as of fiscal year end. Unassigned fund balance as a percentage of total expenditures was 
24.98% as of fiscal year end. 
The debt service fund had a decrease in fund balance of $2,491, The decrease in fund balance is primarily because 
principal and interest payments on long-term debt exceeded revenues. 
The street maintenance fund had an increase in fund balance of $710,057.  The increase is primarily a result of 
sales tax revenue exceeding expenditures related to street projects. 
The FEMA Hurricane Harvey fund ended the year with a deficit fund balance of $4,826,393. As of September 30, 
2019, the project worksheets related to Hurricane Harvey-related expenditures were not approved by FEMA and, 
as a result, revenue was not recognized as earned. If these funds are not approved by FEMA, the general fund 
would have to transfer money to cover the loss. This would lead to a decrease of $4,826,393 in the general fund 
fund balance, leaving the fund with an ending deficit unassigned balance of $717,283 
Proprietary Funds – The City’s proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the 
government-wide financial statements, but in more detail. 
GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS 
Budgeted revenues exceeded actual revenues by $1,773,871 during the year mainly due to less than expected 
other revenues, primarily as a result of grants not received by the City.  General fund actual expenditures were 
less than the final budgeted expenditures by $2,888,634 mainly due to various departments having less 
expenditures than originally anticipated.

CAPITAL ASSETS 
 
At the end of the year, the City’s governmental activities funds had invested $36,244,880 in a variety of capital 
assets.  This represents a net increase of $429,829. 
 
Major capital asset events during the current year include the following: 
 
 
New camera system project totaling $122,571 
 
Purchase of seven vehicles and related equipment totaling $252,144 
More detailed information about the City’s capital assets is presented in note III.C. to the financial statements. 
 
LONG-TERM DEBT 
 
At the end of the current year, the City had total certificates of obligation and general obligation bonds of 
$7,090,000.  Of this amount, $1,055,000 represents certificates of obligation and $6,035,000 represents general 
obligation bonds. 
 
More detailed information about the City’s long-term liabilities is presented in note III.D. to the financial 
statements. 
 
ECONOMIC FACTORS AND NEXT YEAR’S BUDGET 
 
City Council approved a $15,182,530 general fund budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year.  This is a 8% increase 
from the prior year adopted budget.  The total tax rate adopted for the fiscal year 2019-2020 budget will be 
$0.44383. 
 
Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage in Texas in August 2017. It is the costliest natural disaster ever in 
the United States, primarily from widespread flooding in the Houston metropolitan area and southeast Texas area. 
In a four day period, many areas received more than 40 inches of rain as the system slowly meandered over 
eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic flooding. With peak accumulations of 64.58 inches, 
Hurricane Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States. The resulting floods inundated 
hundreds of thousands of homes, displaced more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues. 
Approximately one quarter of the State was impacted by the storm directly or indirectly, including the City, which 
was significantly impact. 
 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) during and immediately after the disaster pledged to assist the 
City and initially advanced $10,125,000, but after media attention on the disaster subsided, requested $5,337,660 
be returned, to the agency.  FEMA continues to use stringent standards as a means to reduce its initial promises of 
federal assistant, shifting an increasing burden on citizens that were personally devastated by the disaster, and 
may now need to help make the City whole, for funds that were pledged by federal officials.  The City has 
$4,872,156 in funds that were advanced by FEMA, which the City is increasingly concerned will be at risk as the 
Federal Governments collective memory of the local devastation of the event subsides.

report or requests for additional financial information should be directed to the City Administrator at City of

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the Statement of Activities are
different because:
Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds
$
(727,468)
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures.  However, in the
Statement of Activities, the cost of those assets is allocated over their estimated
useful lives and reported as depreciation expense.  
Capital outlay

Revenues in the Statement of Activities that do not provide current financial resources
are not reported as revenues in the funds.

The issuance of long-term debt (e.g., bonds, leases, certificates of obligation)
provides current financial resources to governmental funds, while the
repayment of the principal of long-term debt consumes the current financial 
resources of governmental funds. Neither transaction, however, has any 
effect on net position. Also, governmental funds report the effect of premiums,
 
discounts, and similar items when they are first issued, whereas these
amounts are deferred and amortized in the Statement of Activities.

I.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
A. Reporting Entity 
 
The Village of Dickinson, Texas was incorporated by virtue of an election in August 1977.  The 
Village of Dickinson, Texas became the City of Dickinson, Texas (the “City”) in December 1982.  
The City operates under a Council-Mayor form of government.  The Mayor and six Council 
Members are elected from the City at large serving three-year terms.  The City Council is the 
principal legislative body of the City.  The City Administrator, City Prosecutor, Municipal Court 
Judge, Police Chief, and City Secretary are appointed by City Council.  The City Administrator is 
responsible for appointment and removal of department directors and employees, supervision and 
control of all City departments, and preparation of the annual budget.  The Mayor presides at 
meetings of the City Council and can vote only in the case of a tie vote. 
 
The City provides the following services:  public safety, public works, culture and recreation, 
economic development, community development, drainage, and general government administration.  
Fire protection is provided through a volunteer department. 
 
The City is an independent political subdivision of the State and is considered a primary government.  
As required by generally accepted accounting principles, these basic financial statements have been 
prepared based on considerations regarding the potential for inclusion of other entities, 
organizations, or functions as part of the City’s financial reporting entity.  The component units, as 
listed below, although legally separate, are considered part of the reporting entity.  No other entities 
have been included in the City’s reporting entity.  Additionally, as the City is considered a primary 
government for financial reporting purposes, its activities are not considered a part of any other 
governmental or other type of reporting entity. 
 
Considerations regarding the potential for inclusion of other entities, organizations, or functions in 
the City’s financial reporting entity are based on criteria prescribed by generally accepted accounting 
principles.  These same criteria are evaluated in considering whether the City is a part of any other 
governmental or other type of reporting entity.  The overriding elements associated with prescribed 
criteria considered in determining that the City’s financial reporting entity status is that of a primary 
government are that it has a separately elected governing body, it is a legally separate entity, and it is 
fiscally independent of other state and local governments.  Additionally, prescribed criteria under 
generally accepted accounting principles include considerations pertaining to organizations for 
which the primary government is financially accountable, and considerations pertaining to 
organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship with the primary government 
are such that exclusion would cause the reporting entity’s financial statements to be misleading or 
incomplete. 
 
Discretely Presented Component Units 
 
Dickinson Economic Development Corporation  
 
Dickinson Economic Development Corporation (the “Corporation”) is a not-for-profit corporation 
established for the specific purpose of economic development with the City through the use of 
dedicated sales tax revenues.  The Board members of the Corporation are approved by City Council, 
as is the annual budget.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Dickinson Management District No. 1 
 
Dickinson Management District No. 1 (the “District”) was created for the purposes of managing and 
financing improvement projects and/or services benefiting the District.  These activities include 
maintenance and beautification of the area; development and/or expansion of transportation and 
commerce; promotion of health, safety, and welfare of the City; and general and administrative costs. 
The Board members of the District are appointed by City Council.  
 
Dickinson Education Finance Corporation 
 
The Dickinson Education Finance Corporation (DEFC) was organized exclusively for the purpose of 
financing or refinancing educational facilities.  The members of the Board are appointed by the City 
Council. 
 
Blended Component Units 
 
Bayou Lakes Public Improvement District No. 1 
 
Bayou Lakes Public Improvement District No. 1 (the “PID No. 1”) has been included in the 
reporting entity as a blended component unit.  The PID No. 1 was created to promote the interests of 
the City in an improvement project that confers a special benefit on a definable part of the City.  This 
improvement project includes landscaping; lighting and signs; and construction and improvement of 
water, wastewater, and drainage. 
 
The City reimburses a developer for the costs of creating and operating the PID No. 1 from 
assessments collected from homeowners.  The City charges the PID No. 1 a fee for administration 
and operating expenses and audit. 
 
Bayou Lakes Public Improvement District No. 2 
 
Bayou Lakes Public Improvement District No. 2 (the “PID No. 2”) has been included in the 
reporting entity as a blended component unit.  The PID No. 2 was created to promote the interests of 
the City in an improvement project that confers a special benefit on a definable part of the City.  
 
The City reimburses a developer for the costs of creating and operating the PID No. 2 from 
assessments collected from homeowners.  The City charges the PID No. 2 a fee for administration 
and operating expenses and audit. 
 
Bayou Animal Services Corporation 
 
Bayou Animal Services Corporation (the “Corporation”) has been included in the reporting entity as 
a blended component unit.  The Corporation was created to provide animal control, sheltering 
services, and any and all related functions associated therewith.  The Corporation entered into 
interlocal agreements with the cities of Dickinson, Clear Lake Shores, and Santa Fe for the purposes 
of providing full-time animal control and sheltering services, administrative functions, and other 
related governmental functions on behalf of these cities.  These cities will provide an annual fee 
based upon the pro-rata share of their respective populations as determined by the latest U.S. Census 
Bureau estimates as of June 1 of each year.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
 
49 
The component units identified above are included in the City’s reporting entity because of the 
significance of their operational or financial relationships with the City.  The City appoints a 
majority of these organizations’ boards and is either able to impose its will on them or a financial 
benefit/burden exists. 
 
Complete financial statements of the individual component units can be obtained directly from 
administrative offices of the City. 
 
B. Government-Wide Financial Statements 
 
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of 
Activities) report information on all of the activities of the primary government and its component 
units. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes, intergovernmental revenues, 
and other nonexchange transactions, are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely 
to a significant extent on fees and charges to external customers for support. Likewise, the primary 
government is reported separately from certain legally separate component units for which the 
primary government is financially accountable. 
 
C. Basis of Presentation – Government-Wide Financial Statements 
 
While separate government-wide and fund financial statements are presented, they are interrelated. 
The governmental activities column incorporates data from governmental funds, while business-type 
activities incorporate data from the City’s enterprise funds. Separate financial statements are 
provided for governmental funds and proprietary funds. 
 
As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide 
financial statements. Exceptions to this general rule are payments in lieu of taxes where the amounts 
are reasonably equivalent in value to the interfund services provided and other charges between the 
City’s drainage functions and various other functions of the City. Elimination of these charges would 
distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the various functions concerned. 
 
D. Basis of Presentation – Fund Financial Statements 
 
The fund financial statements provide information about the City’s funds, including its blended 
component units. Separate statements for each fund category – governmental and proprietary – are 
presented. The emphasis of fund financial statements is on major governmental and enterprise funds, 
each displayed in a separate column. All remaining governmental and enterprise funds are 
aggregated and reported as nonmajor funds.  
 
The City reports the following governmental funds: 
 
The general fund is the City’s primary operating fund. It is used to account for and report all 
financial resources not accounted for and reported in other funds.  The principal sources of 
revenues include local property taxes, sales taxes, franchise fees, licenses and permits, fines and 
forfeitures, and charges for services.  Expenditures include general government, public safety, 
public works, culture and recreation, community development, and economic development.  The 
general fund is always considered a major fund for reporting purposes. 
 
The debt service fund is used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, 
committed, or assigned to expenditure for principal and interest on all long-term debt of the City.  
DRAFT
City of Dickinson, Texas  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
 
50 
The primary source of revenue for debt service is local property taxes.  The debt service fund is 
not considered a major fund for reporting purposes but the City has elected to present as a major 
fund due to its significance. 
 
The capital projects fund is used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, 
committed, or assigned to expenditure for capital outlay, including the acquisition of capital 
facilities and other capital assets.  The vehicle acquisition fund is considered a nonmajor fund for 
reporting purposes.   
 
The special revenue funds are used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue 
sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specific purposes other than debt 
service or capital projects.  The street maintenance fund and the FEMA Hurricane Harvey fund 
are included as major funds.  Nonmajor special revenue funds include special revenue and grants, 
VOCA, CDBG disaster recovery, Bayou Lakes PID No. 1, Bayou Lakes PID No. 2, federal 
seized funds, library impact grant, child safety, court efficiency, court security, court technology, 
state seized funds, hotel/motel, Bayou Animal Services Corporation, and hurricane relief funds. 
 
The City reports the following enterprise fund: 
 
The enterprise fund is used to account for and report the operations that provide municipal 
drainage services.  The services are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business 
enterprises where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses including 
depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis will be 
financed or recovered primarily through user charges.  The municipal drainage utility fund is 
considered a major fund for reporting purposes. 
 
Additionally, the City reports the following fund type: 
 
Internal service funds account for services provided to other departments of the City, or to other 
governments, on a cost reimbursement basis.  The employee benefit fund is used to account for 
insurance provided to City employees. The building maintenance fund is used to account for 
facility maintenance costs. 
 
During the course of operations, the City has activity between funds for various purposes. Any 
residual balances outstanding at year end are reported as due from/to other funds and advances 
to/from other funds. While these balances are reported in fund financial statements, certain 
eliminations are made in the preparation of the government-wide financial statements. Balances 
between the funds included in governmental activities (i.e., the governmental and internal service 
funds) are eliminated so that only the net amount is included as internal balances in the 
governmental activities column. Similarly, balances between the funds included in business-type 
activities (i.e., the enterprise funds) are eliminated so that only the net amount is included as internal 
balances in the business-type activities column. 
 
Further, certain activity occurs during the year involving transfers of resources between funds. In 
fund financial statements, these amounts are reported at gross amounts as transfers in/out. While 
reported in fund financial statements, certain eliminations are made in the preparation of the 
government-wide financial statements. Transfers between the funds included in governmental 
activities are eliminated so that only the net amount is included as transfers in the governmental 
activities column. Similarly, balances between the funds included in business-type activities are

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
 
51 
eliminated so that only the net amount is included as internal balances in the business-type activities 
column. 
 
E. Measurement Focus and Basis of Accounting 
 
The accounting and financial reporting treatment is determined by the applicable measurement focus 
and basis of accounting. Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured such as 
current financial resources or economic resources. The basis of accounting indicates the timing of 
transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements. 
 
The government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements are reported using the economic 
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when 
earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash 
flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and 
similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the 
provider have been met. 
 
The governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources 
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon 
as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are 
collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. 
For this purpose, the City considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of 
the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, 
as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to 
compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. General 
capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuance of long-term 
debt and acquisitions under capital leases are reported as other financing sources.   
 
Property taxes, sales taxes, franchise fees, licenses, and interest associated with the current fiscal 
period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual and so have been recognized as revenues of the 
current fiscal period. Entitlements are recorded as revenues when all eligibility requirements are met, 
including any time requirements, and the amount is received during the period or within the 
availability period for this revenue source (within 60 days of year end). Expenditure-driven grants 
are recognized as revenue when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred and all other 
eligibility requirements have been met, and the amount is received during the period or within the 
availability period for this revenue source (within 60 days of year end). All other revenue items are 
considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the City. 
 
F. Assets, Liabilities, Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources, and Net Position/Fund Balance 
 
1. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
The City’s cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-
term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.  For 
the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the proprietary fund types consider temporary 
investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 
 
The City maintains a pooled cash and investments account for all funds of the City.  Each fund’s 
positive equity in the pooled cash account is presented as cash and cash equivalents or investments.

Interest income is allocated to each respective individual fund monthly based on their representative 
fund balances. 
 
2. Investments 
 
Investments, except for certain investment pools, commercial paper, money market funds, and 
investment contracts, are reported at fair value. The investment pools operate in accordance with 
appropriate state laws and regulations and are reported at amortized cost. Money market funds, 
which are short-term highly liquid debt instruments that may include U.S. Treasury and agency 
obligations and commercial paper that have a remaining maturity of one year or less upon 
acquisition, are reported at amortized cost. Investments in nonparticipating interest earning contracts, 
such as certificates of deposit, are reported at cost.  
 
The City has adopted a written investment policy regarding the investment of its funds as defined in 
the Public Funds Investment Act, Chapter 2256, Texas Government Code.  In summary, the City is 
authorized to invest in the following: 
 
Obligations of the U.S. Treasury 
Fully collateralized certificates of deposit and money market accounts with local depository  
   banks 
Local government investment pools 
Repurchase agreements 
 
3. Prepaid Items 
 
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods (prepaid 
expenditures) are recognized as expenditures when utilized.  
 
4. Capital Assets 
 
Capital assets, which include property, plant, vehicles, equipment, and infrastructure assets (e.g., 
roads, bridges, sidewalks, and similar items), are reported in the applicable governmental or 
business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements.  In accordance with 
GASB Statement No. 34, infrastructure has been capitalized retroactively. Capital assets are defined 
by the City as assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life 
in excess of three years.  Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if 
purchased or constructed.  Donated capital assets are recorded at acquisition value at the date of 
donation.   
 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed.  
Interest costs incurred in connection with construction of enterprise fund capital assets are 
capitalized when the effects of capitalization materially impact the financial statements. 
 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially 
extend assets’ lives are not capitalized.

5. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources 
 
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for 
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of 
resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not 
be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then. In addition to liabilities, 
the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows of 
resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an 
acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an 
inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.  
 
Deferred outflows/inflows of resources are amortized as follows: 
 
• 
Deferred outflows/inflows from pension/other postemployment benefits (OPEB) activities 
are amortized over the average of the expected service lives of pension/OPEB plan 
members, except for the net differences between the projected and actual investment 
earnings on the pension/OPEB plan assets, which are amortized over a period of five years. 
• 
For employer pension/OPEB plan contributions that were made subsequent to the 
measurement date through the end of the City’s fiscal year, the amount is deferred and 
recognized as a reduction to the net pension/OPEB liability during the measurement period 
in which the contributions were made. 
• 
A deferred charge on refunding results from the difference in the carrying value of refunded 
debt and its reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter of 
the life of the refunded or refunding debt. 
 
At the fund level, the City has only one type of item, which arises only under a modified accrual 
basis of accounting, that qualifies for reporting in this category. Accordingly, the item, unavailable 
revenue, is reported only in the governmental funds balance sheet. The governmental funds report 
unavailable revenues from property taxes and emergency medical services. These amounts are 
deferred and recognized as inflows of resources in the period that the amounts become available. 
 
6. Compensated Employee Absences 
 
It is the City’s policy to permit employees to accumulate earned but unused vacation and 
compensatory time.  Vacation benefits are earned based on the employees’ years of service with the 
City. Vacation and compensatory time amounts accumulated may be paid to employees upon 
termination of employment or at retirement up to a certain amount.    The estimated amount of 
compensation for services provided that is expected to be liquidated with expendable, available 
financial resources is reported as an expenditure and a fund liability of the governmental fund that 
will pay it when it becomes due.  Amounts of vested or accumulated vacation leave that are not

City of Dickinson, Texas  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
 
54 
expected to be liquidated with expendable, available financial resources are maintained separately 
and represent a reconciling item between the fund and government-wide presentations. 
 
7. Long-Term Obligations 
 
In the government-wide financial statements and proprietary fund types in the fund financial 
statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable 
governmental activities, business-type activities, or proprietary fund type Statement of Net Position. 
Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the 
straight-line method, if material. Bonds payable are reported net of the applicable bond premium or 
discount.  
 
In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize bond premiums and discounts, 
as well as bond issuance costs, during the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported 
as other financing sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing 
sources while discounts on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, 
whether or not withheld from the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service 
expenditures.  
 
The property tax rate is allocated each year between the general and debt service funds.  The full 
amount estimated to be required for debt service on general obligation debt is provided by the tax 
along with the interest earned in the debt service fund.  Although a portion of the general obligation 
debt was directly related to the purchase of water and sewer infrastructure, the debt service 
expenditures are included in the governmental fund financial statements as they are expected to be 
paid from debt service tax revenues instead of water system revenues. 
 
Assets acquired under the terms of a capital lease are recorded as liabilities and capitalized in the 
government-wide financial statements at the present value of net minimum lease payments at 
inception of the lease.  In the year of acquisition, capital lease transactions are recorded as other 
financing sources and as capital outlay expenditures in the applicable fund.  Lease payments 
representing both principal and interest are recorded as expenditures in the general fund upon 
payment with an appropriate reduction of principal recorded in the government-wide financial 
statements. 
 
8. Net Position Flow Assumption 
 
Sometimes the City will fund outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted (e.g., restricted 
bond or grant proceeds) and unrestricted resources. In order to calculate the amounts to report as 
restricted net position and unrestricted net position in the government-wide and proprietary fund 
financial statements, a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the resources are 
considered to be applied. It is the City’s policy to consider restricted net position to have been 
depleted before unrestricted net position is applied. 
 
9. Fund Balance Flow Assumptions 
 
Sometimes the City will fund outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted and unrestricted 
resources (the total of committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance). In order to calculate the 
amounts to report as restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance in the 
governmental fund financial statements, a flow assumption must be made about the order in which 
the resources are considered to be applied. It is the City’s policy to consider restricted fund balance 
DRAFT
City of Dickinson, Texas  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
 
55 
to have been depleted before using any of the components of unrestricted fund balance. Further, 
when the components of unrestricted fund balance can be used for the same purpose, committed 
fund balance is depleted first, followed by assigned fund balance. Unassigned fund balance is 
applied last. 
 
10. Fund Balance Policies 
 
Fund balances of governmental funds are reported in various categories based on the nature of any 
limitations requiring the use of resources for specific purposes. The City itself can establish 
limitations on the use of resources through either a commitment (committed fund balance) or an 
assignment (assigned fund balance). 
 
Amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form or legally or 
contractually required to be maintained intact are classified as nonspendable fund balance.  Amounts 
that are externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other 
governments or imposed by law through constitutional provisions are classified as restricted. 
 
The committed fund balance classification includes amounts that can be used only for the specific 
purposes determined by a formal action of the City’s highest level of decision-making authority. The 
City Council is the highest level of decision-making authority for the City that can, by adoption of an 
ordinance prior to the end of the fiscal year, commit fund balance. Once adopted, the limitation 
imposed by the ordinance remains in place until a similar action is taken (the adoption of another 
ordinance) to remove or revise the limitation. 
 
Amounts in the assigned fund balance classification are intended to be used by the City for specific 
purposes but do not meet the criteria to be classified as committed. The City Council may also assign 
fund balance as it does when appropriating fund balance to cover a gap between estimated revenue 
and appropriations in the subsequent year’s appropriated budget. Unlike commitments, assignments 
generally only exist temporarily. In other words, an additional action does not normally have to be 
taken for the removal of an assignment. Conversely, as discussed above, an additional action is 
essential to either remove or revise a commitment. 
 
11. Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures/expenses during the reporting period.  Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. 
 
12. Pensions 
 
For the purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred 
inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net 
position of the Texas Municipal Retirement System (TMRS) and the Texas Emergency Services 
Retirement System (TESRS) and additions to/deductions from TMRS’s and TESRS’s fiduciary net 
position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by TMRS and TESRS. For this 
purpose, plan contributions are recognized in the period that compensation is reported for the 
employee, which is when contributions are legally due. Benefit payments and refunds are recognized 
when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.

13. Other Postemployment Benefits 
 
The City participates in a single-employer, unfunded, defined benefit group-term life insurance plan 
operated by TMRS known as the Supplemental Death Benefits Fund (SDBF). The City elected, by 
ordinance, to provide group-term life insurance coverage to both current and retired employees. The 
funding policy for the SDBF program is to assure that adequate resources are available to meet all 
death benefit payments for the upcoming year.  Benefit payments are treated as being equal to the 
employer’s yearly contributions for retirees. Benefit payments and refunds are due and payable in 
accordance with the benefit terms. Information about the City’s total OPEB liability, deferred 
outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, and OPEB expense is provided by TMRS from 
reports prepared by their consulting actuary. 
 
G. Revenues and Expenditures/Expenses 
 
1. Program Revenues 
 
Amounts reported as program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, 
use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or segment 
and 2) grants and contributions (including special assessments) that are restricted to meeting the 
operational or capital requirements of a particular function or segment. All taxes, including those 
dedicated for specific purposes, and other internally dedicated resources are reported as general 
revenues rather than as program revenues. 
 
2. Property Taxes 
 
Property taxes are levied on October 1 of each year, are due upon receipt of the City’s tax bill, and 
become delinquent on February 1 of the following year.  The City’s tax lien exists from January 1 
(the assessment date) each year until the taxes are paid. 
 
3. Proprietary Funds Operating and Nonoperating Revenues and Expenses 
 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. Operating 
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods 
in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating 
revenues of the enterprise fund are charges to customers for sales and services. Operating expenses 
for the enterprise fund include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses, and 
depreciation on capital assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as 
nonoperating revenues and expenses. 
 
II.  STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
A.  Budgetary Information 
 
Annual budgets are adopted on a budget basis.  The original budget is adopted by the City Council 
prior to the beginning of the year.  The legal level of control, as defined by the charter, in the 
approved budget is the department level.  The City Administrator may transfer appropriations within 
a department without seeking the approval of City Council.  Appropriations lapse at the end of the 
year. Encumbrance accounting is not utilized.

The FEMA Hurricane Harvey fund incurred costs in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Prior to 
year end, FEMA approved a public assistance request in the amount of $10,125,000. The approval 
associated with project worksheets was pending as of year end. Hurricane Harvey caused 
widespread damage in Texas in August 2017. It is the costliest natural disaster ever in the United 
States, primarily from widespread flooding in the Houston metropolitan area and southeast Texas 
area. In a four day period, many areas received more than 40 inches of rain as the system slowly 
meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic flooding. With peak 
accumulations of 64.58 inches, Hurricane Harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the 
United States. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaced more than 
30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues. Approximately one quarter of the State 
was impacted by the storm directly or indirectly, including the City, which was significantly 
impact. 
 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) during and immediately after the disaster 
pledged to assist the City and initially advanced $10,125,000, but after media attention on the 
disaster subsided, requested $5,337,660 be returned, to the agency.  FEMA continues to use 
stringent standards as a means to reduce its initial promises of federal assistant, shifting an 
increasing burden on citizens that were personally devastated by the disaster, and may now need to 
help make the City whole, for funds that were pledged by federal officials.  The City has 
$4,872,156 in funds that were advanced by FEMA, which the City is increasingly concerned will be 
at risk as the Federal Governments collective memory of the local devastation of the event subsides.

Interest rate risk.  In accordance with the City investment policy, the City manages its exposure to 
declines in fair values by structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash 
requirements for ongoing operations. 
 
Credit risk.  The City’s investment policy limits investments in money market mutual funds rated as 
to investment quality not less than “AAA” by at least one nationally recognized rating service.  As of 
September 30, 2019, the City’s investment in TexPool was rated “AAAm” by Standard & Poor’s.  
 
Concentration of credit risk.  To guard against default possibilities and to assure diversification of 
bidders, business with any one issuer or investment broker should be limited to 40 percent of the 
total portfolio at any point in time.  
 
Custodial credit risk – deposits.  In the case of deposits, this is the risk that in the event of a bank 
failure, the City’s deposits may not be returned to it.  As of September 30, 2019, the bank balances 
were $15,236,852, of which $500,000 was insured by FDIC.  The market values of pledged 
securities were $16,585,087.  
 
Custodial credit risk – investments.  For an investment, this is the risk that, in the event of the failure 
of the counterparty, the City will not be able to recover the value of its investments or collateral 
securities that are in the possession of an outside party.  The City’s investment policy requires that it 
will seek to safekeeping securities at financial institutions, avoiding physical possession.  Further, all 
trades, where applicable, are executed by delivery versus payment to ensure that securities are 
deposited in the City’s safekeeping account prior to the release of funds.   
 
TexPool 
 
TexPool was established as a trust company with the Treasurer of the State of Texas as trustee, 
segregated from all other trustees, investments, and activities of the trust company. The State 
Comptroller of Public Accounts exercises oversight responsibility over TexPool. Oversight includes 
the ability to significantly influence operations, designation of management, and accountability for 
fiscal matters. Additionally, the State Comptroller has established an advisory board composed of 
both participants in TexPool and other persons who do not have a business relationship with 
TexPool. The advisory board members review the investment policy and management fee structure. 
Standard & Poor’s rated TexPool “AAAm”. As a requirement to maintain the rating, weekly 
portfolio information must be submitted to Standard & Poor’s, as well as to the office of the 
Comptroller of Public Accounts for review.

TexPool is an external investment pool measured at amortized cost. In order to meet the criteria to be 
recorded at amortized cost, TexPool must transact at a stable net asset value per share and maintain 
certain maturity, quality, liquidity, and diversification requirements within TexPool. TexPool 
transacts at a net asset value of $1.00 per share, has weighted average maturities of 60 days or less, 
and weighted average lives of 120 days or less. Investments held are highly rated by nationally 
recognized statistical rating organizations, have no more than five percent of portfolio with one 
issuer (excluding U.S. government securities), and can meet reasonably foreseeable redemptions. 
TexPool has a redemption notice period of one day and may redeem daily. TexPool’s authority may 
only impose restrictions on redemptions in the event of a general suspension of trading on major 
securities markets, general banking moratorium, or national state of emergency that affects 
TexPool’s liquidity.

Long-term liabilities applicable to the City’s governmental activities are not due and payable in the 
current period and, accordingly, are not reported as fund liabilities in the governmental funds.  The 
governmental activities compensated absences are generally liquidated by the general fund.  Interest 
on long-term debt is not accrued in governmental funds, but rather is recognized as an expenditure 
when due.

Certificates of obligation are direct obligations of the City for which its full faith and credit are 
pledged.  Repayment is from taxes levied on all taxable property located within the City.  
 
The Corporation agreed to pay a portion of the series 2000 certificates of obligation (subsequently 
refunded with the Series 2009 refunding general obligation bonds).

Federal Arbitrage 
 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 instituted certain arbitrage restrictions consisting of complex 
regulations with respect to issuance of tax-exempt bonds after August 31, 1986.  Arbitrage 
regulations deal with the investment of tax-exempt bond proceeds at an interest yield greater than the 
interest yield paid to bondholders.  Generally, all interest paid to bondholders can be retroactively 
rendered taxable if applicable rebates are not reported and paid to the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) at least every five years for applicable bond issues.  Accordingly, there is the risk that if such 
calculations are not performed, or are not performed correctly, a substantial liability to the City 
could result.  The City periodically engages an arbitrage consultant to perform the calculations in 
accordance with the rules and regulations of the IRS.

IV.  OTHER INFORMATION 
 
A. Risk Management 
 
The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of 
assets; errors and omissions; and natural disasters for which the City participates along with 2,617 
other entities in the Texas Municipal League’s Intergovernmental Risk Pool (the “Pool”).  The Pool 
purchases commercial insurance at group rates for participants in the Pool.  The City has no 
additional risk or responsibility to the Pool, outside of the payment of insurance premiums.  The City 
has not significantly reduced insurance coverage or had settlements that exceeded coverage amounts 
for the past three years. 
 
B. Contingent Liabilities 
 
Amounts received or receivable from granting agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by 
grantor agencies, principally the federal government.  Any disallowed claims, including amounts 
already collected, may constitute a liability of the applicable funds.  The amount of expenditures that 
may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time although the City expects such 
amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
 
The City is a defendant in several lawsuits.  Although the outcome of the lawsuits is not presently 
determinable, it is the opinion of the City’s counsel that resolution of these matters will not have a 
material adverse effect on the financial condition of the City. 
 
Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated.  Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not 
reported.  Claim liabilities are calculated considering the effects of inflation, recent claim settlement 
trends including frequency and amount of payouts, and other economic and social factors.  No claim 
liabilities are reported at year end.

C.  Pension Plans 
 
1. Texas Municipal Retirement System 
      
Plan Description 
 
The City participates as one of 887 plans in the nontraditional, joint contributory, hybrid defined 
benefit pension plan administered by TMRS. TMRS is an agency created by the State of Texas and 
administered in accordance with the TMRS Act, Subtitle G, Title 8, Texas Government Code (the 
“TMRS Act”) as an agent multiple-employer retirement system for municipal employees in the State 
of Texas. The TMRS Act places the general administration and management of TMRS with a six-
member Board of Trustees (the “Board”). Although the Governor, with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, appoints the Board, TMRS is not fiscally dependent on the State of Texas. TMRS’s defined 
benefit pension plan is a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
TMRS issues a publicly available comprehensive annual financial report that can be obtained at 
www.tmrs.com. 
 
All eligible employees of the City are required to participate in TMRS. 
 
Benefits Provided 
 
TMRS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits. Benefit provisions are adopted by the 
governing body of the City, within the options available in the state statutes governing TMRS.  
 
At retirement, the benefit is calculated as if the sum of the employee’s contributions, with interest, 
and the City-financed monetary credits, with interest, were used to purchase an annuity. Members 
may choose to receive their retirement benefit in one of seven payment options. Members may also 
choose to receive a portion of their benefit as a partial lump sum distribution in an amount equal to 
12, 24, or 36 monthly payments, which cannot exceed 75 percent of the member’s deposits and 
interest. 
 
The plan provisions are adopted by the governing body of the City, within the options available in 
the state statutes governing TMRS.  Plan provisions for the City were as follows:

Contributions 
 
The contribution rates for employees in TMRS are either five percent, six percent, or seven percent 
of employee gross earnings, and the City-matching percentages are either 100 percent, 150 percent, 
or 200 percent, both as adopted by the governing body of the City. Under the state law governing 
TMRS, the contribution rate for each city is determined annually by the actuary, using the Entry Age 
Normal (EAN) actuarial cost method. The actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount 
necessary to finance the cost of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional 
amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. 
 
Employees for the City were required to contribute seven percent of their annual gross earnings 
during the fiscal year. The contribution rates for the City were 9.46 percent in calendar years 2019 
and 2018. The City’s contributions to TMRS for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 were 
$504,892 which were equal to the required contributions. 
 
Net Pension Liability 
 
The City’s Net Pension Liability (NPL) was measured as of December 31, 2018 and the Total 
Pension Liability (TPL) used to calculate the NPL was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
that date. 
 
Actuarial Assumptions 
 
The TPL in the December 31, 2018 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial 
assumptions:  
 
Inflation  
 
 
2.50% per year  
Overall payroll growth  
 
3.00% per year  
Investment rate of return   
6.75%, net of pension plan investment expense, including inflation 
 
Salary increases were based on a service-related table. Mortality rates for active members, retirees, 
and beneficiaries were based on the gender-distinct RP2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Tables 
with Blue Collar Adjustment, with male rates multiplied by 109 percent and female rates multiplied 
by 103 percent.  The rates are projected on a fully generational basis by scale BB to account for 
future mortality improvements. For disabled annuitants, the gender-distinct RP2000 Combined 
Healthy Mortality Tables with Blue Collar Adjustment are used with male rates multiplied by 109 
percent and female rates multiplied by 103 percent with a three-year set-forward for both males and 
females.  In addition, a three percent minimum mortality rate is applied to reflect the impairment for 
younger members who become disabled.  The rates are projected on a fully generational basis by 
scale BB to account for future mortality improvements subject to the three percent floor.

The actuarial assumptions were developed primarily from the actuarial investigation of the 
experience of TMRS over the four-year period from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2014. 
They were adopted in 2015 and first used in the December 31, 2015 actuarial valuation.  The post-
retirement mortality assumption for healthy annuitants and annuity purchase rate are based on the 
mortality experience investigation study covering 2009 through 2011 and dated December 31, 2013.  
In conjunction with these changes first used in the December 31, 2013 valuation, TMRS adopted the 
EAN actuarial cost method and a one-time change to the amortization policy.  Plan assets are 
managed on a total return basis with an emphasis on both capital appreciation, as well as the 
production of income, in order to satisfy the short-term and long-term funding needs of TMRS.  
 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-
block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, 
net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. 
These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the 
expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected 
inflation.  In determining their best estimate of a recommended investment return assumption under 
the various alternative asset allocation portfolios, the actuary focused on the area between (1) 
arithmetic mean (aggressive) without an adjustment for time (conservative) and (2) the geometric 
mean (conservative) with an adjustment for time (aggressive).   
 
The target allocation and best estimates of real rates of return for each major asset class are 
summarized in the following table.

Discount Rate 
 
The discount rate used to measure the TPL was 6.75 percent. The projection of cash flows used to 
determine the discount rate assumed that employee and employer contributions will be made at the 
rates specified in statute. Based on that assumption, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was 
projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current active and inactive 
employees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was 
applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the TPL.

2.  Texas Emergency Services Retirement System 
 
Plan Description 
 
The City participates in a cost-sharing multiple employer pension plan that has a special funding 
situation. The plan is administered by TESRS and established and administered by the State of Texas 
(the “State”) to provide pension benefits for emergency services personnel who serve without 
significant monetary remuneration. At August 31, 2018, there were 203 contributing fire and/or 
emergency services department members participating in TESRS. Eligible participants include 
volunteer emergency services personnel who are members in good standing of a member 
department. 
 
On August 31, 2018, the pension system membership consisted of: 
 
Retirees and beneficiaries currently receiving benefits
3,104
Terminated members entitled to, but not yet receiving, benefits
2,208
Active participants
4,046  
 
Pension Plan Fiduciary Net Position 
 
Detailed information about the TESRS’s fiduciary net position is available in a separately-issued 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report that includes financial statements and Required 
Supplementary Information.  TESRS issues a publicly available Annual Financial Report, which 
includes financial statements, notes, and Required Supplementary Information, which can be 
obtained at www.tesrs.org. The separately issued actuarial valuations that may be of interest are also 
available at the same link. 
 
Benefits Provided 
 
Senate Bill 411, 65th Legislature, Regular Session (1977), created TESRS and established the 
applicable benefit provisions. The 79th Legislature, Regular Session (2005), re-codified the 
provisions and gave the TESRS Board of Trustees (the “Board”) authority to establish vesting 
requirements, contribution levels, benefit formulas, and eligibility requirements by Board rule. The 
DRAFT

benefit provisions include retirement benefits, as well as death and disability benefits. Members are 
50 percent vested after the tenth year of service, with the vesting percentage increasing ten percent 
for each of the next five years of service so that a member becomes 100 percent vested with 15 years 
of service. 
 
Upon reaching age 55, each vested member may retire and receive a monthly pension equal to his 
vested percentage multiplied by six times the governing body’s average monthly contribution over 
the member’s years of qualified service. For years of service in excess of 15 years, this monthly 
benefit is increased at the rate of 6.2 percent compounded annually. There is no provision for 
automatic post retirement benefit increases. 
 
On and off-duty death benefits and on-duty disability benefits are dependent on whether or not the 
member was engaged in the performance of duties at the time of death or disability. Death benefits 
include a lump sum amount or continuing monthly payments to a member’s surviving spouse and 
dependent children. 
 
Funding Policy 
 
Contributions are made by governing bodies for the participating departments. No contributions are 
required from the individuals who are members of TESRS, nor are they allowed. The governing 
bodies of each participating department are required to make contributions for each month a member 
performs emergency services for a department (this minimum contribution is $36 per member and 
the department may make a higher monthly contribution for its members). This is referred to as a 
Part One contribution, which is the legacy portion of the TESRS contribution that directly impacts 
future retiree annuities. 
 
The State is required to contribute an amount necessary to make TESRS “actuarially sound” each 
year, which may not exceed one-third of the total of all contributions made by participating 
governing bodies in a particular year. 
 
The Board rule defining contributions was amended effective July 27, 2014 to add the potential for 
actuarially determined Part Two contributions that would be required only if the expected future 
annual contributions from the State are not enough with the Part One contributions to provide an 
adequate contribution arrangement as determined by the most recent actuarial valuation. This Part 
Two portion, which is actuarially determined as a percentage of the Part One portion (not to exceed 
15 percent), is to be actuarially adjusted near the end of each even-numbered calendar year based on 
the most recent actuarial valuation. Based on the actuarial valuation as of August 31, 2018, the Part 
Two contributions were established by the Board to be two percent of the Part One contributions 
beginning September 1, 2019. 
Additional contributions may be made by governing bodies within two years of joining TESRS to 
grant up to ten years of credit for service per member. Prior service purchased must have occurred 
before the department began participation in TESRS. 
 
A small subset of participating departments has a different contribution arrangement that is being 
phased out over time. In this arrangement, contributions made in addition to the monthly 
contributions for active members are made by local governing bodies on a pay-as-you-go basis for 
members who were pensioners when their respective departments merged into TESRS. There is no 
actuarial impact associated with this arrangement as the pay-as-you-go contributions made by these 
governing bodies are always equal to benefit payments paid by TESRS.

Contributions 
 
The contribution requirement per active emergency services personnel member per month is not 
actuarially determined. Rather, the minimum contribution provisions were set by Board rule, and 
there is no maximum contribution rate. For the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018, total 
contributions (dues, prior service, and interest on prior service financing) of $89,400 were paid by 
the City. The State appropriated $1,583,825 for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018 to TESRS as 
a whole. 
 
Actuarial Assumptions

Mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Lives Mortality Tables for males and 
for females projected to 2024 by scale AA. The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 
investments was determined using a building-block method in which expected future net real rates of 
return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for 
each major asset class. These components are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of 
return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage 
(currently 4.97%) and by adding expected inflation (3.00%). In addition, the final 7.75 percent 
assumption reflected a reduction of 0.22 percent for adverse deviation.

Discount Rate  
 
The discount rate used to measure the TPL was 7.75 percent. No projection of cash flows was used 
to determine the discount rate because the August 31, 2018 actuarial valuation showed that expected 
contributions would pay the normal cost and amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability 
(UAAL) in 30 years using the conservative level dollar amortization method. Because of the 30-year 
amortization period with the conservative amortization method and with a lower value of assets, 
TESRS’s fiduciary net position is expected to be available to make all projected future benefit 
payments of current active and inactive members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return 
on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine 
the TPL.

to Pensions 
 
At September 30, 2019, the City reported a liability of $135,099 for its proportionate share of 
TESRS’s NPL.  The amount recognized by the City as its proportionate share of the NPL, the related 
State support, and the total portion of the NPL that was associated with the City were as follows:

*Calculated using the City’s proportionate share of contributions multiplied by the State’s share of 
the collective net pension liability. 
 
The TPL used to calculate the NPL was determined by an actuarial valuation as of August 31, 2016.  
GASB Statement No. 68 requires the NPL to be measured as of a date no earlier than the end of the 
employer’s prior fiscal year.  TESRS did not roll forward (nor did they provide the necessary 
information for the participants to roll forward) the NPL to be measured as of a date no earlier than 
the end of the City’s prior fiscal year.  While the City acknowledges that the measurement date does 
not fall within this 12-month period, the City elected to honor the conservatism principle and report 
an NPL measured as of August 31, 2016.  The City used the assumption that any differences in the 
NPL measured as of August 31, 2016 versus September 30, 2019 would be immaterial.  The 
employer’s proportion of the NPL was based on the employer’s contributions to TESRS relative to 
the contributions of all employers to TESRS for the period September 1, 2015 through August 31, 
2018. 
 
At August 31, 2018, the employer’s proportion of the collective NPL was 1.848 percent, which was 
an increase of 0.304 percent from its proportion measured as of August 31, 2014. 
 
There were no changes of assumptions or other inputs that affected measurement of the TPL during 
the measurement period. 
 
There were no changes of benefit terms that affected measurement of the TPL during the 
measurement period. 
 
For the year ended September 30, 2019, the City recognized pension expense of $37,316.  The City 
recognized on-behalf revenues of $11,886 calculated by taking the State’s total contributions to 
TESRS multiplied by the City’s proportionate share.

Plan Description 
 
The City participates in an OPEB plan administered by TMRS.  TMRS administers the defined 
benefit group-term life insurance plan known as the SDBF. This is a voluntary program in which 
participating member cities may elect, by ordinance, to provide group-term life insurance coverage 
for their active members, including or not including retirees.  Employers may terminate coverage 
under, and discontinue participation in, the SDBF by adopting an ordinance before November 1 of 
any year to be effective the following January 1. 
 
The member city contributes to the SDBF at a contractually required rate (based on the covered 
payroll of employee members) as determined by an annual actuarial valuation. The rate is equal to 
the cost of providing one-year term life insurance. The funding policy for the SDBF program is to 
assure that adequate resources are available to meet all death benefit payments for the upcoming 
year. The intent is not to pre-fund retiree term life insurance during employees’ entire careers. No 
assets are accumulated in a trust that meets the criteria in paragraph 4 of GASB 75.  As such, the 
SDBF is considered to be a single-employer unfunded OPEB defined benefit plan with benefit 
payments treated as being equal to the employer’s yearly contributions for retirees.  
 
The contributions to the SDBF are pooled for investment purposes with those of the Pension Trust 
Fund (PTF). The TMRS Act requires the PTF to allocate a five percent interest credit from 
investment income to the SDBF on an annual basis each December 31 based on the mean balance in 
the SDBF during the year.  
 
Benefits 
 
The death benefit for active employees provides a lump-sum payment approximately equal to the 
employee’s annual salary (calculated based on the employee’s actual earnings, for the 12-month 
period preceding the month of death). The death benefit for retirees is considered an OPEB and is a 
fixed amount of $7,500. As the SDBF covers both active and retiree participants with no segregation 
of assets, the SDBF is considered to be an unfunded OPEB plan (i.e., no assets are accumulated).

Total OPEB Liability 
 
The City’s total OPEB liability of $177,763 was measured as of December 31, 2018 and was 
determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date.  
 
Actuarial Assumptions and Other Inputs 
 
The total OPEB liability in the December 31, 2018 actuarial valuation was determined using the 
following actuarial assumptions and other inputs, applied to all periods included in the measurement, 
unless otherwise specified: 
 
Inflation
2.50%
Salary increases
3.50% to 10.50% including inflation
Discount rate
3.71%*
Retirees' share of benefit-related costs Zero
Administrative expenses
All administrative expenses are paid through the PTF and accounted for under 
reporting requirements under GASB 68.
Mortality rates-service retirees
RP2000 Combined Mortality Table with Blue Collar Adjustment with male rates 
multiplied by 109% and female rates multiplied by 103% and projected on a fully 
generational basis with scale BB.
Mortality rates-disabled retirees
RP2000 Combined Mortality Table with Blue Collar Adjustment with male rates 
multiplied by 109% and female rates multiplied by 103% with a 3-year set-
forward for both males and females. The rate are projected on a fully 
generational basis with scale BB to account for future mortality improvements 
subject to the 3% floor.
 * The discount rate is based on the Fidelity Index's "20-Year Municipal GO AA Index" rate as of December 31, 2018.
 
The actuarial assumptions used in the December 31, 2018 valuation were based on the results of an 
actuarial experience study for the period December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2014.

E.    Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
The City offers its employees a deferred compensation plan (the “Plan”) created in accordance with 
the Internal Revenue Code Section 457.  The Plan, available to all City employees, permits them to 
defer a portion of their salary until future years.  Participation in the Plan is optional.  The Plan’s 
trust arrangements are established to protect deferred compensation amounts of employees under the 
Plan from any other use other than intended under the Plan (eventual payment to employees 
deferring the compensation) in accordance with federal laws.  The deferred compensation is not 
available to employees until termination, retirement, death, or an unforeseeable emergency.  In 
accordance with generally accepted government accounting standards, the assets of the Plan have not 
been included in the City’s financial statements. 
 
F.  Dickinson Education Finance Corporation Conduit Debt 
 
The DEFC issues bonds to finance or refinance educational facilities.  The borrower receives a more 
favorable interest rate and the DEFC receives a fee for issuing these bonds.  These bonds are limited 
obligations of the DEFC since they are payable solely from revenues received from the borrower 
pursuant to a loan agreement by and between the DEFC and the borrower.  The debt is further 
secured by a deed of trust on certain real property of the borrower securing payment under such loan 
agreements.  Therefore, the DEFC has no responsibility for the payment of this debt.  The loan

G.  Chapter 380 Economic Development Agreements 
 
Chapter 380, Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Municipal Planning and Development, of the 
Texas Local Government Code provides the authority to the governing body of a municipality to 
establish and provide for the administration of one or more programs, including programs to 
promote state or local economic development and to stimulate business and commercial activity in 
the municipality.   The City has entered into Chapter 380 Economic Development Agreements (the 
“Agreements”) with five large businesses (the “Businesses”).  Each Business agreed to establish and 
maintain an office in the City that generates substantial taxable sales.  Each Agreement is for a term 
of ten years, and will be automatically extended for two additional ten-year periods.  The City will 
remit back to the Businesses 60 percent of sales tax revenues for the first three to five years, at which 
point the percentage increases to 66.66 percent through the remainder of the Agreements, including 
the two additional ten-year terms.  Each Business is subject to a minimum annual taxable sales 
amount ranging from $5 million to $15 million.  Should any Business fail to meet that threshold, the 
City has the option to terminate the Agreement.   
 
The City has entered into Chapter 380 Economic Development Agreement (the “Agreement”) with 
another business (the “Business”). The Business agreed to establish and maintain an office in the 
City that generates substantial taxable sales. The Agreement is for a term of ten years, and will be 
automatically extended for two additional ten-year periods.  If the taxable sales threshold is met, the 
City will remit back to the Business 50 percent of sales tax revenues collected for that month.  
 
The City entered into a Chapter 380 Economic Development Agreement (the “Agreement”) with 
another business (the “Business”). The Agreement is for a ten-year term. This Business agreed to 
expend no less than $8,000,000 on the construction of a new 85,000 gross square-foot building. This 
Business has also agreed to comply with the employment requirements for entire term of the 
Agreement.  The City will remit back to the Business 50 percent of the real and business personal 
property tax increment. This Business agreed to generate substantial taxable sales. If the taxable 
sales threshold is met, the City agreed to remit 50 percent of the sales tax revenues collected for that 
month.  
 
During the current fiscal year, the City made payments of $3,836,462 related to the Agreements 
noted above. 
 
H.  Hurricane Harvey 
 
Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage in Texas in August 2017.  It was the costliest tropical 
cyclone on record, inflicting an estimated $198.63 billion in damages, making it the costliest natural 
disaster ever in the United States, primarily from widespread flooding in the Houston metropolitan 
area and southeast Texas area. In a four-day period, many areas received more than 40 inches of rain 
as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic 
flooding. With peak accumulations of 64.58 inches, Hurricane Harvey was the wettest tropical 
cyclone on record in the United States. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of 
homes, displaced more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues.  Approximately 
one quarter of the State was impacted by the storm directly or indirectly, including the City.

Mortality - disabled retirees
Other Information:
The discount rate is based on the Fidelity Index's "20-Year Municipal GO AA Index" rate as of December 31, 2018.
There were no benefit changes during the year.
The only change of assumptions was the annual change in the municipal bond index rate. The discount rate used in the development of the total 
OPEB liability was 3.31% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 3.78% as of December 31, 2016.
* Only two years of information are currently available. The City will continue to build this schedule over the next eight-year period.
**Due to the SDBF being considered an unfunded OPEB plan under GASB 75, benefit payments are treated as being equal to the employer's 
yearly contributions for retirees.
All administrative expenses are paid through the PTF and accounted for under reporting 
requirements under GASB 68.
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019
No assets are accumulated in a trust that meets the criteria in paragraph 4 of GASB 75 to pay related benefits.

Management Letter 
May 29, 2020 
To the Honorable Mayor and 
  City Council Members of the 
City of Dickinson, Texas: 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement on Auditing Standards No. 115, 
Communicating Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit (SAS 115), provides guidance to auditors 
on communicating internal control matters to management and the governing body, board of directors, or 
equivalent body.   
It is important to note when reviewing findings reported within this letter that classification of the findings is 
based on the definitions required by SAS 115 as further discussed below.  Please note that these classifications are 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements, not necessarily the likelihood of actual loss to the City.  
Accordingly, the City’s assessment of the “significance” or ranking of severity will likely be substantially 
different based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, its assessment of risk and the cost benefit of 
making the change.  
Our report is as follows: 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type 
activities, the discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund 
information of the City of Dickinson, Texas (the “City”) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019, in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, we considered the City’s 
internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing our auditing procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control. 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the preceding paragraph and was 
not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant 
deficiencies and, therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. 
However, as discussed below, we identified certain deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be 
significant deficiencies and other matters. 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements 
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.

Management Letter

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe 
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our findings and additional comments are as follows: 
 
CURRENT YEAR MATTERS 
 
Significant Deficiencies: 
 
2019-001. DEFICIT IN CASH BALANCE 
 
Criteria 
 
The City should ensure that there are adequate funds available in the pooled cash account to satisfy the equity 
interest of all financial reporting funds. 
 
Condition 
 
Deficit cash balances were not being identified and/or brought to positive balance. 
 
Effect 
 
As of the end of the year, several funds reported negative cash balances totaling $691,263. 
 
Cause 
 
Deficit in cash balances are not being monitoring by management. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The City should consider adopting a formal policy on how deficit balances will be communicated to management 
and City Council and if formal approval will be obtained before or after a fund has a negative balance.  
 
Managements Response 
 
The City will put into place policies and procesdures to ensure a regular reconciliation of cash balances. 
 
2019-002.  DUE TO AND DUE FROM BALANCES 
 
Criteria 
 
The City should ensure the appropriate use and accurate recording of all interfund transactions. 
 
Condition 
 
It was noted during the audit that cash collected in the general fund bank account was transferred to the same 
general fund in several due to accounts.  
 
Effect 
 
As a result of the lack of procedures, it was difficult to agree activity between funds.  
DRAFT
City of Dickinson, Texas  
Management Letter 
Page 3 of 5 
 
Cause 
 
The City has not established procedures in which management reviews and reconciles interfund activity. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The City should transfer the cash collected for other funds on a quarterly basis to the respective funds. 
 
Managements Response 
 
The City will put into place policies and procesdures to ensure a regular reconciliation of interfund activity. 
 
2019-003.  EDC BANK ACCOUNT 
 
Criteria 
 
The City should ensure the appropriate application of policies and procedures regarding the use of bank accounts. 
 
Condition 
 
It was noted during the audit that there was no formal policy or procedure currently in place with regards to the

Required Auditor Disclosure Letter 
May 27, 2020 
To the Honorable Mayor and 
    City Council Members of the 
City of Dickinson, Texas: 
We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the discretely 
presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the City of 
Dickinson, Texas  (the “City”) for the year ended September 30, 2019.  Professional standards require that we 
provide the City Council (the “governing body”) with information about our responsibilities under generally 
accepted auditing standards (and, if applicable, Government Auditing Standards and the Uniform Guidance), as 
well as certain information related to the planned scope and timing of our audit. 
I. Our Responsibility under U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards
As stated in our engagement letter dated September 10, 2018, our responsibility, as described by professional 
standards, is to express opinions about whether the financial statements prepared by management with the 
governing body’s oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles.  Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve the governing body or 
management of its responsibilities. 
II. Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit
We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timing previously communicated to the governing 
body in our engagement letter dated September 10, 2018. 
III. Significant Audit Findings
1. Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices
A. Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant
accounting policies used by the City are described in the notes to the financial statements.  No new
accounting policies were adopted and the application of existing policies was not changed during the year.
We noted no transactions entered into by the City during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative
guidance or consensus.  All significant transactions have been recognized in the financial statements in
the proper period.

Required Auditor Disclosure Letter 
B. Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are
based on management’s knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about 
future events.  Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the 
financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ 
significantly from those expected.  The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements were:  
Management’s estimate of the useful lives of capital assets is based on industry standards 
relating to capital assets.  We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop 
the useful lives of capital assets in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the 
financial statements taken as a whole. 
Estimates are used in the calculation of the pension liability and the required annual 
contribution.  The Texas Municipal Retirement System (TMRS) hires a licensed actuary 
to make key assumptions and to perform calculations, as well as an independent auditor 
to review those assumptions and calculations.  We evaluated the reasonableness of the 
employee data provided by the City to TMRS. 
Estimates are used in the calculation of the health care liability for other postemployment 
benefits. The City hires a licensed actuary to perform the calculation.  We evaluated the 
key factors and assumptions used to develop the liability in relation to the financial 
statements taken as a whole. 
C. The financial statements disclosures are neutral, consistent, and clear.  Certain financial statement
disclosures are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users.  The most
sensitive disclosure affecting the financial statements was:
The disclosure of long-term debt in the financial statements is significant to financial 
statement users because it discloses the City’s long-term financial obligations. 
2. Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit
We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management in performing and completing our audit. 
3. Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements
Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the audit, 
other than those that are clearly trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. 
Management has corrected all such misstatements.  The attached schedule summarizes both material and 
immaterial misstatements detected as a result of our audit procedures. 
4. Disagreements with Management
For purposes of this letter, a disagreement with management is a financial accounting, reporting, or auditing 
matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the financial statements or the 
auditors’ report.  We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose during the course of our audit. 
5. Management Representations
We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management representation 
letter dated May 27, 2020.

6. Management Consultations with Other Independent Accountants 
In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting matters, 
similar to obtaining a “second opinion” on certain situations.  If a consultation involves application of an 
accounting principle to the City’s financial statements or a determination of the type of auditors’ opinion that may 
be expressed on those statements, our professional standards require the consulting accountant to check with us to 
determine that the consultant has all the relevant facts.  To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with 
other accountants. 
7. Other Audit Findings or Issues
We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing 
standards, with management each year prior to retention as the City’s auditors.  However, these discussions 
occurred in the normal course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our 
retention. 
IV. Other Matters
We applied certain limited procedures to the Required Supplementary Information (RSI), as identified on the 
table of contents, which supplements the basic financial statements. Our procedures consisted of inquiries of 
management regarding the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency 
with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained 
during our audit of the basic financial statements. We did not audit the RSI and do not express an opinion or 
provide any assurance on the RSI. 
We were engaged to report on the supplementary information, as identified on the table of contents, which 
accompanies the financial statements but is not RSI. With respect to this supplementary information, we made 
certain inquiries of management and evaluated the form, content, and methods of preparing the information to 
determine that the information complies with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior period, and the information is appropriate and 
complete in relation to our audit of the financial statements.  We compared and reconciled the supplementary 
information to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial 
statements themselves. 
We were not engaged to report on the introductory information, which accompanies the financial statements but is 
not RSI. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic 
financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it. 
V. Restrictions on Use
This information is intended solely for the use of the Mayor, City Council, and management and is not intended to 
be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these specified parties.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 
May 29, 2020 
To the Honorable Mayor and 
  City Council Members of the 
City of Dickinson, Texas: 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America 
and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-
type activities, the discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund 
information of the City of Dickinson, Texas (the “City”), as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements and 
have issued our report thereon dated May 29, 2020. 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the City’s internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 
for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the City’s internal control. 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the preceding paragraph and was 
not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant 
deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. 
However, as described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs, we identified certain 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be significant deficiencies. 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in 
internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those 
charged with governance. We consider items 2019.001 through 2019.006 to be significant deficiencies. 
DRAFT
4 
Compliance and Other Matters 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the City’s financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and 
grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of 
financial statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an 
objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no 
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing 
Standards. 
Purpose of this Report 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the City’s internal control or on 
compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing 
Standards in considering the City’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not 
suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON 
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE, AND 
THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 
May 29, 2020 
To the Honorable Mayor and 
  City Council Members of the 
City of Dickinson, Texas: 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited the City of Dickinson, Texas’ (the “City”) compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each 
of the City’s major federal programs for the year ended September 30, 2019.  The City’s major federal programs 
are identified in the summary of auditors’ results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and 
questioned costs.   
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its 
federal awards applicable to its federal programs.   
Auditors’ Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the City’s major federal programs based on 
our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable 
to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those 
standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a 
direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence about the City’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances.   
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the City’s compliance. 
DRAFT
6 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, the City complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the 
year ended September 30, 2019. 
Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
Management of the City is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered the City’s internal control over compliance with the types of 
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the 
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the City’s internal control over compliance.  
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by Uniform Guidance 
We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the 
discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of 
the City, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019, and the related notes to the financial 
statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements.  We have issued our report 
thereon dated May 29, 2020, which contained unmodified opinions on those financial statements.  Our 
audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is 
presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required 
part of the basic financial statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was 
derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic 
financial statements.  The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit 
of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial 
statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.

CITY OF DICKINSON, TEXAS 
SUMMARY SCHEDULE OF PRIOR AUDIT FINDINGS 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
8 
Significant Deficiencies: 
2018.001. POOLED CASH BALANCE 
Background  
The City uses a consolidated bank account; whereas, one bank account is maintained for all funds and 
each fund has an equity interest in the bank account.  While consolidated bank accounts are highly 
efficient due to the automated nature, there is no formal approval necessary to advance funds to cover a 
shortage when a fund’s equity in the bank account becomes a deficit.   
Criteria 
The City should ensure all equity in pooled cash accounts is properly recorded. 
Condition 
Pooled cash equity accounts were not being reconciled and/or adjusted. 
Effect 
The balance of the pooled cash account in fund 99 did not agree with the total amount of the cash 
accounts that comprise this account. 
Cause 
Turnover of accounting personnel and resulting crises management. 
Recommendation 
Fund 99 should be reconciled monthly to ensure that the sum of the claim on cash accounts of the other 
funds match with the corresponding account balance.  
2018.002. DEFICIT IN CASH BALANCE 
Criteria 
The City should ensure that there are adequate funds available in the pooled cash account to satisfy the 
equity interest of all financial reporting funds. 
Condition 
Deficit cash balances were not being identified and/or brought to positive balance. 
Effect 
As of the end of the year, several funds reported negative cash balances totaling $691,263. 
Cause 
Deficits in cash balances are not being monitoring by management. 
DRAFT
CITY OF DICKINSON, TEXAS 
SUMMARY SCHEDULE OF PRIOR AUDIT FINDINGS 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
9 
 
Recommendation 
 
The City should consider adopting a formal policy on how deficit balances will be communicated to 
management and City Council and if formal approval will be obtained before or after a fund has a 
negative balance.  
 
2018.003.  JOURNAL ENTRIES 
 
Criteria 
 
The City should ensure that there are adequate internal controls over the posting of journal entries. 
 
Condition 
 
During review and testing of journal entries, it was noted that several adjustments were made incorrectly 
or made as corrections for other adjustments. 
  
Effect 
 
The lack of management oversight of the journal entry process could increase the risk of misstated 
account balances. 
 
Cause 
 
The City has not established procedures for the review of journal entries by management.  
 
Recommendation 
 
The City should restrict an employee’s ability to both enter and verify journal entries. The authorization 
of journal entries should be performed by management. With review of journal entries, there will be less 
chance for incorrect entries to occur. 
 
2018.004.  DUE TO AND DUE FROM BALANCES 
 
Criteria 
 
The City should ensure the appropriate use and accurate recording of all interfund transactions. 
 
Condition 
 
It was noted during the audit that cash collected in the general fund bank account was transferred to the 
same general fund in several due to accounts.  
 
Effect 
 
As a result of the lack of procedures, it was difficult to agree activity between funds.  
 
Cause 
 
The City has not established procedures in which management reviews and reconciles interfund activity.

CITY OF DICKINSON, TEXAS 
SUMMARY SCHEDULE OF PRIOR AUDIT FINDINGS 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019 
10 
Recommendation 
 
The City should transfer the cash collected for other funds on a quarterly basis to the respective funds. 
 
2018.005.  CASH DEPOSITS 
 
Criteria 
 
The City should ensure that there are adequate controls and monitoring procedures over the deposit of 
cash collected.  
 
Condition 
 
It was noted during the audit that eight deposits were not deposited in a timely manner, the longest taking 
seven days after receipt to be deposited.  
 
Effect 
 
The lack of monitoring of the daily deposits leads to the noncompliance of the City’s cash handling 
policy, as well as increases the risk of loss from fire, theft, or misappropriation. 
 
Cause 
 
Cash was not deposited daily as required by the City’s cash handling policy.  
 
Recommendation 
 
The City should make deposits daily. 
 
2018.006.  BANK ACCOUNT RECONCILIATION 
 
Criteria 
 
The City should ensure that there are adequate internal controls over cash. 
 
Condition 
 
The bank reconciliation for the Hurricane Relief Fund has two outstanding items with the description of 
“check bank cleared twice” suggesting that the reconciliation either has an error or questionable 
uncorrected activity.   
 
Effect 
 
Lack of adequate internal controls could increase the risk of misappropriation of assets. 
 
Cause 
 
The City has not established procedures for the review of bank reconciliations by management. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The City should review the nature of these items and make any necessary adjustment.

that need to be removed. Mr. Heard said that the City has 
approximately 2,200 such trash cans and that the extra thirty will be 
added to the list for removal.

whether it had started. Mr. Heard said that former Finance Director

why the item was not included. Mayor Masters said that she did not 
allow it. Council Member Suderman said that he had later changed his 
mind anyway. Council Member Deats lamented that having to write 
such a letter was even necessary. 
• Condolences to the Preston family on the loss of their 20-year old son. 
• On May 22, 300 gallons of free milk was distributed by Borden. The 
free milk will be available every Friday through August. Families can

speaker. 
 
 
Gregory Castellanos, 2322 Pecan Drive, Dickinson, Texas – Mr. Castellano 
had asked for an agenda item to discuss his desire to build a carport on his 
property. He had built the carport before being informed by the City that it 
did not comply with City Codes, so he had to take it down. Mr. Castellanos 
has lived at the house for over thirty years, which had to be rebuilt after 
Hurricane Harvey. Without the carport, he said, the house no longer feels 
like his home. The street is a working-class neighborhood, several of his 
neighbors have carports, and Mr. Castellanos has a list of signatures from 
his neighbors in support of his project. Mayor Masters said that staff will 
speak to Mr. Castellanos after the meeting.

on the purchase.

REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM TO THE TEXAS STATE LIBRARY 
AND 
ARCHIVES 
COMISSION; 
AND 
PROVIDING 
FOR 
INCORPORATION OF PREABMLE AND AN EFFECTIVE DATE. 
 
BACKGROUND:   
The Texas State Library and Archives Commission (TSLAC) provides 
partial reimbursement for direct, out-of-pocket costs associated with 
participating in statewide resource sharing such as postage, courier, 
and shipping materials.  
 
The reimbursements pertain to lends made during TSLAC’s SFY2020, 
August 1, 2019 – July 31, 2020. While dispersed after the end of 
SFY2020, the reimbursement payments do need to be applied to costs 
associated with resource sharing costs expended during SFY2020. 
 
This is a noncompetitive grant. Recipients will receive a reimbursement 
based on the number of lends provided to other libraries during 
SFY2020. In FY2019 libraries were given $9.00 per lend.  Dickinson 
Public Library received a reimbursement of $3,951 for FY2019. The 
amount received per lend in FY2020 will depend on the number of 
eligible applicants.  The total amount the Library will receive will be 
determined in October. 
 
There is no requirement for cost sharing, matching funds, or cost 
participation with this program. 
 
RECOMMENDATION:    Staff recommends approval of the Resolution.

Page 2 of 21 
 
Section 2.   Ordinance Number 734-2011, duly passed and approved by the   City 
Council of the City of Dickinson, Texas, on November 8, 2011, and codified as Article V, 
Flood Hazard Areas, of Chapter 14, Planning and Development, of the Code of  
Ordinances of the City of Dickinson is hereby repealed in its entirety. 
Section 3.   Chapter 14, Planning and Development, of the Code of Ordinances of 
the City of Dickinson is hereby amended by the adoption of a new Article V, Flood 
Damage Prevention and Protection, to read in its entirety as follows: 
 
 
ARTICLE V. – FLOOD DAMGE PREVENTION AND PROTECTION 
 
DIVISION 1. – GENERALLY 
Sec. 14-1. – Statutory Authority. 
The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, 
Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations 
designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Dickinson, Texas does 
ordain this article. 
Sec. 14-2. – Findings of Fact. 
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Dickinson are subject to periodic inundation, which 
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and 
governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and 
relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
 
B. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains 
which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood 
hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are 
inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
Sec. 14-3. – Purpose 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and 
to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions 
designed to: 
1. Protect human life and health; 
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
CITY OF DICKINSON, TEXAS – ORDINANCE NUMBER XXX-2020 
Page 3 of 21 
 
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electrical, 
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
6. Help maintain a stable tax base providing for the sound use and development of flood- 
prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
7. Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
Sec. 14-4. – Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following 
methods:

using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of 
this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist 
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but 
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This 
requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements 
for resisting wind forces. 
b. All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with subsection (1) above. 
c. Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved 
within Zones AI-30, AH and AE on the FIRM on sites outside of a Manufactured 
Home Park or Subdivision, in a new Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision, in 
an expansion to an existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision, or in an 
existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision on which a manufactured  home 
has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent 
foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is eighteen (18) 
inches above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately 
anchored foundation system in accordance with this paragraph. 
5. Recreational Vehicles – All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, 
and AE on the FIRM shall either: 
a. Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;

Page 18 of 21 
 
b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c. Meet the permit requirements, including elevation and anchoring requirements, 
for manufactured homes in this article. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is 
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no 
permanently attached additions. 
Sec. 14-43. – Standards for Subdivision Proposals 
1. All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be 
consistent with sections 14-3 and 14-4. 
2. All proposals for the development of subdivisions including manufactured home parks 
and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of section 14-24, section 
14-25, and the provisions of this division. 
3. Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed 
development including manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 
50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 14-
21 or section 14-25. 
4. All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have 
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
5. All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have 
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and 
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
6. The special flood hazard area (SFHA) boundary and any Base Flood Elevation for the 
building site(s) on each lot shall be clearly marked on all recorded subdivision plats and 
approved site development plans. 
Sec. 14-44. – Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
Located within the areas of Special Flood Hazard established in section 14-21 are areas 
designated as shallow flooding. These areas have Special Flood Hazards associated with base 
flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where 
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is 
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the 
lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least  
CITY OF DICKINSON, TEXAS – ORDINANCE NUMBER XXX-2020 
Page 19 of 21 
 
eighteen (18) inches above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two 
(2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent 
grade at least eighteen (18) inches above the depth number specified in feet on 
the FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below 
the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, the structure is watertight up to 
eighteen (18) inches above the Base Flood Elevation – Regulatory with walls 
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural 
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads 
of effects of buoyancy. 
3. A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the 
Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 14-25 
are satisfied. 
4. Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to 
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
Sec. 14-45. – Floodways. 
Floodways located within areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 14-21 are areas 
designated as Floodways. Since the Floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity 
of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, Encroachments 
are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other 
development within a flood hazard area. 
Sec. 14-46. – Standards for Areas in Zone X (Shaded) 
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures 
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least eighteen (18) inches above the 
highest adjacent grade or six (6) inches above the crown of the street, whichever is greater, when 
the street is in the path of water egress from the site. 
Sec. 14-47. – Standards for Areas in Approximate A Zones 
All New construction and substantial improvement of any residential and nonresidential 
Structures in an Approximate A Zone shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated 
to a minimum of eighteen (18) inches above the Base Flood Elevation – Regulatory as determined 
by an Elevation Certificate provided by a registered engineer, architect, or surveyor.

MEETING DATE:

TOPIC:   
BRIEFING, DISCUSSION AND DIRECTION CONCERNING: 
Proposed Calendar and Process for Creating the FY2021 
Budget 
 
BACKGROUND:   
As required by the City Charter and State Law, the City will 
prepare a financial budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This 
budget will encompass all operating funds of the City and a plan 
for Capital Improvements in upcoming years. The budget will give 
realistic forecasts of revenues and anticipated expenditures.  
 
At this time, there does not appear to be reason to anticipate 
major fluctuations in the revenue sources. As a result, the 
departments generally will be asked to maintain operations at or 
near the current level. Requests for new programs or new 
personnel will be considered but will need to include funding 
sources.  
 
The Council will be briefed on all department budgets and given 
an opportunity to ask questions and give input for the coming year 
before being asked to vote on the proposed budget in September.  
 
 
RECOMMENDATION:    Staff requests Council Members review their personal plans in 
relation to the proposed Budget Calendar and communicate 
conflicts to the Mayor or City Administrator.
