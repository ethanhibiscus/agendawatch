to review the proposed changes and provide staff direction on which requests should be reviewed and brought
back with a recommendation. At that time, the Commission and Council identified items that they would like
staff to analyze and bring back for further discussion and items that would not be considered as part of this
annual update. For specific amendments, the Commission and Council also provided additional direction and
items that should be considered in staff’s analysis.
In November 2019, the Planning and Zoning Commission reviewed and provided a recommendation on
proposed Phase 1 amendments which consisted of typos and technical errors, policy items that the joint
committee directed be expedited at the June 2019 workshop, and amendments related to House Bills
approved during the 2019 Legislative Session. These amendments were reviewed at the December 3rd City
Council meeting and approved upon second reading at the December 17th City Council meeting.
At this time, City staff is presenting amendments proposed by City Engineering staff and several City Boards
and Commissions. These amendments and their timing are in alignment with staff’s recommendation at the
June 2019 workshop the proposed next steps discussed during the Commission’s review and action on Phase
1 amendments.
In addition to these amendments already discussed at the workshop and during Phase 1,
staff is presenting amendments related to policy items that have been expedited at the request of the City
Council, additional needed amendments identified by Planning & Development staff since Phase 1, and
amendments in response to a developer request.
Section 2.4.1.3 of the San Marcos Development Code requires the Planning & Zoning Commission to make a
recommendation regarding the text amendment(s) to the City Council.  Below is a summary of the process
and key dates.

1. City Engineering Staff Recommendations 
2. Alcohol Conditional Use Permit Committee, Housing Task Force, and Historic 
Preservation Commission Recommendations 
3. Additional Amendments Identified by Staff Since June 2019 Workshop  
4. Developer Request for Special Events Facility Use  
5. Policy Items Expedited at the Request of Council  
 
Summary and Background 
In April 2018, the City of San Marcos adopted the San Marcos Development Code, which was 
developed through the multi-year CODE SMTX process.  Beginning in March 2019, Planning & 
Development staff began conducting public outreach in support of the annual Land Development 
Code update. Staff provided a request form on the City’s website where interested parties could 
submit their proposed change and the purpose behind their request. Staff shared the online request 
form and code update schedule via an initial e-mail notification and also in person at the regular 
meetings of the Downtown Association, Historic Preservation Commission, Neighborhood 
Commission, Parks Board, and Planning and Zoning Commission. After an additional reminder e-mail 
to those on the City’s notification list, the request form was closed on May 7th.   
 
A joint workshop between the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council was held in June 
2019. The purpose of the workshop was to allow City Council and the Planning and Zoning Commission 
the opportunity to review the proposed changes and provide staff direction on which requests should 
be reviewed and brought back with a recommendation. At that time, the Commission and Council 
identified items that they would like staff to analyze and bring back for further discussion and items 
that would not be considered as part of this annual update. For specific amendments, the Commission 
and Council also provided additional direction and items that should be considered in staff’s analysis. 
 
In November 2019, the Planning and Zoning Commission reviewed and provided a recommendation 
on proposed Phase 1 amendments which consisted of typos and technical errors, policy items that the 
joint committee directed be expedited at the June 2019 workshop, and amendments related to House 
Bills approved during the 2019 Legislative Session. These amendments were reviewed at the 
December 3rd City Council meeting and approved upon second reading at the December 17th City 
Council meeting.  
 
At this time, City staff is presenting amendments proposed by City Engineering staff and several City 
Boards and Commissions. These amendments and their timing are in alignment with staff’s 
recommendation at the June 2019 workshop where the proposed next steps were discussed.  In 
addition to these amendments already discussed at the workshop and during Phase 1, staff is 
presenting amendments related to policy items that have been expedited at the request of City 
Council, additional needed amendments identified by Planning & Development staff since Phase 1, 
and amendments in response to a developer request.

Block Measurement
1.
A block is bounded by a public right-of-way, not including an alley. All public rights-of-way proposed in order to meet the 
block standards must be improved with a street.
2.
Block perimeter is measured along the edge of the property adjoining the public right-of-way, except for the measurement 
of dead-end streets, which are measured from intersecting centerlines.
3.
The maximum block perimeter may be extended by fifty (50%) percent where the block includes a pedestrian passage, 
shared street, or an alley in accordance with Section 3.7.2.6 that connects the two (2) streets on opposing block faces. 
Pedestrian passages and alleys may connect dead-end streets.
4.
A block may be broken by a civic building or open lot, provided the lot is at least fifty (50) feet wide and deep and provides a 
pedestrian passage meeting the requirements of Section 3.7.2.6 that directly connects the two (2) streets on each block face.
5.
Within a single phase of any subdivision or development, individual block perimeters may exceed the maximum by twenty 
five (25%) percent provided that the average of all block perimeters in the phase does not exceed the maximum.
6.
The Responsible Official may waive the block perimeter requirements or maximum dead-end street length consistent with 
Section 3.6.2.1 when steep slopes in excess of twenty five (25%) percent, freeways, waterways, railroad lines, preexisting 
development, tree conservation areas, stream buffers, cemeteries, open space or easements would make the provision of a 
complete block infeasible or does not advance the intent of this Article.
7.
Where the block pattern is interrupted by a natural obstruction or public parkland, including greenways, that is open and 
accessible to the public, pedestrian access points shall be provided with a minimum spacing equal to one half (½) of the 
maximum block perimeter.
8.
A larger block perimeter may be permitted for HI zoned lots with a building that exceeds 200,000 square feet. The block
perimeter shall not exceed the lot area required to meet parking and landscaping provisions for the individual structure.

DIVISION 1:  BUILDING TYPES 
Section 4.2.1.1   Building Types Established 
The following building types have been established to allow for detailed regulation of the form within each zoning district. 
House: 
A medium to large detached single family structure that incorporates one unit. Typically located within a primarily single-family 
residential neighborhood in a more rural or suburban setting. If located within a walkable neighborhood, this building type is 
typically located at the edge of the neighborhood, providing a transition to the more rural areas. 
Cottage: 
A medium to small sized detached structure that incorporates one unit. Typically located within a primarily residential neighborhood 
in a walkable urban setting, potentially near a neighborhood main street.  In its smaller size, this type can enable appropriately-
scaled, well-designed affordable housing at higher densities and is important for providing a broad choice of housing types and 
promoting walkability.

APPENDIX C-HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES 
ARTICLE 5: STANDARDS FOR GUIDELINES FOR SUSTAINABILITY 
Section C.5.1.1 Purpose 
A. Before implementing any energy conservation measures to enhance the sustainability of a historic building, the existing energy-
efficient characteristics of the building should be assessed. The key to a successful rehabilitation project is to identify and 
understand any lost original and existing energy-efficient aspects of the historic building, as well as to identify and understand its 
character-defining features to ensure they are preserved. The most sustainable building may be one that already exists. Thus, good 
preservation practice is often synonymous with sustainability. There are numerous treatments—traditional as well as new 
technological innovations—that may be used to upgrade a historic building to help it operate even more efficiently. Whether a 
historic building is rehabilitated for a new or a continuing use, it is important to utilize the building’s inherently-sustainable qualities 
as they were intended. It is equally important that they function effectively together with any new measures undertaken to further 
improve energy efficiency. The following guidelines offer specific guidance on how to make historic buildings more sustainable in a 
manner that will preserve their historic character.

Written Public Hearing Statement for Item 4 Code Updates // 05.12.2020 P&Z Meeting 
 
To the San Marcos Planning & Zoning Commission: 
 
As you consider recommendations for text amendments to the Land Development Code this 
evening (Agenda item 4), I urge you to remove and defer any items that have policy implications 
on housing and transportation in San Marcos to later phases of the code update as associated 
with the Comprehensive Plan rewrite and the Strategic Housing Action Plan.  
 
As outlined by staff, any code updates to follow after the current Phase 2 items before you this 
evening are to include “all items which would have a policy implication” and are to be postponed 
until a new “Comprehensive Plan and city-wide visions and goals are adopted.” Policy changes 
should be determined holistically and by the community any time the comprehensive plan is 
updated. Addressing them piecemeal and outside of this process undermines the integrity of the 
comp plan vision and negates collective community input.  
 
Please honor and acknowledge the process outlined by staff - as well as the many years of 
collective input that went into Vision San Marcos and the resulting land development code that 
was just recently adopted - and pull the items that will have major impacts on housing 
affordability and sustainable transportation policy.  ​In the chart titled Exhibit A, I strongly 
recommend these to include items 14, 23, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, and 38 (attached and 
highlighted on the following pages, as well).  
 
Please defer these items to the comprehensive plan rewrite or to further action with the strategic 
housing action plan so that the community and associated focus boards can collectively 
determine direction on these and maintain the integrity of the current code and comp plan. 
These items have serious policy implications and will negatively impact housing affordability, 
sustainable transportation progress, and the holistic environmental vision as laid out in the 
Vision San Marcos. To include these items in any set of recommendations this evening will 
undermine the housing committee’s work as well as the integrity of past and future 
comprehensive plans.  
 
Thank you for your review of these and any other items you see to have policy implications.

Major policy change. Adds significant time and 
expense barriers to small scale infill projects in 
existing neighborhoods. Removing corridor-based 
language undermines vision san marcos intent. 
Major housing policy change. Eliminating ADUs by right 
goes against intent of code to allow incremental, small 
scale development / missing middle housing built by 
typical home owner. Already have requirement for primary 
house to be owner-occupied, piling on additional barriers 
to ADU creation.
Major transportation (and environmental) policy change. Leads to 
increased impervious cover and underutilized assets of public on 
street parking in neighborhoods; barrier to small scale development 
Major transportation / parking policy change. Main Street advisory board 
made a recommendation to keep this in to enable more adaptive reuse of 
existing buildings downtown for housing vs. bulldozing or letting them sit 
vacant; and to increase small scale housing projects downtown. 
Major housing and transportation policy change. CD2 is rural and CD3 is 
low density housing. By creating a CD2.5 equivalent to legacy districts, 
undermines intent of vision san marcos to create improved development 
patterns that help conserve natural lands.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed Changes to the San Marcos Development Code 
 
Good evening, 
 
I served on the committee that helped develop our Land Development Code and I would like to 
address some of the proposed amendments to that code. I will be brief: 
 
Section    Summary                                    My comment 
3.6.2.1    Increase ETJ max block perim.   These areas may eventually be annexed and should 
be                                                                     held to standards that we would want within the 
city. 
 
4.4.2.2    Add ND-3.2 zoning                    This is unnecessary and complicates the Code. 
 
4.3.4.5    C across from established           "Established residential" includes multi-story MF 
                 limited to 1-story                        so this would not be appropriate. Setbacks would 
be                                                                      better solution. 
 
5.1.1.2  Change by right to CUP for ADU    This violates the original intent of the Code. There 
is                                                                         no reason ADUs should be under different 
oversight                                                                         from houses or apartments. 
 
4.4.3.3    Add CD 2.3                                    This is unnecessary and complicates the Code. 
 
 
Thank you for your consideration, 
Betsy Robertson

Phase 2 Code Amendments
Consider a recommendation to the City Council regarding text amendments to the San Marcos 
Development Code to address recommendations from the Alcohol Conditional Use Permit 
Committee, the Housing Task Force, the Historic Preservation Commission, and recommendations 
from City staff concerning application processing and requirements, block perimeter standards, 
Certificate of Appropriateness appeals, Concept Plat applicability, right-of-way dimensional standards, 
building type definitions, Neighborhood Density District zoning regulations, Character District zoning 
regulations, a new Special Events Facility use, multifamily parking standards, accessory dwelling units, 
neighborhood transitions, durable building materials, detention and water quality requirements for 
plats of four residential lots or less, detention requirements outside the Urban Stormwater 
Management District, delineation of water quality and buffer zones, channel design for water quality 
zone reclamation, sensitive geologic feature protection zones, geological assessment waivers, and 
Qualified Watershed Protection Plan applicability, and adoption of Appendix Q of the International 
Residential Code (S. Caldwell)
sanmarcostx.gov
Expand Administrative Approval Ability 
For Qualified Watershed Protection Plans
What is a Qualified Watershed Protection Plan (QWPP)?
•
QWPP’s are required for developments that

Reclaim floodplain, water quality, and/or buffer zones

Request to increase impervious cover requiring mitigation

Development of 20 acres or more of land within the floodplain
•
QWPP’s must comply with environmental chapter and Flood 
Damage Prevention Ordinance and include mitigation measures. 
•
P&Z approves QWPP’s
1 & 9
sanmarcostx.gov
Expand Administrative Approval Ability 
For Qualified Watershed Protection Plans
Reason for Change: 
•
Criteria for approval is a technical assessment that allows limited 
discretionary direction by P&Z.  Need for additional P&Z approval 
has been questioned.
Proposed Revision:  Previous mitigation measures as part of QWPP are 
now required in code.
•
Reclamation must be accomplished in a way that preserves the 
natural function and aesthetic of original waterway. 
•
TSS removal requirement for increase in impervious cover or water 
quality and buffer zone reclamation.
•
QWPP’s come before P&Z when mitigation proposed varies from 
code requirements.

Fee-in-Lieu of Detention & Exemption to 
Water Quality Treatment Requirement
For Platting 4 or Less Lots in Single Family
Residential Zoning Districts
Reason for Change:  Reduce cost of single family home development 
meeting minor plat requirements.  
Proposed Revision: Required to pay fee-in lieu of detention and 
incorporate disconnected impervious cover and vegetated filter strips 
(TCEQ approved stormwater treatment method).  Must show no 
impacts downstream.

sanmarcostx.gov
Fee-in-Lieu of Detention and Water Quality
For Significantly Constrained Sites Outside Urban 
Stormwater Management District
Proposed 
Building
Reason for Change:  Provide flexibility for sites that have extreme 
difficulty meeting detention and water quality requirements on-site.
Proposed Revision: Provide Fee-In-Lieu option.  Must show no impacts 
downstream.

Reason for Change: Code language results in very narrow protection

Incorporate Natural Channel Design 
for Water Quality Reclamations
Reason for Change:  Waterways outside Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone 
can be channelized and rerouted to accommodate site development.
Proposed Revision: Reclamation must be accomplished in a way that 
preserves the natural function and aesthetic of original waterway.

sanmarcostx.gov
Waiver of Geologic Assessment
Within Transition Zone
Reason for Change: 
•
Geologic Assessments (GA’s) in the Transition Zone was a new 
requirement added in the 2018 code update.
•
Some areas within Transition Zone have very low likelihood of 
having geologic features (Houston Black Clay areas near eastern 
edge of Transition Zone). 
Proposed Revision:
•
Not require GA’s in proposed Exemption Area (approximately 36% 
of Transition Zone) developed through collaboration with registered 
geologist.
•
Code still requires investigation of geologic features discovered 
during construction in GA Exempted Area and allows for protection 
if determined to be sensitive.

obstacleto diverse housing types. 
Proposed Revision: Removes obstacles to encourage diverse housing types 
and infill development
15

Make pre-development meetings mandatory unless waived 
by Responsible Official
Reason for Change: Provide developer with all the needed information and 
processes early on. Creates a clear record of procedural requirements for the 
applicant and staff. 
Proposed Revision: Require pre-development meeting unless application

such application does not warrant a meeting, or if alternative measures have been taken 
to address concerns and/or questions that may arise out of the application. No 
application shall be accepted for filing at a pre-development meeting. A pre-
development meeting is voluntary, and thus does not trigger any grandfathering rights or 
commence a review period.

amount of right of way be constructed for simple, 1-2 lot developments
Proposed Revision: Decreases excessive dedication and construction 
requirement while still maintaining connectivity
23
sanmarcostx.gov
31
Provide alternative block perimeter standards for HI 
zoned lots
Reason for Change: Standard that has commonly been identified as 
problematic and not feasible during economic development incentive 
negotiations

restrictions to CD-3 
zoning district

occupancy of each unit to a 
family + one not related by 
blood, adoption, marriage, or 
conservatorship
26
sanmarcostx.gov
34
Provide better definition for “house” and “cottage”
Reason for Change: The building types are the same. Both building types are not 
needed and overlap in definitions is confusion to the reader. 
Proposed Revision: Clarifies that lot dimensional standards and context of 
surrounding neighborhood, not the building type, will determine the size and scale 
of the home.

functions and celebrations. Requires minimum parcel size, protective yard, on site 
parking, compliance with noise ordinance, and consideration of adjacent single 
family residential uses. Prohibits a TABC license.
