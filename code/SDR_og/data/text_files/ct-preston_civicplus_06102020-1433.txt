We need everyone to understand the importance of being muted so that background noise is not disruptive.
 
If you dialed in by phone, use your phone’s ‘Mute’ button if you have one.   If you do not have a mute button, 
use your phone keypad:  *6 – to mute or unmute yourself.  (If you are interested in learning more, a full list of 
commands is available to you by using your phone keypad and pressing *4 to hear those commands.)
If you connected electronically, press the ‘microphone’ and when the icon is green, you are connected and 
unmuted.   To mute, press again and when it is red with a slash mark over the mic, you are muted.  Green is 
ON- unmuted / Red is OFF- muted. Same applies for when you phone in, yet you will see a phone icon:  Green 
is on / Red is off.
