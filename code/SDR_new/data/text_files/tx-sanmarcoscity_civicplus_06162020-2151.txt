WHAT IS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?
Economic development is often described as the creation of jobs and wealth, and the improvement 
of quality of life.
Economic development often includes three major themes:
(1) Policies that government undertakes to meet broad economic objectives including inflation 
control, high unemployment and sustainable growth.
(2) Policies and programs to provide services including building highways, managing parks, and 
providing medical access to the disadvantaged.
(3) Polices and programs explicitly directed at improving the business climate through specific 
efforts, business finance, marketing, neighborhood development, business retention and 
expansion, technology transfer, real estate development and others.
Main goal of economic development is improving the economic well being of a community through 
efforts that entail job creation, job retention, tax base enhancements and quality of life.

GSMP FOCUS:

no matter the size of the operation.
