Brief Description: 
Subdivision and site plan to create a 3.9 acre lot for the existing residence and 3.6 acre lot with existing 
barn for development as a craft brewery with a 12,374 SF second story event space, new driveway and 
parking area, and new pole barn for equipment and inventory storage at 566 Snell Road in the Town of 
Geneva. https://www.co.ontario.ny.us/DocumentCenter/View/24228/75-2020-Aerial 
https://www.co.ontario.ny.us/DocumentCenter/View/24229/75-2020-site-plan 
https://www.co.ontario.ny.us/DocumentCenter/View/24230/75-2020 
The site plan indicates demolition of an existing shed and silo on the property and expansion of the existing driveway as a service 
access for the brewery/event center.   The site plan also indicates a new 24’ access connection from Snell Road to the brewery/event 
center site approximately 125’ south of the existing driveway near the property boundary.  The access connects to a 58 space gravel 
parking area and additional lawn overflow parking.  The referred materials do not include any drainage report or stormwater 
management infrastructure for additional stormwater from the 6,000 SF proposed storage building, expanded service drive or 
parking area.  The narrative indicates existing drainage flows east to Snell Road will be maintained.  The brewery/event center is 
proposed with connected to the Town water and sewer facilities. , The site plan also indicates a monument sign at the new 
entrance. 
 
 
Based on review of the Town of Geneva Zoning Code definitions and Agricultural district allowable uses, the Code does not currently 
allow the proposed brewery/event space in the Agricultural district.  The town Code includes three relevant definitions: 
Agricultural Commerce use an a retail or wholesale enterprise operated as an accessory use to an active farm on the same premises, 
providing products or services principally utilized in agricultural production ... and including breweries, cideries, distilleries, wineries, 
and juice production not otherwise specifically defined as a farm operation. 
Agricultural Tourism agricultural related enterprise accessory to an active farm operation which brings together tourism and 
agricultural for the education and enjoyment of the public and which may include hay rides, corn mazes, petting zoos (farm animals 
only), farm tours, and agricultural themed festivals or other public or private events. 
Food service – an enterprise providing prepared meals drinks, and other food stuff for consumption on or off premises consumption 
and including restaurants, bars, taverns, nightclubs, banquet halls, and catering services, and also including bakeries, craft wineries, 
craft breweries, craft distilleries, and other specialty food or drink producers that provide for on-premises retail sales.

The project site is zoned Agricultural.  Agricultural Commerce is an allowed use in the Agricultural district, Food Service is not an 
allowed use in the Agricultural district; Food Service is allowed in the Town Center Mixed Use and the Town Center Arterial districts. 
The Lake View Overlay district allows event facilities for private gatherings.  The property is not in the Lake View Overlay district. 
The application indicates and staff have confirmed the location was designated rural residential on the future land use map in the 
Comprehensive Plan.  The comprehensive update of the Town zoning code and map retained agricultural zoning for this segment of 
Snell Road.  Rezoning the property to R-2 Rural Residential would not allowed development as proposed. 
Preliminary review by the local CEO indicates a 2nd story event center will not meet code.  
Comments  
1. The Town of Geneva should exercise caution regarding approval of commercial uses in the Agricultural Zoning district, especially 
those not associated with any nearby agricultural operation. If the Town of Geneva would like to allow such a use it is 
recommended that it be added as requiring a special use permit and that relevant conditions include reuse of existing 
agricultural buildings.   
2. The existing driveway will be located on the brewery/event center parcel.  Formal easements should be filed regarding 
continued access to the proposed house lot and in accordance with the driveway agreement providing access to a residence to 
the northwest of the property from this driveway.   
3. What is the maximum guest occupancy for the 12,400 SF event space? Are 58 gravel parking spaces and approximately 16 lawn 
overflow parking spaces sufficient for the number of guests anticipated?

Brief Description: 
Subdivision and PUD to create a 4.41 acre lot for 69,000 SF self -storage with 10% green space in former BJ 
building and a 3.53 acre for a new 14,000 SF mixed use building with two 4,000 SF restaurant s with drive 
thru and a 6,000 SF retail space with 44% greenspace. 
https://www.co.ontario.ny.us/DocumentCenter/View/24231/76-2020-Site-Plan 
This redevelopment of the former BJs building and parking area would result in increasing open space by .59 acres to 24.5 percent 
overall on the 7.9 acre site.  Parking will be adding where the fueling facility was demolished and greenspace will replace parking 
along the south and west perimeter of the site and around the drive thru loop at the north end of the new building.  The application 
indicates any new lighting would be no higher that existing lighting.  
 
The Development Plan for the rezoning indicates 147 parking spaces are required and 199 are proposed.  The plan shows 
approximately 80 parking spaces on Lot 1 and 117 spaces on Lot 2.  Based on review of the Town Code, required parking spaces by 
use are as follows: 
8,000 SF restaurant use at 15 space/1,000 SF  
120 spaces 
Lot 2 
6,000 SF retail use at 1 space/400 SF

The proposed subdivision allocates the majority of the open space to Lot 2, the new development site, and less parking than 
proposed uses would require.  The proposed subdivision also unevenly allocates open space 9.6 % of Lot 1 and 44 % of Lot 2. 
 
The property is also proposed for rezoning from Town Center Arterial to PUD.  PUD regulations require area proposed for rezoning 
be at least 5 acres and that proposed development retain 35 % open space.  As outlined in the definition of open space in 165-3 such 
open space may protect and preserve floodplains, wetlands, slopes of 25% +, natural drainage ways; architectural and cultural 
resources; matures woodlands, geologic features, meadows; upland buffer and/or provide for landscaped common areas and traffic 
islands.  
 
The PUD regulations require applicant to provide area, setback, building density, and height limits; statement of purpose; building 
and architectural characteristics; evaluate external traffic impacts on adjacent properties and impact of project on local taxation; 
and conceptual stormwater management.  The regulations also indicate proposed development shall not impose an unreasonable 
burden upon essential public facilities including drainage structures.  Where such facility is not adequate to service the PUD, the 
applicant is responsible establish its ability, willingness, and binding commitment to satisfy the Town Board and Planning Board of its 
plan to remedy and to file needed easements.  
 
The process for designation as a PUD includes Town Board review in consultation with the Planning Board. The Town Board is 
required to act with days, to notify OCPD of decision, and to send the final Development Plan to the Planning Board.  As part of its 
site plan approval, the Planning Board may allow minor adjustments to the Development Plan such as boundary of open space or 
yard area. Final Development Plan approval lapses in 1 year if not extended although the rezoning stands.  
 
Comments 
1. In reviewing this requested rezoning, development plan, and subdivision the Town Board should consider an appropriate 
location for a through road connection from Berryfields Road through this parcel and/or 103.00-3-49.100 to the south and east 
and continuing through the Town Center Mixed Use district to SR 14A. 
2. The Town Board should balance the likely need for proposed parking and the impact of the extra impervious areas and consider 
whether any areas should be converted to green space and shown on the development plan as land banked parking.  In any 
case, the parking should meet the standards of 1 canopy tree for every 5 parking spaces and related spacing requirements.   
3. Is the eastern most access point intended for trash pickup and delivery vehicles only?  If not, service areas should be 
appropriately screened from customers using the driveway.  In any case the service areas should be appropriately screened 
from the adjacent property.  
4. The Town Board should consider the appropriate orientation of the proposed building facing:  the storage building as proposed, 
facing NYS 5/US 20, or facing Berryfields Road.  
5. The Town Board should consider whether any building mass and articulation standards should be included  to ensure 
appropriate facade elements are included on each building side given building orientation to roads, driveways and other uses.  
6. What is the height of the existing lighting? Is this height suitable for the desired character of the proposed redevelopment?  
7. What are the setbacks associated with the proposed Development Plan?  Are they appropriate? 
8. The application letter indicates the overall percent open space in the area rezoned to PUD would be 24.5 % open space, 
however, the PUD Development Plan indicates both Lot 1 and the overall site would have 9.6 percent open space.  In any case, 
the PUD as proposed would require an Area Variance from the 35% open space requirement.  
9. The Town Board may want to consider amending its PUD regulations to make PUD rezoning revert to previous zoning if 
Development Plan lapses at a longer interval.

Brief Description: 
Subdivision to create 29 single family home lots and 1 lot for five 10-unit multi-family buildings at 212 
Carter Street north of Rosewood Drive in the Town of Geneva. 
https://www.co.ontario.ny.us/DocumentCenter/View/24233/80-2020-Aerial 
https://www.co.ontario.ny.us/DocumentCenter/View/24234/80-2020 
The development site includes two parcels a 32.7 acre rural residential parcel with access off Rosewood Drive and an 18.7 acre 
parcel with access off Rosewood Drive and Carter Street. The larger parcel also borders the  
Boys & Girls Club property and a 1.5 mile ROW owned by and connected to the Cornell Agricultural Station lands east and west of CR 
6. It is developed with a single family home built in 2015 that appears to have access off Carter Street that is shared by the solar 
panel project on the smaller parcel.   
 
The smaller parcel, excluding access points and the northern portion of the larger parcel are zoned R-5 High Density Residential 
which allows single family, two-family, and townhouse uses at a maximum density of 12 units/acre and maximum building, parking, 
and road coverage of 70 percent.  The remaining lands are zoned R-1 Suburban Residential which allows single family, two-family, 
ONTARIO COUNTY PLANNING DEPARTMENT • 20 ONTARIO ST. • CANANDAIGUA, NY  14424 • 585-396-4455 • WWW.CO.ONTARIO.NY.US

and townhouse uses at a maximum density of 4 units/acres and public utility uses.  There are also a variety of community uses 
allowed by special use permit in both districts.  Phase I consists of 50 rental townhouses and 23 of the single family home proposed 
in the area zoned R-5.  These SF lots are mostly 3,600 SF.  Phase II includes 6 single family homes on larger lots then phase I area 
zoned R-1.   
 
The existing home is proposed for use as a community building and the existing .23 acre pond will remain.  The existing driveway is 
proposed for redevelopment as a town road with 3’ paved shoulders along both sides and a concrete sidewalk along the south side, 
and providing access to parking for a community building and one of the MF buildings.  The remaining uses are sited along a 
proposed private loop off this road.  The loop road has paved shoulders and sidewalk along some segments and concrete gutters in 
other areas.   
 
The site plan also shows development of a pool, 2nd community building, 2 greenhouse, 8 stormwater management areas, 2 storage 
unit buildings, presumably for townhouse residents, and areas for the central solar battery bank and vegetable gardens.  Application 
materials also indicate 100 parking spaces and lighting along the central pedestrian path.  No mention is made of parking lot lighting. 
The buildings and parking cover approximately 5.5 acres of the combined 51.4 acres replacing most of 8.1 acres of forest with 
development and 2.9 acres of lawn.   
 
The landscaping plan indicates 1 tree/8 spaces in the townhouse parking areas and one tree on each SF lots.  There are no trees 
indicated along the public road or along portions of the loop road fronting townhouses or the existing pond.  No foundation 
landscaping is shown roads, around MF or community buildings.  The properties are not served by public water or sewer although 
adjacent properties are and district extensions are proposed.  
 
According to OnCor the properties are not in the agricultural districts, though 92 % are prime soils, and not subject to wetland, 
floodplain, or steep slope development constraints. The EAF, though not OnCor indicate the properties are the properties are 
located over a principal aquifer.  
 
Comments 
1. The applicant should be required to show the full allowable development potential of the property and potential road and trail 
linkages to adjacent sites.  
2.  Consider requiring at stub at the end of the proposed public road to serve potential future development.  
3. Given the number of units proposed, a second access point will be necessary.

Replacement of underground fuel storage tanks at Speedway, 239 West Main Street in the Village of Victor.

https://www.co.ontario.ny.us/DocumentCenter/View/24238/85-2020-VAMP-excerpt 
No modification of existing access, building, or parking are anticipated.  The fuel canopy must be demolished to remove 
underground storage tanks and will be replaced with same materials and footprint.  The underground storage tanks and concrete 
pad above the tanks will be relocated to the grass area to the west of the canopy.   
 
According to OnCor there are areas of 16-30 percent slope along the western portion of the developed lot adjacent to the RR ROW. 
 
Comments 
1. What is the height of the replacement canopy?  Is it higher than existing canopy height? 
2. Canopy lighting should be recessed. 
3. What existing grass areas will remain?  How large is the new concrete area above new tanks in the existing grass areas? What 
changes in stormwater will result from changes in area of impervious surface?  
4. The Victor Access Management Plan identifies desirability of onsite pedestrian connection from SR 96 to the RR 
ROW/conceptual future road.  The site plan should include such a connection, perhaps along the western most property line. 
5. What is the size of the existing tanks? 
6. Will there be sufficient separation between entering vehicles and vehicles using the air machine?  Will a portion of the existing 
line of wheel stops be retained? 
7. The Victor Access Management Plan identifies a future vehicle access connection from the RR ROW/Conceptual future road to 
be shared with the property to the east.  The applicant may want to ensure the site can accommodate this future access point.

Subdivision into 2 lots of a 10 acre lot at 4811 Herendeen Road east for CR 28 in the Town of Farmington.  
The parent parcel has 411’ of road frontage and a driveway providing access to a home.  Lot 1 will be 1.87 acres with 193’ of 
frontage and the existing house. Lot 2 will be 8.1 acres, mostly wetlands some wooded, and have 219’ of road frontage.   
 
The A-80 district allows lots with conventional septic systems to be developed with 150 of road frontage.  It is unclear whether 
either the existing home or proposed lot meets this standard.  Lots not suitable for a conventional septic system require 300’ of 
frontage

Brief Description: 
Area variance for 13.2 SF medical office sign at SR 96 and Omnitech Place.  Variances are required to allow 
off-premises sign on land owned by Thurway Authority, to allow sign within the SR 96 ROW, and to allow 
sign within 35 ' of the pavement of Omnitech Place. 
The proposed 6’ high, 5’wide monument sign is for a 22,000 SF orthopedic office building at 7670 Omnitech Place.  The proposed 
sign and location received NYSTA and NYSDOT permits. The area variance for the setback from Omnitech Place is dues to lot 
configuration and topography.  If the sign were setback 35’ setback from the ROW, the sign would be below the grade of the 
roadway.  Such a location does not provide desired separation from sign on adjacent Wilkens RV property nor good visibility.  Any 
sign maintenance would require a NYSDOT work permit

primary travel corridors by encouraging local boards to adhere to their adopted laws as much as possible. 
Final Classification: Class 1 
Findings 
1. Signs that comply with local dimensional requirements will have the minimal practical level of impact on community character. 
Final Recommendation: The CPB will make no formal recommendation to deny or approve applications for signs that comply with 
local limits on size and or number

Propane 
The proposed propane facility will be in a 100’x122’ fenced area behind the applicant’s existing overhead door business and will 
include the 60,000 storage tank as well as a 12’x24’ office and a 32’x60’ truck garage.  There is a proposed infiltration basis to the 
north east of the proposed development. There is a combination swing and slide gate for gas delivery vehicle and 2 additional 4’ 
egress gates. 
Referred materials include a fire safety assessment with record of compliance with separation, water availability and firefighting 
capabilities of Seneca Castle Fire District provided by Fire Chief.  Public water is available along this stretch of SR 5/US 20 with 
hydrants at the overhead door company, 84 Lumber to the east of the site, and the car dealership across the street.  
Comments 
1. The site plan does not indicate the route LP Gas transport vehicles will take to the facility or the surface of this driveway. 
2. The site plan does not include details on lighting described in Fire Safety Assessment.  Any lighting should include full cut off 
fixtures to minimize light pollution. 
3. The Site Plan indicates a 15’ required setback on the adjoining property to the north.  Does existing zoning require a 15’ side and 
rear setback for principle and accessory uses?  
4. Is vehicle impact protection need around the tank?
