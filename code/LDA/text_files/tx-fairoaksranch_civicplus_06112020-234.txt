INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: 
In November 2015 a Preliminary Plat, establishing the Preserve at Fair Oaks, was submitted to 
the Public Works Department by KFW Engineers & Surveying (KFW). This tract of land is 
contained in the approximately 145 acres generally referred to as the “Owen’s Tract”. In 
February 2016, a development agreement was signed by the City of Fair Oaks Ranch, David and 
Dianne Owens, and Scott Felder Homes for the approximately 145-acre tract. This subdivision 
was renamed as Arbors at Fair Oaks Ranch and more information on the proposed units can be 
found in the Summary Table below. The development agreement contained a maximum of 91 
residential lots and referred to the Concept Plan, shown below, for the location of lots and rights 
of way.  The development agreement did not specify minimum lot sizes, but the Concept Plan 
showed lots that were generally 80’ wide and 140’ deep.  The proposed lots conform to the size 
in the Concept Plan and range from 0.26 acres to 1.68 acres, with almost half of the lots being 
less than 0.3 acres. 
The development agreement included stipulations regarding a 19-acre green buffer area for 
the residential lots, a 75-acre natural Preserve Area to be maintained by the Fair Oaks Ranch 
Homeowners Association (FORHA) with city access, 4,100 liner feet of 10-foot wide nature 
trails, roadway access to the nature trail with parking and related improvement.  Most of these 
improvements have been undertaken.

In January 2018, the City received a preliminary plat establishing the Arbors Unit 2 at Fair Oaks 
Ranch and the preliminary plat was approved at that time. As per the subdivision ordinance, the 
preliminary plat approval is valid for one year and the preliminary plat approval has expired. 
Therefore, the applicant is resubmitting the preliminary plat for consideration and  approval.  
Staff had reviewed the plat and relayed review comments to the applicant.   The applicant needed 
more time to address staff comments and had requested an extension of the 30-day period to act 
on this preliminary plat.  Staff is working with the applicant to address outstanding comments  
and will provide an update at the meeting.

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: 
The City of Fair Oaks Ranch annexed approximately this property located in Comal County in May 
of 2007.  The development is located on the west side of the City and abuts the western City limit 
line. The Master Plan (Exhibit 4) for the residential development included 212 lots, with a density 
of 1.24 acre per lot, and approximately 20 acres of open space.   
The purpose of this application is to plat approximately 21 acres for open space purposes. The applicant 
is not proposing any improvements or tree removal currently. The plat includes two lots, a 19.16-
acre open space and a 2.07 acre well site.  Most of the area included in the plat boundary is zoned 
as Parks and Open Space.  However, there is portion fronting Setterfeld Circle that is zoned 
Existing Residential Two. (Exhibit 2 – Zoning map)  It is not clear if the applicant is proposing to 
retain the residentially zoned land as a residential lot.  Most of the subject area is shown as 
Existing Parks and Open Space in the Future Land Use Map (FLUM), (Exhibit 3 – Future Land Use 
Map)    
The submittal of the Setterfeld Unit 3A is being considered as a preliminary plat submission as it 
appears that there may be some public improvements required.  Staff has requested clarification 
from the applicant.  
Staff had reviewed the plat and relayed review comments to the applicant.   The applicant needed 
more time to address staff comments and had requested an extension of the 30-day period to act 
on this preliminary plat.  Staff is working with the applicant to address outstanding comments 
and will provide an update at the meeting.
