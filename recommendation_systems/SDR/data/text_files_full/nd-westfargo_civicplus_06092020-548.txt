DISCUSSION AND OBSERVATIONS: 
• 
The applicant has submitted an application for a proposed replat and rezoning.  
• 
When Sandhills 3rd was platted and zoned, Lot 21 was not included as the previous property owner 
was located in Canada.  The parcel remained Agricultural.  City Vision has since purchased the lot. 
• 
The rezoning is necessary for further construction of light industrial facilities.  
• 
The two new lots will meet the current zoning district requirements, with a 40-foot shared access 
easement onto 4th Avenue NW.  
• 
Right-of-way is adequate as needs for commercial/industrial roadways are required to be a 
minimum of 80 feet.

CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT 
3605 2nd Street East , West Fargo, North Dakota 
Unplatted parcel in the  SW¼ of Section 29, T139N, R49W), City of West Fargo, North Dakota 
Owner/Applicant: Jeff Eberhardt 
Staff Contact:   Tim Solberg, AICP 
Planning & Zoning Commission Introduction: 
06-09-2020 
Public Hearing: 
06-09-2020 
City Commission: 
 
 
PURPOSE: 
Construction of accessory building for a non-farm residential use in an Agricultural district 
 
STATEMENTS OF FACT: 
Land Use Classification: 
G-2: Sub-Urban - Growth Sector 
Existing Land Use: 
Residential 
Current Zoning District(s): 
A: Agricultural 
Zoning Overlay District(s): 
NA 
Total area size: 
1.65 Acres 
Adjacent Zoning Districts: 
West, North & South - A: Agricultural); East - R-1A: Single 
Family Dwellings 
Adjacent street(s): 
2nd Street East (Local) 
Adjacent Bike/Pedestrian Facilities: 
None 
Available Parks/Trail Facilities: 
None 
 
DISCUSSION AND OBSERVATIONS: 
• 
The property is located within the City Limits between 32nd and 40th Avenues East in an area 
bordered by parcels to the north and south, which have yet to be annexed into the City. 
• 
The current use of a non-farm single-family dwelling is considered a conditional use within the 
Agricultural District and was in place at the time of adoption into the City Limits’ Boundary.  Any 
addition to an existing conditional use requires an amended conditional use permit.   Although the 
property has been annexed, it has never been platted.  It has been anticipated that when 
development of the surrounding properties that have yet to be annexed occurs that it would then 
be likely that this property would be platted and properly zoned to a residential zoning district. 
• 
The applicant submitted site and elevation plans showing a new 30’ x 28’ (840 ft2) footprint, two-
story structure with a gross floor area of 1,572 ft².  There would be no size restrictions within the 
A: Agricultural district, it is at the discretion of the conditional use permit process. 
• 
The proposed structure is proposed to meet the required setback distances of a standard City of 
West Fargo local road with moderately increased right of way width of 70’.  The site plan provided 
however incorrectly indicates that right of way is provided – the lot has not yet been platted.  This 
section of 2nd St E however has been determined that it will remain a local road and we anticipate 
no more than 70’ of right of way will be required at time of platting. 
• 
The proposed elevations indicate the building would be built of residential materials.  The building 
height is proposed to be around 20.5’ at midpoint.  This is not an issue for the Agricultural district, 
CITY OF WEST FARGO PLANNING & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
STAFF REPORT 
 
2 | P a g e  
 
however if the property were to be rezoned to a residential district this would exceed the allowable 
height of a detached accessory structure which is 15’ at midpoint. 
• 
A conditional use permit agreement is required to be signed prior to issuance of a building permit 
and may include conditions deemed appropriate by the Commission. 
 
CRITERIA FOR GRANTING CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT: 
With reference to the criteria for granting conditional uses, the following is noted: 
1. Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to 
automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case 
of fire or catastrophe.  
 
The property has adequate access and the improvements will not affect this access. 
2. Off-street parking and loading areas where required, with particular attention to the items in 
(1) above and the economic, noise, glare or odor effects of the special exception on adjoining 
properties and properties generally in the district.  
 
No concerns noted 
3. Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items in (1) and (2) above. 
 
No concerns noted 
4. Utilities, with reference of locations, availability, and compatibility. 
 
No concerns noted 
5. Screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions, and character. 
 
No concerns noted 
6. Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic 
effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district. 
 
No concerns noted 
7. Required yards and other open space. 
 
No concerns noted. 
8. Soil conditions, as they relate to on-site sewage disposal, water supply, basement excavating, 
road construction and related land use. 
 
No concerns noted. 
9. General compatibility with adjacent properties and other property in the district. 
 
The land adjacent to this area is tilled farmland with single family residential to the east.  
Incompatible development patterns are not anticipated. 
 
NOTICES: 
Sent to: 
Property owners within 350’ and applicable agencies and departments.   
Comments Received:  
• 
None 
 
CONSISTENCY WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND OTHER APPLICABLE CITY PLANS AND 
ORDINANCES: 
• 
There are no plans for incompatible development patterns in the vicinity. 
• 
Regarding structure height, it is not consistent with current residential district standards.  Staff 
would note however that West Fargo 2.0 as well as a current trend in providing for increase 
CITY OF WEST FARGO PLANNING & COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
STAFF REPORT 
 
3 | P a g e  
 
affordable housing options and housing choice would push to not limit the potential for accessory 
dwelling units which would likely result in the City increasing the height limitations for detached 
accessory structures depending upon their side and rear setback distances.  The proposed 
structure has an approximate 50’ side yard setback so there may be little to be concerned with 
height – the biggest concern would be if the property were rezoned without changes to current 
ordinances which would result in a legal non-conforming structure. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
It is recommended that the City either approve the proposed application on the basis that it is 
consistent with City plans and ordinances with recommended conditions of approval as follows: 
 
1. Consideration be given to how the home and accessory building may transition if it were to be 
rezoned to a residential district. 
2. A Signed Conditional Use Permit Agreement is received.

PURPOSE: 
• 
Constructing an off premise sign within the DMU: Downtown Mixed Use District for the purpose 
allowing for off-premise advertising on the existing electronic message center and to provide for 
an off-premise sign which denotes sponsorship of the POW/MIA Plaza

DISCUSSION AND OBSERVATIONS: 
• 
The applicant has submitted an application, as well as site and building plans and elevations of the 
existing and proposed sign.  The proposed sign is 6’ x 3’ (18 ft2) and the existing sign is a 9.46’ x 
15.75’ (149 ft²) video board to promote sponsors, events taking place in the district and for 
commercial tenants of the properties located within the POW/MIA Plaza area.  
• 
DMU: Downtown Mixed Use District zoning district allows for off-premise signage as a conditional 
use with the statement that “Signage within the district should take into account the characteristics 
of its surrounding area and the intent and context of a vibrant entertainment environment.  The 
Commission should deliberate such items as size, intensity of light or color, and motion to avoid 
nuisance factors to the public and neighboring uses.” 
• 
City Sign Regulation 4-460.9.2.d which regulates “Off-Premise signs” states that no two off-premise 
signs may be placed less than two hundred fifty (250) feet apart, unless said signs are separated by 
buildings or other obstructions in such a manner that only one sign is visible from the roadway at 
any time.  The signs are both facing inward toward the POW/MIA Plaza and not the street.  The 
larger video board is visible from the street and is closer to the roadway.  It could be construed that 
the smaller 18-ft² sign is not visible from the street and is intended primarily to denote the

STAFF REPORT

sponsorship of the plaza creating a unique situation that given the opportunity to review as a 
conditional use provides for discretion and consideration of the Planning Commission and City 
Commission. 
• 
The property is developed with a multi-tenant mixed-use building with varying general commercial 
and residential uses as well as a community plaza. 
• 
A conditional use permit agreement is required to be signed prior to issuance of a building permit 
and may include conditions deemed appropriate by the Commission. 
 
CRITERIA FOR GRANTING CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT: 
With reference to the criteria for granting conditional uses, the following is noted: 
5. Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to 
automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case 
of fire or catastrophe.  
 
No concerns noted.   
6. Off-street parking and loading areas where required, with particular attention to the items in 
(1) above and the economic, noise, glare or odor effects of the special exception on adjoining 
properties and properties generally in the district.  
 
No concerns noted. 
7. Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items in (1) and (2) above. 
 
No concerns noted. 
8. Utilities, with reference of locations, availability, and compatibility. 
 
No concerns noted. 
9. Screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions, and character. 
 
No concerns noted. 
10. Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic 
effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district. 
 
Discretion and discernment should be given by the Commission taking into account scale 
of the sign against the adjacent properties as well as concerns from neighboring properties 
notified as well as the general public. 
11. Required yards and other open space. 
 
No concerns noted.  
12. Soil conditions, as they relate to on-site sewage disposal, water supply, basement excavating, 
road construction and related land use. 
 
No concerns noted. 
13. General compatibility with adjacent properties and other property in the district. 
 
The land adjacent to this area is Downtown Mixed Use Zoning District and compatible uses 
and buildings have been previously approved within the subdivision.

NOTICES: 
Sent to: 
Property owners within 350’. 
Comments Received: 
• 
An email was received from a property owner indicating concerns with building lighting at the 
Pioneer Place and Sheyenne Plaza buildings, as well as the existing video monitor being on all 
night. 
• 
An email was received asking that the same considerations are in place, similar to that of the 
off-premise sign approved at The Lights, such as a timer and dimmer being used.  He also 
expressed concerns with building lighting. 
• 
A call was received from an individual with rental property to the west asking for more 
information.  He indicated he had no concerns with placement of signs once informed they 
were located on the north side of the building. 
 
CONSISTENCY WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND OTHER APPLICABLE CITY PLANS AND ORDINANCES: 
• 
Off-premise signs are not specifically addressed in the Comprehensive Plan, but should be 
considered in context to the approved district.  The sign appears to be appropriately sized; 
however, staff is cautious to ensure that the surrounding properties and general public will not be 
negatively affected by the proposal.  These are considerations that should be carefully deliberated 
by both Planning Commission and City Commission. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
If it is found through deliberation by the Commission that the proposal will not generate a nuisance to 
adjacent properties and the general public, it is recommended that the City approve the proposed 
application on the basis that it is consistent with City plans and ordinances with recommended 
conditions of approval as follows: 
 
1. Consideration be given to citizen concerns over the lighting intensity and/or timing of the video 
board. 
2. The signs are accessory to the building and POW/MIA plaza within the Downtown Mixed Use 
District and should either the building or the zoning district change, then the sign would require 
review and potential removal. 
3. The proposed signs do not exceed the current proposal of 18 ft² for the POW/MIA Sponsorship sign 
and 149 ft² for the existing video board thus providing sufficient response to the requirements for 
off-premise signage found in Section 4-460.9.2.d of City Ordinances. 
4. A Signed Conditional Use Permit Agreement is received. 
 
PLANNING AND ZONING RECOMMENDATION: 
At their May 12, 2020 meeting, the Planning and Zoning Commission tabled this item to allow for more 
information from the applicant outlining the use of the video board for off-premise advertising.  
Commissioners were concerned with changing the purpose of the video board and the sign not meeting 
criteria and setting a precedence.

UPDATE: 
The applicant submitted a letter outlining the use of the video board for off-premise advertising, 
provided the following: 
 
• 
“The City of West Fargo has contracted with West Fargo Events to provide management, 
programming, and maintenance services on the City of West Fargo’s POW/MIA Plaza. The intention 
for the Conditional Use Permit application submitted by West Fargo Events is to permit the video 
board as an off-premise sign consistent with the Downtown Mixed-Use Zoning District. The screen 
hours of operation can be adjusted as needed for city ordinance. Our current arrangement is 6am-
11pm to minimize the impact it has on the neighborhood.” 
 
At the time of packet preparation, the applicant was reworking details on the placement of the 
Choice Bank Sponsorship sign – staff will provide a rendering to Planning Commission via email as 
soon as it is received. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
If it is found through deliberation by the Commission that the proposal will not generate a nuisance to 
adjacent properties and the general public, it is recommended that the City approve the proposed 
application on the basis that it is consistent with City plans and ordinances with recommended 
conditions of approval as listed above.

Proposed Conditional Use Permit
We feel there are already too many lights in the area at night.  The Pioneer building has lights on the back of the 
building and at the south end top in their open area, all of them too bright.  There is the tower lights at the 
POW/MIA park that are on all night plus the park/VFW sign and the advertising monitor.  It is just too much.

Off-Premise Signage Public Hearing

Hello,
I would ask that the same considerations are in place, like recommendation #1 states, that a
timer and dimmer are used, similar to that of the off-premise sign approved at The Lights.
The Dost's are correct in that the lighting is on all night (both the towers and string lights).
There's not a need for that lighting to be on all night. I know a neighbor has had to purchase
black-out curtains so they can live comfortably in their house because of it (they purchased the
house before the plaza was constructed).
My wife's grandma received the notification and the only concerns that I've heard are about
the lighting all night.
Thank you,
Roben Anderson
