V) Report from Board Committee’s   
A. Finance Committee  
Mr. Austin gave the finance committee report. The committee met on April 8th. The members presenter were Kevin 
Austin, Darrell Frye, Mark Richardson, Lenny Williams, Steve Carter and Rick Morris. Budgets for the upcoming 
year were reviewed. It is projected the revenues will be down 29% over fiscal year 2020 primarily due to a reduction 
in rental vehicle tax and fares revenues. Expenses will also be down primarily due to the completion of the Business 
40 Mitigation project and staff vacancies. The grant funds has been developed based on the purchase of 10 buses and 
14 van purchases will be partially funded through Grant revenues. Matching funds will come from a capital reserve 
fund, 47% of those matching funds will come from in capital reserve and the other 53% from the general fund. The 
commuter resources fund revenues are projected to be down 26% primarily due to the current decline in vanpool 
rentals. The expenditures are projected to be down 19% based on a reduction in fuel prices and the conclusion of the 
telematics study. The capital reserve transfer to the grants fund is budgeted at $592,000 for approved Capital 
purchases. The fiscal year 2021 increased capital reserve fund will be calculated based on the fiscal 2020 audited 
financial statements and financial requirements. No committee members offered comments.

operation at this time. It was determined that PART would not charge vanpool riders at this time.  
 
Hazardous duty pay, time-and-a-half, will be paid to the operators. Extreme care is being taken to protect passengers, 
operators and CTC personnel. Buses are being cleaned several times during the day. Passengers are being asked to

Mr. Terrell interjected that any rules related to passengers need to be adopted by the board. It was decided that the 
committee minutes and the PART’s What Happening contained the rules in detail. Mr. Terrell read the rules as 
followed:

Mr. Fox announced that he needed to leave the meeting at this time. 
 
Mr. Besse returned to Ms. Hightower’s request for information. Mr. Rhine indicated that there have not had any 
issues with regards to these new rules. Personnel and passengers are wearing facial mask. In some cases, passengers 
are wearing bandanas. Mr. Rhine indicated the staff was beginning to prepare for increase service levels back to 
normal levels. Decisions will need to be balanced against need and resource distribution. As economic conditions 
return to normal and employers such as UNC Hospital and the university return to work staff will devise plans that 
will be presented to the Planning and Operations Committee. 
 
VI) Consideration of Board Business Items   
A. New Business  
 
1) FY2020-21 Budgets / Release for Public Comment  
Mr. Rhine introduced the item and mentioned that under the circumstances budget amendments will occur in the 
future. Ms. Conklin added that under the current conditions she saw three options to prepare a budget, 1) adopt an 
interim, 2) limit expenditures based on uncertain revenues, or budget revenues and expenditures with what is known 
and adjust as needed using the capital reserves. She indicated staff elected to go with the third option and move 
forward with the FY2020-21 budgets as presented; with expected budget ordinance amendments when actuals are 
recognized from the unknown outcomes of COVID-19. Ms. Conklin proceeded to review the budget assumptions 
outlined in the agenda package. She asked if there were any questions, and none were asked. 
 
a) General Fund Budget     
The total proposed budget is $8.7M which represents a 10% decrease from the previous year. The revenue projection 
represents a 29% decrease from the previous year due to a 16% decrease in rental vehicle tax, a decrease in fare box 
collections, no grant revenues related to the Business 40 Mitigation Project and the lack proceeds from property 
disposal. The budget includes a $1.2M operating deficit but it is fully anticipated the CARES Act funding and other 
revenues will increase. Again, she asked for questions.  
 
Expenditures are expected to decrease 9% before transfers. The decrease is again due to the completion of the 
Business 40 Mitigation Project. Increases in expenditures in other area are a result of a full staff being in place, 
operational increases are related to changes in service delivery for PART Express, maintenance and repairs to 
facilities, and IT improvements. Finally, there is a transfer to the grants fund related to the procurement of buses and 
vans. 
 
A $1.2M operating deficit does exist prior to the transfer from the fund balance. It is fully anticipated that the 
CARES Act funding will ultimately reduce the effective amount of the transfer. Again Ms. Conklin asked for 
questions. 
 
Chair Besse asked if the fund balance will decrease even if the CARES Act funding is received. Ms. Conklin 
clarified that it was believed that the appropriation from the fund balance to the general budget will be less than 
budgeted and that the fund balance will be maintained. 
 
b) Grants Fund Budget     
Ms. Conklin proceeded to review the Grants funds which will be $5.5M for FY 21. This includes the purchase of 10 
buses and 14 vans. Expenses will show in the capital and general funds with revenues coming from federal and 
NCDOT sources, and local funds consisting of general revenue and capital reserve fund. Again Ms. Conklin asked 
for questions. None were asked. 
 
c) Commuter Resources Fund Budget  
Ms. Conklin proceeded review the Commuter Resources fund and stated that the entire budget for the program is 
$1.042M. Operating revenues are decreased by 23% due to the anticipated decrease in van pools due to COVID-19. 
Additionally, grant funding revenues and related expenses are not included due to the completion of the Telematics 
 
10 
 
Study. On the expenses there is a 25% decreases due to insurance, fuel and completion of the Telematics Study, full 
staff and IT support.  
 
The Capital Reserve Fund was not included in the package but again shows a transfer to the grants funds previously 
detailed. In summary these budgets are very fluid and depending on conditions will be subject to great changes than 
normal. Ms. Conklin called for any final questions. 
 
Mr. Horn asked what are the plans for COLA adjustments. Ms. Conklin said that 1% was budgeted. Mr. Horne asked 
what the 1% was based on, was a known government projection. Ms. Conklin responded that it was based on 
historical trends. Mr. Horn then asked for the budget reflected an increase in benefits. Ms. Conklin responded that it 
does reflect a 15.5% increase in medical benefit cost. 
 
Mr. Carter stated the Guilford County is targeted to received $93M from the federal government with fewer 
restrictions than other COIVD-19 relief funding. He asked if PART is expecting to ask or receive funds from the 
individual counties. Mr. Rhine responded not at this time. 
 
Mr. Rhine further indicated that caution will be taken with capital purchases and improvements. Due diligence and 
prudence will be used and respond to how society recovers and the impacts of our revenues and expenses will be 
closely monitored. He further mentioned that a Bus RFP will be an upcoming action for award, and that vehicle 
procurement and necessary adjustments may be made to capital purchases. 
 
Chair Besse thanked Ms. Conklin and Mr. Rhine for the presentation. He asked for any further questions. Hearing 
none he asked for a motion to submit the budget as presented for a 30-day comment period.  
 
Ms. Hightower was recognized and asked if Mr. Rhine would consider asked Guilford County for funding. A 
discussion ensued related to request funds from Guilford County as well as other counties.  
 
Mr. Mengert and Mr. Carter announced they needed to leave the meeting. 
 
Ms. Coleman asked if other counties would be asked. Mr. Frye commented that not all counties received additional 
funding. Mr. Williams asked that if one County was asked all counties should be asked. Mr. Besse acknowledged the 
discussion and asked Mr. Rhine to acknowledge the input which he did. 
 
2) Consideration of Interlocal Agreement with the City of Greensboro 
Chair Besse asked Mr. Rhine to introduce the next item. Mr. Rhine explained that the resolution under consideration 
related to the Regional Travel Demand Model (RTDM). The RTDM is the primary tool used by the four Piedmont 
Triad MPO’s and NCDOT to evaluate future traffic congestion. PART is the custodian of the model. He said the 
model depends on numerous data inputs - including travel behaviors of Piedmont Triad drivers. The travel behavior 
data presently used is out of date. Special Project and Research (SPR) Funds have been secured by PART, with the 
assistance of NCDOT, to conduct a Household Travel Survey (HHTS). This funding will be managed by the 
Greensboro MPO which will reduce the amount of the local match required. The 10% local match will be shared by 
the four MPO’s. There is no direct financial commitment on behalf PART. PART will take the lead in the project 
management in partnership with the Greensboro MPO. The resolution will acknowledge the arrangement between 
NDCOT, the Greensboro MPO and PART. Mr. Besse asked if there were any questions.  
 
Ms. Hightower asked about the selection of the third-party vendor. Mr. Rhine indicated that a vendor has not been 
selected. An RFP and scope of work has been prepared and a solicitation process will begin in the next few months. 
Ms. Hightower then asked for clarification on the financial commitment by each agency. She expressed concern that 
Greensboro was the brunt of the financial burden. Mr. Rhine clarified the 80% of funds were federal highway dollars 
through the SPR funding, 10% NCDOT and 10% local which will be shared by all four MPO’s. He further clarified 
that the Greensboro MPO is only involved to reduce the local match from 20% to 10%. Local funds that each MPO 
will use, including the City of Greensboro, are from previously budget funds through each MPO’s UPWP.

procurement at the November 13, 2019 board meeting.  Between November 2019 and February 2020 an RFP was 
developed. Beginning February 2, 2020 an RFP for Heavy duty bus was released to the industry to solicit 
responsive and responsible submissions from qualified heavy-duty bus manufacturers. 
 
The RFP and all related documentation were maintained on the PART website throughout the solicitation process.  
All communication was provided to the participating local transit systems and the manufacturer’s in the industry.  
There is a total of 8 public transit agencies that are included in the PART RFP for heavy duty bus.  Those systems

vehicle vans, LTV and Heavy-Duty Buses. 
 
In addition, the PART Capital Reserve fund budget includes local dollars designated for fleet vehicle purchasing.  
The current budget for FY2020-21 has the purchase of 10 heavy duty buses in FY2020-21.  With the underlining 
uncertainty of impacts to local revenues; staff proposes to adjust our plans for purchasing replacement fleet 
vehicles for the upcoming year. 
 
The item presented is to authorize the PART Executive Director to purchase 6 heavy-duty buses that are 
designated with local funds coming from the Capital Reserve Budget.  The additional vehicles planned for 
purchase will be delayed until such time that the impacts of COVID-19 are fully reflected on our local revenues 
and General Fund transfers.  The additional vehicles planned to be purchased in the FY2020-21 fiscal year will be 
revisited and brought back for PART Board consideration when time has shown the impacts to our local funds as a 
result of COVID-19. 
 
A resolution is included on page 29 for PART Board consideration.

FY 2021 
 Budget Assumptions 
 
1. Director input as well as FY 2020 annualized actuals were used to develop FY 2021 budgets. 
2. The Budget was developed at the object level for all funds. The Budget Resolution for Expenditures will 
be submitted for approval at the Department Level. 
3. Salaries were forecasted by person and included an increase of 3.5%. It was determined that the total

The benefit rate is 31.07% and has been updated to cover all benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, 
Retirement, Health/Dental/Vision, Workers Compensation, State Unemployment, etc.    
4. The PART express vehicle operations contract was developed through a bottoms-up approach of using 
hours per day per route by month multiplied by the contracted rate for FY 2021.   
5. Fuel for PART Express was budgeted at 2.50/gal which is net of excise taxes. 12% decrease over 
FY2020.

new expenditures for FY 2021. 
7. Expense and revenue accounts were evaluated independently and developed based on known criteria as 
well as inflation of 3% in appropriate cases. 
8. Revenues were budgeted conservatively. Rental Vehicle Tax is based on FY2020 actuals and reduced 
based on the current pandemic. Vehicle Registration Tax is budgeted based on FY 2020 annualization. 
9. The Grants Budget has been developed based on the purchase of 10 Buses and 14 Vans. Purchases will 
be partially funded through grant revenues from Greensboro 5339, NCDOT and FTA.  Matching funds 
will come from the Capital Reserve Fund (47%) and General Fund (53%).  
10. The CR vanpool rentals revenue is based on the FY 2020 latest view with consideration given to 
reductions due to the current pandemic.  
11. The CR grant revenues are reflective of the NCDOT grant application and approved in prior years.  The 
matches by the various cities are in line with previous years.  At this time NCDOT, Hi-Tran, Davidson 
County & PART are funding the Call Center.  Other non-operating revenue is reflective of anticipated 
van sales. 
12. Salaries & Benefits are developed for CR in the same manner as explained in Notes 3 & 4.  
13. Van Pool Fuel was calculated based on reduced gas prices and a decrease in leases. 
14. CR Expenses such as Professional Services, Information Services will decrease due to the conclusion of 
the Telematics, Telematics Study.  Marketing will also decrease due the completion of the Air Quality 
Campaign and the associated Grant Funding. 
15. The General Fund is projected to have operational revenues below expenditures. This deficit is due to 
projected declines in Rental Vehicle Tax Revenues due to the current pandemic.  It is probable that this 
deficit will be offset by additional revenues provide through the CARES Act.  
16. The Capital Reserve Fund transfer is for approved capital purchases. The FY 2021 Increase in the 
Capital Reserve Fund will be calculated based on the FY2021 audited financial statements and financial 
requirements.
