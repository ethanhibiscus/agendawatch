Monday, June 15, 2020 
7:30 PM – Virtual Meeting 
AGENDA 
This agenda is subject to revision at the meeting at the discretion of the Chair. All meetings of the Zoning Board are open to the public, and public 
comments are welcome on specific site presentations after each such presentation, with the length of the comments at the discretion of the Zoning 
Board chairperson. 
 
For the duration of the Coronavirus Health Emergency, City Hall is closed to the public and meetings are held with participants at 
remote locations, connected by conferencing software provided by zoom.us.  Members of the public are invited to view meetings live 
using the Zoom client, which also allows them to "raise a hand" and contribute with voice and video when they are invited to do so 
during public portions of the meeting. 
 
TO JOIN A LIVE MEETING: Members of the public and other participants use the same procedure: 
 
1. If you are joining from a smartphone or tablet, install the Zoom app using the App Store and join meeting number 862 6613 2337 
 
2. If you are joining from a desktop or laptop computer with a web browser, open https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86266132337 
 
In the alternative, if you cannot join the live meeting remotely for any reason you may contact Chris Nicola the Planning and Zoning 
Boards Administrative Officer at 908-273-6407 or via email at cnicola@cityofsummit.org. 
 
When you join a meeting, your microphone will be off (muted) and your camera (if you have one) will not send video to other 
participants. If you are a speaking participant a moderator will enable your mic and permit you to enable your video.
