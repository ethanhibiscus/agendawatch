Review Form for  
PHAB Annual Report Section II 
Form Released: January 2019 
 
 
Each year accredited health departments must submit an annual report to PHAB attesting to their 
continued conformity and describing their performance management and quality improvement efforts. The 
review of Section II of the annual reports is overseen by the Evaluation and Quality Improvement (EQI). 
This review is aimed at supporting the maintenance and advancement of a performance management 
and quality improvement culture in the accredited health department.  
 
The form below includes the reviewer’s comments and recommendations for best practices, based on the 
information provided in the health department’s annual report.  
 
Health Department Name 
City of Nashua Division of Public Health and Community Services (DPHCS) 
Month Review Form Submitted 
June 2020 
Overall Impressions 
 
Thank you for completing and submitting your Annual Report. Congratulations on your efforts to build on your 
successes and on your continued commitment to improvement. 
 
The City of Nashua Division of Public Health and Community Services (DPHCS) incorporated much of the 
feedback from last year's report, providing a great amount of detail so that PHAB can understand the work 
that has occurred over the past year.  DPHCS focused on updating the QI plan, enhancing QI training and 
conducting the NACCHO Self-Assessment Tool (SAT).  This assessment helped inform the QI plan revision 
which outlines four objectives to move the department from phase 3 to phase 4. Excellent work!  
 
DPHCS demonstrated significant leadership support for PM/QI since the last report.  Senior level staff 
completed a leadership development series along with 360 evaluations.  DPHCS also created an Executive 
Leadership Team and a Strategic leadership team to guide the development and leadership of the PM/QI 
culture.  
 
Finally, DPHCS provided a population health measure to monitor substance misuse prevention.  This aligns 
well with the QI research project to better understand the total population using vs. those in treatment.   
 
PHAB staff and the Evaluation and Quality Improvement Committee have reviewed your Annual Report. The 
Evaluation and Quality Improvement Committee has the following feedback specific to your performance 
management and quality improvement efforts. 
 
Performance Management, Quality Improvement Plan, and Culture 
 
DPHCS updated both the PM/QI plan in 2019. This past year, DPHCS consistently reviewed feedback from 
customers and employees. The NACCHO SAT along with PHAB feedback on the 2018 annual report 
informed the revision of both the PM/QI plans. DPHCS purchased VSMG manage, track and prioritize PM/QI 
projects.  Many staff were trained on this new tool, but not all. The department has seen some resistance and 
will be working in 2020 to identify the barriers and implement solutions. The PM/QI committee developed a 
prioritization process for projects along with evaluation tools that will be implemented in 2020. The PM/QI 
plan also developed a training plan that will be implemented in 2020. The department had planned to 
 
 
Page 2 
standardize customer feedback and implement across all programs in 2019; however, this new tool and 
process has only been implemented with a few programs.  In 2020, the process will be widely implemented, 
and data will be entered and regularly reviewed. DPHCS also purchased LiveStories, an interactive data 
dashboard that will publish both health department and community health data indicators. DPHCS also 
surveyed partners as part of the Kresge Award and learned that partners believe the department overburdens 
themselves at times. DPHCS will incorporate all of the feedback they've gathered over the year to inform their 
operations moving forward. Finally, DPHCS has four objectives to improve their QI culture from phase 3-
phase 4 which include: annual training for all staff, employee mentoring and advanced QI training, identify 
and prioritize annual QI projects and acknowledge and celebrate successes. The health department has 
made exemplary strides to achieving a more strengthened culture of improvement – congratulations.  
 
Quality Improvement Project 
 
 
DPHCS shared a QI project determined by a department facilitated discussion among employees 
and community-based organizations about substance use and recovery services.  The conversations 
acknowledged a gap in data about community members who are substance users and their access to 
substance use and recovery services.  
 
The project described may be more aligned with research and/or quality planning project.  The 
project is certainly worthy of community exploration and the objectives and process that DPHCS 
followed and pursued are in alignment with domain 10. The purpose of quality planning is to provide 
an organization with the means to provide services that can meet client and stakeholder services; in 
other words, to develop new programs/services or to revamp them. Quality planning uses many of 
the same tools used in quality improvement. Quality planning is important to do in public health to 
ensure processes and procedures are in place to effectively address public health issues. Quality 
improvement, however, is used to improve (or optimize) an existing process. 
 
Given the project is not a formal QI project, an aim statement was not provided and QI tools were not 
used.  DPHCS acknowledged the use of PDSA throughout the comprehensive data collection and 
analysis process.  Since this is a multi-year research study, results are not yet in. It would be helpful 
to include QI project criteria that includes: baseline data, the target is not being met, a project is 
prioritized through use of QI plan project selection process and a team is formed to lead and oversee 
the project.     
Response to Questions from Health Department 
 
The department requested information on the following: tracking performance measures over time and 
retaining staff buy in. We want to share several resources that provide peer-to-peer support and/or other 
PM/QI best practices. 
 
The Public Health Foundation (PHF) has developed a toolkit and website to assist health departments in 
selecting performance measures. This tool kit also provides information on how to track measures over time. 
You can find more information at Public Health Foundation Performance Measures Toolkit Website.   
PHF also has a Performance Management Toolkit to support health department develop and maintain a 
robust performance management system, including staff buy in. 
 
NACCO published a paper Measuring What Matters-2018 to support local health departments in selecting 
impactful measures.  
 
If you are not already a part of the Public Health Performance Improvement Network, we encourage your 
team to become members.  The Public Health Performance Improvement Network (phPIN) is a learning 
community and peer exchange network for those of you providing leadership in performance improvement in 
public health. phPIN offers a forum for innovative performance improvement practitioners in public health to 
network, access just-in-time resources, and share emerging practices on the topics of most interest to you: 
 
Performance management 
 
Quality improvement 
 
Accreditation

 
Community health assessment and improvement planning 
 
Workforce development plans and training 
Submit an application to join the phPIN network and online portal » 
This may be the ideal space to discuss with other health departments how to best address staff engagement.  
 
American Society for Quality is also an excellent resource for quality improvement trainings and provides tips 
on when to conduct QI in different settings.    
 
Other Comments  
 
DPHCS was selected as a Kresge Foundation Emerging Leaders in Public Health Transformative Initiative 
Award. The department focused this award on becoming a Chief Public Health Strategist for the region with 
an emphasis on becoming a trauma informed community. DPHCS's participation in this effort has 
strengthened stakeholder relationships and enhanced how the department engages the community in 
identifying needs and developing solutions. In addition, this work has created a data driven process to 
address emergent public health issues in the region. Nashua has seen more than double the national 
average increase in the suicide rate. This led the Mayor to forming a suicide prevention taskforce to develop 
community driven solutions to reduce isolation and improve well-being. Excellent! 
 
DPHCS has also continued to strengthen their data transparency and partnered with LiveStories to make an 
interactive dashboard available to the community, reporting on public health priorities.  This dashboard is 
expected to launch during public health week in April 2020.   
 
Continue your health department’s work with the population health outcomes tracking. As you prepare for 
reaccreditation, please consult PHAB’s resources related to population health outcomes reporting (including 
the reaccreditation orientation module, a tip sheet, several webinars on this topic, and other documents 
available through Bridge, PHAB’s online learning management system). For example, you will note that the 
format for reporting in e-PHAB during reaccreditation is different: You will select from a list of broad areas and 
topics. In addition, the target should be written as a SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and 
time-bound) goal. 
 
PHAB has launched a Data Portal, which allows you to see graphic representations of how your health 
department was assessed on the Standards and Measures. It also allows you to benchmark your 
performance against groups of health departments that have similar demographics as your agency. You can 
look at measures grouped by standard, domain, and theme. When you select a group of measures, you’ll see 
a list of resources that might help your health department in its improvement efforts. This can be accessed at 
phabdata.org.  
 
With the alignment of the Annual Report to specific reaccreditation measures, and as you prepare for 
reaccreditation, don’t forget to look back at your answers to questions such as question 13. While the 
conformity of the measure wasn’t assessed in the Annual Report, the descriptions were very well-written, 
detailed and laid out.  
 
Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, kudos to the City of Nashua Division of Public Health and Community 
Services for their ongoing prevention, mitigation and response efforts. Please feel free to share your health 
department’s COVID-19 story with PHAB: https://phaboard.org/accredited-health-departments-in-the-news/

The Nashua Welfare Department assisted 5 families and 4 individuals in emergency housing 
placements and referred 1 family and 3 individuals to public shelters during the month of May.  
Department staff works closely with Coordinated Entry workers, shelter providers and other 
housing programs to move households out of homelessness and into alternative shelter and 
transitional or permanent housing as soon as possible.  Staff continues to evaluate and assist 
applicants with a focus on keeping people housed and prevention of homelessness. 
 
The Welfare Department has expended $398,709.75 of the General Assistance (GA) budget, 
which is 74% of the total GA budget for FY2020. 
 
The Welfare Department continued operating under a modified schedule through the month of 
May.  This modified staggered schedule was set in place to maintain social distancing practices.  
Intakes, applications and eligibility determinations with clients continued to be completed 
virtually, over the telephone and via e-mail.  Department staff continued supporting other 
activities within the Division in response to COVID-19, including covering the COVID Hotline, 
calling individuals with results from testing at the clinics, and following up on contact 
investigations under direction from the Community Health Department.   
 
While the emergency order issued by Governor Sununu reduced the urgency of need for 
eviction/rental assistance and utility assistance, department staff continued to send out 
18 Mulberry Street • Nashua, New Hampshire 03060 • Phone (603) 589-4555 • Fax (603) 594-3643 
 
3 
application packets and assess client eligibility.  The Welfare Officer and department staff were 
in communication with community social service agencies to determine the need for assistance, 
make referrals, and intervene and assist where appropriate.  As emergency orders are changed 
or lifted, we expect the number of requests for rental and utility assistance to increase.  Staff 
will evaluate assistance for those in need and continue to work with community partners. 
 
The COVID Homeless Task Force, led by the Welfare Officer, suspended activities and any 
potential needs for the homeless population during this COVID response will be directed to 
previously existing resources designed to address issues for this population, such as the Greater 
Nashua Continuum of Care, the Ending Homelessness Committee and the Coordinated Entry 
process.  Agencies dealing with this population that have programmatic needs, such as cleaning 
supplies and PPE, have been referred to the Community Resources Task Force, which has been 
addressing many of these needs throughout this event.  Needs for the homeless population is 
being monitored and the COVID Homeless Task Force can reconvene if necessary. 
 
 
The Welfare Department continues to provide assistance in accordance with RSA165 and the 
City of Nashua Welfare Guidelines to those who are in need and unable to support themselves.  
Welfare staff continues to work closely with community partners directing clients to apply for 
assistance through programs to offset the need for Municipal Welfare assistance.
