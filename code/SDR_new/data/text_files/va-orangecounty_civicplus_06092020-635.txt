ORDINANCE TO INCREASE COURTHOUSE SECURITY FEE 
The Board of Supervisors will consider the adoption of an ordinance to increase the

may assess a courthouse security fee whenever a person is found guilty of a criminal or 
traffic offense, which is collected by the courts and appropriated to the Sheriff’s Office. Said 
ordinance proposes an increase from $10 to $20 in order to align with State legislation. 
 
HEARING #2  
EASEMENT TO RAPPAHANNOCK ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE 
The Board of Supervisors will consider the conveyance of an underground service 
easement on County-owned property at 27531 Constitution Highway to Rappahannock 
Electric Cooperative, by way of Service Easement and Responsibilities Agreement. Said 
easement will be used to connect power to the node cabinet site located on the property. 
 
HEARING #3  
SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION AND BUDGET AMENDMENT 
Pursuant to §15.2-2507 of the Code of Virginia, the Board of Supervisors will consider a 
budget amendment and supplemental appropriation to the FY20 Budget related to the 
COVID-19 response. The project-length budget is intended to cover expenditures related 
to the County’s response from Spring 2020 through December 31, 2020. Said budget 
amendment will consist of appropriation of Federal CARES Act funds ($3,288,743) to be
