The City of Stanwood is the commercial and cultural center of the greater Stanwood / Camano and the 
northern Snohomish County region. It is the desire of the City to preserve the community’s historic rural, small 
town character while promoting the regions as a wholesome place to live, work, shop and play.   
 
Over the last 10 years the City has developed an 
economic development strategy to promote the 
vitality of Stanwood’s business districts and 
neighborhoods. A substantial amount of community 
volunteer hours went into crafting a vision for 
Stanwood’s future. 
 
Following the guidance laid out in these plans, the City 
is moving forward with an action plan referred to as 
the Stanwood City Beautification Action Program. It 
consists of 5 key program elements: 
• Gateway Signage and Landscaping 
• Main Street Revitalization 
• Downtown Gateway Features 
• SR 532 Beautification 
• Wayfinding Signage

These five components generally consist of the following work elements:  
 
Gateway Signage:  Create gateway signage based off of the historic “Velkomen” sign, with a connection to the 
Snow Goose wayfinding signage, at the entrances to the City on SR 532:  Camano Island and Snohomish 
County.  Gateway signage should include local community service group logos such as Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, 
and American Legion.  
 
Wayfinding Signage:  Continue implementation of the Snow Goose wayfinding signage program. Phase 1 was 
completed in 2013 along SR 532 and Pioneer Highway.  Phase 2 along 271st Street and Phase 3 in the Hill Top 
area were identified as future wayfinding areas directing traffic to local businesses.  Part of the wayfinding 
program should include options for event advertising at predetermined locations. Beautification of the signage 
should include landscaping, trees and art that is appropriate for the various wayfinding signage options. 
 
SR 532 Beautification:  Improve the aesthetic quality of the SR 532 right-of-way within the City limits.  SR 532 
is the main road connecting residents to each end of town and portrays the first impression of the City to 
tourists coming into town.  Envisioned beautification efforts include: colorful street trees at key nodes / 
intersections, street trees or colorful shrubbery in the landscape islands / parkways sections of SR 532, and/or 
light pole banners.  
 
City Streetscape Beautification: Improve the aesthetic quality of the City’s local streets and create a gateway 
into the downtown shopping districts.  Neighborhoods would be encouraged to celebrate their uniqueness by:  
installing street trees, flower baskets, or flower pots; painting murals which depict local history or community 
character; installing mini library boxes; installing etched rocks; or other similar public improvements which 
enhance the visual appearance of the streetscape.  
 
Another element of the Streetscape Beautification element is the Main Street Revitalization project which 
consists of reconfiguring 271st Street to create a pedestrian friendly street that includes wide walkable 
sidewalks, allows for community festivals, connects the east and west business districts and promotes the 
concept of buying local.  Project elements include reconfiguring 271st Street travel lanes, building wider 
sidewalks and plaza areas, building park areas, installing street trees and planter boxes.   
 
Gateway Features:  Gateway features should be used to signify special places such as city entrances, shopping 
districts, or roundabouts.  They should be used sparingly to identify places as special. Features could include 
gateway arches and/or art sculptures.

Creative Use of Street ROW During the COVID-19 Pandemic
June 3, 2020 by Steve Butler
Category: Streets and Sidewalks , COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has had 
many negative effects on our national 
and local economies. Restaurants, 
espresso/coffee shops, and other 
business establishments serving food 
and beverages have been hit hard, 
with many having to close and only a 
limited number being financially able 
to offer “pick-up/to-go” service. The 
next wave of Safe Start -
Washington's Phased 
Reopening program means those food 
and beverage service establishments, 
(hereafter referred to as restaurants) can begin to provide some level of in-house service, subject to several 
conditions.
One challenge is that many restaurants, especially small ones, may not have enough interior space to easily meet 
the six-foot social distancing standard even when operating at only a 50% capacity level. If a restaurant could shift 
some of its tables onto the public right-of-way (ROW), however, it would be easier to follow social distancing 
guidelines and accommodate enough customers to make operations financially viable.
As a result, some local governments are considering allowing restaurants to extend their activities into the public 
ROW on a temporary basis. In a downtown context, the ROW usually consists of sidewalks, on-street parking spaces, 
and vehicular travel lanes, extending from the front of a building out to the street centerline. Of course, any new 
outdoor seating would be subject to the same coronavirus-related requirements as indoor seating.
Where Outdoor ROW Seating Is Currently Allowed
In Washington State, Langley, Spokane, and Vancouver are some of the cities that are either allowing restaurants to 
temporarily expand into the ROW or seriously considering that option, while our municipal neighbor to the south, 
Portland, already has such a program in place. Other U.S. cities, such as Cincinnati, Denver, and Tampa, have recently 
given businesses (including restaurants and, in some cases, retail goods display) the option to extend into adjacent 
sidewalks, streets, and parking lots.
Three Basic Approaches

ATTACHMENT B
There are three ways that the public ROW could be used by restaurants for outdoor seating: via sidewalks, on-street 
parking spaces, or the entirety of the ROW.
1. Use of sidewalks
This option would involve allowing seating for diners on a portion of a sidewalk, which would result in some practical 
difficulties and challenges. Providing safe pedestrian access within a business district while also maintaining a six-
foot minimum distance between seated patrons and pedestrians (within a standard sidewalk’s width) makes it 
difficult to place dining tables on most sidewalks. Unless you are dealing with a very wide pedestrian way, this 
physical challenge is the primary reason why most communities are viewing the use of an on-street parking area 
within the ROW (i.e., using parklets) as a better option than putting tables within a portion of a sidewalk (see below).
2. Use of on-street parking spaces (parklets)
This approach of using on-street parking (be it parallel, diagonal, or straight-in) to create a public space is usually 
referred to as creating a “parklet,” although some communities distinguish the use of such space for outdoor eating 
as a “streatery,” blending the words “street” and “eatery”. This is not a new concept, with a few cities in Washington 
(and elsewhere in the U.S.) already allowing this type of use, such as Seattle and Spokane.

3. Use of the entire right-of-
way
Some communities have limited 
vehicular access on one or two blocks 
of their downtown streets and only 
allow pedestrians and bicyclists to use 
them. Cincinnati has closed some of 
its streets, both partially and fully, and 
is allowing their use for street cafes. 
Closer to home, Coupeville will be temporarily closing off a section of Front Street to cars during June, 2020, to 
allow local restaurants and retail businesses to use a portion of it.
There is actually a fourth option to encourage outdoor dining: If there is private, off-street parking to the rear or side 
of a restaurant, some local governments are allowing a portion or all of those lots to be converted from parking to 
outdoor dining use.
Issues to be Considered
Before opening the ROW, local governments should carefully consider many issues, including access and how to 
communicate the new policy to residents and businesses.
Communicating program goals to the public
Page 2 of 5
MRSC - Creative Use of Street ROW During the COVID-19 Pandemic
6/4/2020
http://mrsc.org/Home/Stay-Informed/MRSC-Insight/June-2020/Creative-Use-of-the-ROW-...
It will be important to talk to your local 
business community (including those 
businesses that would directly benefit 
from outdoor dining in the ROW, 
along with those who would not), key 
governmental staff, and the general 
public about what you are considering. 
Be sure to ask what may be needed, 
solicit ideas, and get everyone’s 
opinions.
Ensuring access for people 
with disabilities
It is important that the outdoor 
seating areas be made accessible to 
people with physical disabilities, as demonstrated in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 2010 Standards for 
Accessible Design. For example, a parklet should be constructed so that it is flush with the sidewalk. If that is not 
possible, then an ADA-accessible ramp should be built to allow access to the parklet.
Allowing liquor licenses
Serving alcohol in these new public areas will require approval from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis 
Board (LCB). Its Adding or Extending Outside Liquor Service webpage provides information about how businesses 
can apply to add or extend outside liquor service, and decisions on such requests are being expedited by the Board.
Minimizing barriers to program use
Local rules and procedures should make it very clear what is and is not required to participate in your program. In 
particular, be sure to clarify what spatial requirements will be applied to any outdoor dining areas (one idea would be 
to develop a one- or two-page summary sheet, with easy-to-understand graphics). Reducing or waiving the 
program’s application fees may be another step to consider.
How to Implement
You don’t necessarily have to “reinvent the wheel” to create an outdoor space in the public ROW for business use. 
Instead, a local government should consider using current processes if there are already existing permits and 
programs. Examples of such processes include temporary-use permits, temporary traffic permits, sidewalk cafe 
licensing, and an existing parklet/streatery program. If you want to create a new program or modify an existing one, 
you may need to take official action through an ordinance, resolution, or motion. Some cities have changed their 
standards, as seen in this general proclamation from the City of Langley or this City of Spokane Executive Order. I 
would recommend that you consult with your legal counsel on the best approach for your jurisdiction.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major disruption in our daily lives and local businesses, such as restaurants, 
have been particularly hard hit. Even with the lifting of state restrictions over the next few months, it may still be 
difficult for restaurants and similar businesses to operate in a financially viable manner. Most local governments have 
shown themselves to be flexible and open to new ideas during the pandemic. Allowing the ROW to be used for 
public seating by restaurants and retail businesses may be a new idea that is worthy of serious consideration.

Introduction 
 
The City of Stanwood is the commercial and cultural center of the greater Stanwood / Camano 
and the northern Snohomish County region. It is the desire of the City to preserve the 
community’s historic rural, small town character while promoting the regions as a wondrous 
place to live, work, shop and play.   
 
Over the last 10 years the City has conceptualized 
economic development strategies to promote the 
vitality of Stanwood’s Main Street business districts 
and neighborhoods. A substantial amount of 
community volunteer hours went into crafting a vision 
for Stanwood’s future. 
 
Using guidance from these plans, the City is moving 
forward with an action plan referred to as the 
Stanwood City Beautification Action Program. It 
consists of 5 key program elements: 
• Gateway Signage and Landscaping 
• Main Street Revitalization

Downtown Subarea Plan 
 
The Main Street Revitalization element of the plan consists of reconfiguring 271st Street and 
270th Street to create a pedestrian friendly street that includes wide walkable sidewalks, allows 
for community festivals, connects the east and west business districts and promotes the 
concept of buying local.  Project elements include reconfiguring 271st Street travel lanes, 
building wider sidewalks and plaza areas, building park areas, installing landscaped medians, 
street trees and planter boxes.   
 
Achieving full build-out of the Beautification Action Plan will take time and significant 
resources, hence the Main Street Revitalization project is being broken into multiple project 
phases.  The first of which is a pilot program to test the business community and the public’s 
desire to temporally convert some of the parking spaces along 271st Street and 270th Street into 
useable public spaces.  This concept is commonly known as Parklets.  A Parklet is a sidewalk 
extension that provides more space and amenities for people using the street. Usually Parklets 
are installed on parking lanes and use several parking spaces.  
This guidebook sets out the process and requirements for building a Parklet in the City of 
Stanwood.

Program Overview 
 
As a business retention and economic 
recovery tool for local businesses, the City of 
Stanwood is initiating a pilot project 
temporarily allowing businesses to extend 
their store fronts out into the adjacent public 
parking spaces in the east and west end 
business districts to create Parklets.  Parklets 
are public or private seating platforms that 
convert curbside parking spaces into vibrant 
community spaces such as café seating, open 
seating areas, art space or other public 
amenities. 
 
 
Parklet Concept with General Open Seating 
The City has selected Main Street for the 
pilot project because these Parklets would 
be located in areas next to our historic retail 
shops where there pedestrian activity is 
encouraged.  
 
Parklets are allowed in the following 
locations: 
1. 271st Street between 84th Avenue 
(Florence Road Near the Train 
Station) to 88th Avenue; and 
2. 270th Street between 99th Avenue 
and 102nd Drive 
 
Parklet Concept with General Open  
Seating Using Angled Parking Stalls 
 
Parklets can be used in one of two ways: 
open seating for the public, or private 
seating controlled by the business and used 
for serving food and beverages.  
 
The remainder of this guide established the 
design requirements for Parklets, permit 
procedures and the sponsor’s 
responsibilities.

Process Overview 
 
Installing a Parklet requires coordination with the City and the adjacent neighbors.  There are 
three steps major steps in the design, permitting and construction of a Parklet.   
 
Step 1: Parklet Concepts and Meet with Neighbors: 
Main Street parking is shared by all businesses and removing parking may be a concern of 
neighboring businesses.  Parklet Sponsors are required to inform nearby property owners and 
businesses, the Chamber of Commerce, and residents regarding your intention to propose a 
Parklet. Having a prepared schematic of your design helps to clearly articulate your Parklet 
vision! 
As part of the Parklet application, a sponsor is required to submit a letter of support for the 
project from business owners on either side of your business.  Early communication with your 
neighbors helps avoid permit delays. 
 
Step 2: Design Development and Permitting 
Once you’ve met with your neighbors to determine if your project is viable, call City Hall to set 
up a General Development Meeting.  City staff will meet with you to review your proposal and 
discuss any issues with parking, traffic, Parklet maintenance and Parklet building design.  Please 
note that all Parklets must be designed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA) standards for accessibility as well as City regulations.  
After the General Development Meeting, assemble and submit your Parklet application when 
ready.  Staff will endeavor to review and approve the proposal within two to three weeks. 
When your Parklet design has been approved, the permit will be issued and you may begin the 
third step: construction.  
 
Step 3:  Fabrication, Installation and Maintenance 
After the Parklet permit is issued, you have up to two months to begin constructing your 
Parklet. There will be a site inspection prior to and after construction. Parklet Sponsors must 
have an ongoing maintenance plan on file with the City.  
Enjoy your Parklet!

Design Requirements 
 
Parklets are intended to be seen as pieces of street furniture providing aesthetic enhancements 
to the overall streetscape. In place of car parking, a platform is built to extend the grade of the 
sidewalk into the street. Once the platform is installed, benches, tables, chairs, landscaping, and 
bike parking can all be placed on top in order to create a Parklet. 
The design, costs and installation of Parklets are the responsibility of the business sponsor.  For 
Parklets to function safely, the following design requirements must be followed.   However, this 
does not mean that projects need to be dull or boring; Parklets should include creative designs 
that enhances the streetscape. Think beyond the standard tables and chairs on a platform.  Use 
of historic references, color, and plantings are encouraged.  
 
 
Impact on Adjacent Businesses: 
As part of the Parklet application, a sponsor is required to submit a letter of support for the 
project from business owners on either side of your business.  Early communication with your 
neighbors helps avoid permit delays. 
 
 
Separation and Protection from Vehicles: 
Parklets are sited along the curbside on streets where on-street parking spaces exist and next 
to busy travel lanes.  Safety is of utmost importance. Therefore, setbacks from the street and 
other parking stalls is required.   
• Parklets located in perpendicular or diagonal parking spaces shall be designed to be the 
size of two to three combined parking spaces to maximize habitable space 
• Parklets shall include wheel stops with embed reflective candlesticks. 
• The edge of the Parklet must be set back 3 feet from the adjacent angled parking space 
or 4 feet on parallel parking spaces on either side.  
• The platform design must include a physical buffer along the street while maintaining 
clear visual sightlines to the street.  
• Additional traffic safety measures may be required by the City Engineer upon review of 
the application.  
• Install 2 safe-hit posts; one on each end of the parking space.  Posts shall include 
reflection strips and be a minimum of 36 inches tall.  Final designs shall be approved by 
the City Engineer.

Accessibility: 
Parklets are public spaces and must be accessible to and be usable by individuals with 
disabilities.  As such all Parklets must be designed and constructed to conform to the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA).   
•  All Parklets must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and be 
accessible to all users, including people with physical disabilities, wheelchair users, and 
those with impaired vision.  
• At least 50% of the platform must be flush with the adjacent sidewalk for wheelchair 
access.  
• Furniture must be able to accommodate those with disabilities, wheelchairs, or mobility 
devices.  
• Platform cross slopes cannot exceed two (2) percent. Your final construction drawings 
will need to show spot elevations for both the sidewalk and the platform areas.  
• Platform decking must be flush with the curb and may not have more than ½ inch gap 
from the curb.  
 
 
Design, Aesthetics and Amenities: 
Parklets are intended to promote public use; amenities should include seating, planting, lighting 
or other elements that invite the public to gather and activate the street.  
• The platform shall include some vertical elements, such as planters and umbrellas, to be 
visible to passing vehicles. However these must not obstruct driver views.  
• Some form of permanent seating integrated into the Parklet structure is encouraged. 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
Access and Function of Public Facilities:  
Public works crews and emergency services 
will continue to need access to public 
infrastructure.  To ensure that public safety is 
not impaired, Parklets may not be constructed 
over utility access panels, manhole covers, 
storm drains or block access to fire hydrants.  
In addition, platform must be designed to 
allow for curb line stormwater drainage. A gap 
should be maintained between the body of 
the deck and the curb, to facilitate the 
movement of water.  
 
 
Platforms must be designed to accommodate the crown and cross slope of the street surface. 
Close attention must be paid to existing curb condition and height to ensure platform is flush 
with curb. 
 
 
 
Building Design and Materials: 
Parklets are intended to be aesthetic improvements to the streetscape and should be designed 
with high quality, durable materials capable of withstanding year‐round use and weather.   
• The platform may not extend beyond six (6) feet from the curb line. 
• The maximum length of the platform must not be longer than the street frontage of 
Sponsors establishment unless permission is granted by the adjacent property owner(s).  
• The design should not include any bolts/anchors or other elements that require 
disturbing the street surface or sidewalk.  
• No wall or rail may be lower than thirty-six (36) inches, as measured from the street.  
• Continuous opaque walls above forty-two (42) inches that block views into the Parklet 
from the surrounding streetscape are prohibited.  
• If cable railing is used, spacing between cables cannot exceed six (6) inches.  
• All rails must be capable of withstanding a 200 pound horizontal force.  
 
 
9 
• Platforms must be able to support 100 pound per square foot live load.  
• Sponsors shall have a strategy for removing graffiti and replacing or repairing damaged 
Parklet features such as plants, railings, floor boards, and furniture.   
• The platform design should allow for access and cleaning of the area underneath the 
platform.  
 
Prohibited Uses: 
For the peace and tranquility of the neighbors the following elements are not permitted:  
• Generators, combustible fuel, tents, canopies, awnings, bands, large speakers.   
• No elements may be stored on the sidewalk or on the street other than an allowance for 
a small planter on either side of the establishment’s main entrance that does not 
impede pedestrian traffic.    
• Nothing may be mounted or attached to the street, sidewalk, street posts, lights, or 
other public facilities in the Right of Way.
