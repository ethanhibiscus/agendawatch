Planning Commission 
Staff Report 
 
Conditional Use Permit for a Major Home Occupation ‘B’, 
Group Violin Lessons. 
June 11, 2020 
 
Applicant/Owner: 
 
McKenzie Clawson 
Location:                                 545 East 250 North 
Zone:  
R-1-8 (Single Family Residential) 
 
Description: 
 
The applicant is requesting a conditional use permit for Major Home Occupation “B” at the above listed 
address to offer violin lessons. Ms. Clawson plans to teach primarily one-on-one lessons to students a few 
days a week in the afternoon, but hopes to be able to hold a group session twice a month where a group 
as large as 10 students would be able to attend. 
 
Per KCC 7-26-4 (12) 3, organized classes are permitted by approval of the Planning Commission, but shall 
have a limit placed on the number of students and/or the number of vehicles transporting students to the 
home occupation to prevent congestion. 
 
 
Recommendation: 
 
Staff is recommending approval of the proposed conditional use permit for a Major Home Occupation “B” 
preschool, at the above listed address with the following condition: 
- 
Groups lessons be allowed only 3 days a month, and 
- 
Groups be limited to no more than 10 students at a time. 
- 
When doing group lessons, there must be a gap of at least 15 minutes after the last lesson and 
before the next lesson to allow for pick-up and drop-off to complete. 
 
Reasoning: 
 
The restrictions of the ordinance together with the recommended condition appear to be appropriate for 
mitigating potentially anticipated detrimental impacts.

Planning Commission 
Staff Report 
 
Public hearing for the rezone of 1.1 acres of property to 
include the PRUD overlay zone and Preliminary Plat. 
June 11, 2020 
 
Applicant/Owner: 
 
Applicant: Nathan Alvey – Owner: Lamont and Carolee Anderson 
Location:                                 1599 West Galbraith Lane 
Current Zone:  
R-A 
 
Description: 
The property includes an existing home fronting Galbraith Lane which is proposed to remain with some 
modifications while the primary purpose of the request for the PRUD overlay is to accommodate a new lot 
behind the home to the south. 
 
The underlying R-A zone would remain in effect. The proposed preliminary plat indicates 2 lots that each 
meet the minimum frontage or width requirement as well as the minimum acreage for the R-A zone. The 
flag lot provisions of the PRUD ordinance require that the standard lot fronting the street keep its typical 
standards for width and setbacks and the access to the new lot be provided at 30 feet in width to a single 
lot. Each lot must be at least 10,000 sq. ft. in size or meet the minimum for the zone which in this case is 
21,780 sq. ft. The property contains enough acreage and is wide enough to accommodate 2 lots which 
comply with the provisions of the applicable ordinances, but in order to meet the required side yard 
setback from a property line it is necessary to remove portions of the home as proposed on the 
preliminary plat. 
 
This area are multiple flag lots in the immediate area. There have also been concerns expressed to staff 
in recent years regarding water which collects in this section of town in the rear yards of properties along 
Leola St. which would be appropriate to consider with final plat details if the commission and council are 
on boards with pursuit of the idea of a flag lot at this location. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
The planning commission is tasked with considering 2 motions.  
 
First, the planning Commission should determine if the PRUD overlay zone is appropriate for the 
requested property based on its location and compatibility with the general plan. A recommendation on 
this option should be forwarded to the city council. 
 
Second, if the PRUD is found to be desirable, staff recommends that a recommendation of approval be 
forwarded to the city council for the preliminary plat with the condition that the existing home be 
modified before a final plat is recorded. (Final plat application and review would also be a necessary 
future step) 
 
2 
Reasoning: 
The rezone is a legislative decision so is open to interpretation of the commission. 
 
The plat is consistent with zoning requirements and meets applicable ordinances and standards.

Staff Report 
 
Public Hearing for the Rezone of 14 acres of property at 
approximately 1773 West 200 North from A-5 (Heavy 
Agriculture) to the R-1-10, R-1-14, R-1-6 (Single Family) 
zones and the R-2 (One and Two Family Residential) zone 
with the PRUD (Planned Residential Unit Development) 
overlay zone to be included over each district for Nephi 
Harvey and Malcolm Harvey.  
 
June 11, 2020 
 
Applicant/Owner: 
Nephi and Malcolm Harvey for Salt Grass Land & Cattle LLC 
 
 
Description: 
 
The applicants are requesting a rezone to multiple different zoning districts to accommodate their desire 
for a future residential development with a variety of lot sizes and housing types. The applicant has 
submitted a preliminary plat to demonstrate their desired use of the property which includes an 
anticipated 4 phases of development along public streets which are designed to create connections from 
existing stubbed dead ends to 200 North street. There are some private streets and common areas and 
varied lot sizes. At the request of staff to better predict and administer the type of development to occur 
each phase has been proposed to be regulated by a separate zoning district. 
 
Phase 1 which would be regulated by the R-1-10 district contains 9 lots ranging in size from 10,922 sq. ft. 
to 21,841 sq. ft. in size all along a standard public right of way. 
 
Phase 2 is proposed to be included in the R-2 district includes 55 lots in a townhome style configuration 
with common open space. Spread over 5.2 acres this phase has a density of 10.5 units an acre. 
 
Phase 3 is proposed to be in the R-1-14 district includes 8 lots ranging in size from 15,534 sq. ft. to 
23,325 sq. ft. in size. Most of the lots are accessed from a private cul-de-sac street. 
 
Phase 4 is proposed to be in the R-1-6 zoning district with 6 lots at 7,007 sq. ft. to 8,509 sq. ft. in size. 
 
All phases of the proposed preliminary plat are dependent upon approval of a rezone as the property 
currently requires that all divisions be to lots of at least 210,000 sq. ft. in size. 
 
 
2 
The specifics of the requested zoning districts are found as follows: 
 
R-1 districts: KCC 17-12 (Single Family Residential District) 
 
R-2 district: KCC 17-14 (One and Two Family Residential District) 
 
PRUD Overlay Zone: KCC 17-34 (Planned Residential Unit Development) 
 
In considering the rezone the Planning Commission should refer to the General Plan and look at the 
specifics of the proposed location to determine if the request is appropriate for the area. 
 
The City’s General Plan states, among other things: 
 
Identity and Character:  
Kaysville should be primarily a residential community with a vision to promote business, industry and 
public use. 
 
A. 
Housing: 
Housing should be located throughout the City and restricted only where it is 
incompatible with other necessary uses.  
 
1. West of I-15, allow for similar housing densities in existing neighborhoods while 
considering medium density housing along the major streets and higher density 
housing near transit stops and arterial streets (200 North, Interstate 15, and the 
West Davis Corridor). 
 
B. 
The majority of the housing should be single unit attached or detached.  The City will 
seek to provide a variety of housing choices throughout the community including a 
means for allowing homes of a variety of sizes.  Multiple unit housing should consist 
mostly of duplexes (two unit structures) and some three to six unit structures dispersed 
throughout the City. 
 
C. 
Housing development should have a minimum of through vehicular traffic and a 
maximum of open space. 
 
D. 
Housing developments should essentially pay for themselves. 
 
 
Consideration to Plan for Additional Moderate Income Housing which is a portion of the General Plan 
found through the link above may be appropriate for consideration as well. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
The Planning Commission is tasked with making a recommendation to the City Council addressing the 
rezone request based on its findings of compatibility with the General Plan and how well the proposal 
works at this specific location. 
 
If residential development as proposed is desired it is recommended that the Commission review the 
terms of the development agreement and consider whether or not additional stipulations are appropriate 
to control and regulate what may occur to the property over the course of its development. The Planning 
Commission may forward a recommendation to the council subject to the attached agreement as 
proposed, or may ask for additional details or changes to the agreement before making a 
recommendation. The Planning Commission may also recommend denial of the requested zoning if it 
finds that it is not in accord with the city’s General Plan or that it isn’t appropriate at the proposed 
location. 
 
3 
Should the zoning and terms of the development agreement be acceptable, the Planning Commission 
would recommend approval of a preliminary plat that meets the terms of the development agreement. 
While some more specific details would still need to be verified such as a verification of open space 
provided and verification of compliance with the standards of 17-34-7, the density and public street 
layout are acceptable to staff as proposed.

Staff Report 
 
Public hearing for the rezone of 1.5 acres of property to 
include the PRUD overlay zone and Preliminary and Final 
Plat for Bailey Subdivision. 
June 11, 2020 
 
Applicant/Owner: 
 
Blake Bailey 
Location:                                 1480 W Willow Drive 
Current Zone:  
R-1-20 
 
Description: 
The property is located at 1480 W Willow Drive and is currently zoned R-1-20. The existing lot is 66,806 
square feet in size. The applicant, Blake Bailey, is anticipating creating a new lot of 21,929 square feet 
with 143.5 feet of frontage. This will leave the existing home on a 45,672 square foot lot. The new 
proposed lot will face the private road in the new subdivision which is under construction to the south. 
Both the existing and new proposed lot meet the frontage and square footage requirements for the 
existing R-1-20 zoning district, however the PRUD overlay is needed as the access for the new lot will be 
off of the new private street. The owner has coordinated with the developer of developer of the property 
to the south for permission and ability to get utility services to the new proposed lot. 
 
The new lot facing Wooden Shoe Way North is deep enough to provide a building pad that meets the 
minimum dwelling size requirements of 17-31-16, Dwellings.  
 
All setbacks are standard for the R-1-20 zone with the exception of a 20 foot front yard set back 
requested along the private road consistent with 17-34-8 (d). 
 
 
Recommendation: 
 
The planning commission is tasked with considering 3 motions.  
 
First, the planning Commission should determine if the PRUD overlay zone is appropriate for the 
requested property based on its location and compatibility with the general plan. A recommendation on 
this option should be forwarded to the city council. 
 
Second, if the PRUD is found to be desirable, staff recommends that a recommendation of approval be 
forwarded to the city council for the preliminary plat. 
 
 
2 
Third, assuming the PRUD and preliminary plat are recommended for approval, staff recommends that 
the Planning Commission approve the final plat for the Baily Subdivision subject to final approval of the 
PRUD overlay zone and preliminary plat by the city council. 
 
Reasoning: 
The rezone is a legislative decision so is open to interpretation of the commission. 
 
The plat is consistent with zoning requirements and meets applicable ordinances and standards. 
 
 
Attachments: Area Map, Subdivision Plat, and Zoning Ordinance.

Staff Report 
 
Public Hearing for consideration of an ordinance enacting 
subsection 
19-5-7, 
Technical 
Specifications 
and 
Drawings, of Chapter 19-5, Subdivision Standards, of Title 
19, Subdivisions, of the Revised Ordinances of Kaysville 
City.  
 
June 11, 2020 
 
 
Description: 
 
Kaysville City has utilized standards specifying the way that public improvements such as streets and 
utilities are constructed that were adopted in 1994. These standards have been in file with Kaysville City 
and distributed upon request to developers or others doing work to build, maintain, and repair the city’s 
infrastructure.  
 
The proposed ordinance updates the standards and provides more clear detail and drawings that will be 
adopted by ordinance. This will make it easier for the standards to be found and make it more clear what 
the city expects. Many of the standards remain the same as they have served the city well for many 
years, one of the big changes is the requirement to install conduit to house future communications 
infrastructure. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
Kaysville City staff recommends approval of the proposed ordinance as prepared, with the understanding 
that some changes to formatting will be made before full adoption by the Kaysville City Council.

city infrastructure; and

WHEREAS, the Kaysville City Council desires to have communications conduit included with new

June 2020  
DIVISION 2a 
 
TRENCH EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL 
 
1.11 
GENERAL: 
 
This Division covers the requirements for trenching and backfilling for underground utilities. 
Unless otherwise directed by the City Engineer, pipe shall be laid in an open trench. All 
incidental clearing, preliminary grading, structure removal, and benching shall be considered a 
part of the trenching operation. 
 
1.12 
BARRICADES: 
 
It is the Developer’s responsibility to submit a traffic control plan to the City for approval at least 
forty-eight (48) hours prior to digging, and shall not commence until City approval is received. 
Barriers shall be placed at each end of all excavations and at such places as may be necessary 
along excavations to warn all pedestrians and vehicular traffic of such excavations. Warning 
signs shall also be installed placed on both sides of overhead lines to warn workers, operators, 
truck drivers etc. of potential dangers. Lights or reflective barricades shall also be placed along 
excavations from one hour before sunset each day to one hour after sunrise of the next day until 
such excavations are entirely refilled, compacted, and surfaced or final graded. All excavations 
shall be barricaded in such a manner as to prevent persons from falling, walking, or otherwise 
entering any excavation in any street, roadway, parking lot, or any other area, public or private. 
Impacted residents, businesses or other parties shall be contacted no less than twenty-four (24) 
hours prior to excavations that will impact utilities at or access to those properties. 
 
1.13 
BLASTING: 
 
Blasting will not be allowed except by permission from the City Engineer. The Developer shall 
comply with all laws, ordinances, and applicable safety code requirements and regulations 
relative to the handling, storage, and use of explosives and protection of life and property, and it 
shall be fully responsible for all damage attributable to its blasting operations. Excessive blasting 
or overshooting will not be permitted, and any material outside the authorized cross section 
which may be shattered or loosened by blasting shall be removed by the Developer. 
 
1.14 
SHEETING, BRACING AND SHORING OF EXCAVATIONS: 
 
Excavations shall be sheeted, braced, and shored as required to support the walls of the 
excavations, to eliminate sliding and settling and as may be required to protect the workmen, the 
work in progress, and existing utilities, structures and improvements. All such sheeting, bracing, 
and shoring shall comply with the requirements of the Utah Labor Commission, Occupational 
Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and accident prevention and safety provisions of the contract. 
 
The Developer shall be fully responsible for the adequacy of methods and materials used in 
trench sheeting, bracing, shoring, and/or other systems provided to protect workmen. Injury to or 
June 2020  
death of workmen resulting from inadequate trench safety measures shall be the full and 
complete responsibility of the Developer. 
 
All damages resulting from lack of adequate sheeting, bracing, and shoring shall be the 
responsibility of the Developer, and the Developer shall affect all necessary repairs or 
reconstruction at its own expense resulting from such damage. 
 
Sheeting or shoring that does not extend below the centerline of the pipe may be removed at the 
discretion and responsibility of the Developer after the trench backfill has been placed and 
compacted to a level twelve inches (12”) above the top of the pipe. Following removal of the 
sheeting or bracing, the trench shall be immediately backfilled and compacted or consolidated. 
 
1.15 
CONTROL OF GROUNDWATER: 
 
All trenches shall be kept free from water during excavation, fine grading, pipe laying and 
jointing, and pipe embedment operations. Where the trench bottom is mucky or otherwise 
unstable because of the presence of groundwater, and in all cases where the static groundwater is 
above the bottom of any trench or bell hole excavation, such groundwater shall be lowered to the 
extent necessary to keep the trench free from water and the trench bottom stable when the work 
within the trench is in progress. The discharge from excavation dewatering shall be conducted to 
natural drainage channels, gutters, or storm drains, in accordance with applicable water quality 
regulations and requirements. No sanitary sewer shall be used for disposal of trench water. If any 
evidence of contamination in the water based on olfactory or visual indication, cease excavation 
work until potential risks are evaluated. During evaluation, handle water as a contaminated 
material.  Surface water shall be prevented from entering trenches. 
 
1.16 
TRENCH EXCAVATION 
 
Excavation for pipelines shall follow the line and grade shown on the approved plans. Trenches 
shall be excavated to the depths and widths required to accommodate construction of the 
pipelines, as follows: 
 
A. 
Authorized Over-Excavation: 
 
Excavation for trenches in ledge rock, cobble rock, stones, or other material 
unsatisfactory for pipe foundation shall extend to a depth of at least six inches (6”) below 
the bottom of the pipe. Where unstable earth or muck is encountered in the excavation at 
the grade of the pipe, a minimum of twelve inches (12”) below grade will be removed. 
Such over-excavation and placing imported special foundation material shall not be made 
except as directed by the City Engineer or their designee. Over-excavations not ordered, 
specified, or shown shall be handled the same as unauthorized over-excavation. 
June 2020  
 
B. 
Unauthorized Over-Excavation: 
 
Where any unauthorized excavation is carried below the elevation required to install the 
pipe to the grade shown on the plans, specified in these specifications or directed by the 
City Engineer, the excavation shall be backfilled in accordance with these specifications 
for “Imported Granular Material” and “Gravel Foundation for Pipelines and Pipeline 
Structures,” all at the Developer’s expense. 
 
C. 
Trench Width: 
 
The trench shall be excavated such that the pipe is always centered in the trench. The 
clear trench width at the horizontal diameter of the pipe must be equal to eighteen inches 
(18”) on either side. If a trench is excavated to a greater width, the Developer will be 
required to restore the trench to an acceptable condition by following the steps outlined in 
these specifications for “Trenches in Embankments.” 
 
Trench width for pipeline structures, valves, or other accessories shall be sufficient to 
leave at least twelve inches (12”) clear between their outer surfaces and the trench. 
Backfill with native soil or excavated spoils under structures, pipes or valves will not be 
permitted. Any unauthorized excess excavation below the elevation indicated for 
foundation of any structures shall be backfilled in accordance with these specifications 
for “Imported Granular Materials,” and “Gravel Foundation Pipelines and Pipeline 
Structures,” all at the Developer’s expense. 
 
D. 
Trenches in Embankments: 
 
Before laying pipes that are to be in fill or embankment areas, the embankment shall first 
be placed and compacted to the specified density to a depth of not less than two feet (2’) 
above the top of the proposed pipe. After placing and compacting the embankment, the 
trench for the pipe or conduit shall be excavated through the fill and fine graded and the 
pipe installed as specified. 
 
E. 
Placement of Excavated Material: 
 
All excess excavated material not fit for use in construction shall be hauled away from 
the construction site and disposed of in an area obtained by the Developer. The 
Developer shall be responsible for all rights-of-way, easements, and access associated 
with the disposal of excess excavated material. It shall further be responsible to obtain 
permission from the property owner or person(s) controlling the property where the 
Developer plans to dispose of excavated material. 
 
Otherwise, excavated material shall be piled in a manner that will not endanger the work, 
will avoid obstructing sidewalks, driveways and streets and will comply with all 
applicable water quality rules and regulations. Gutters and irrigation ditches shall be kept 
clear for street drainage and continuity of irrigation. 
June 2020  
 
Grading of the area surrounding the trenches, including excavated materials, shall be 
performed as necessary to prevent surface water from flowing into trenches, or other 
excavations.  Control of groundwater shall be as specified herein. 
 
F. 
Fine Grading the Trench Bottom: 
 
The bottom of the Trench shall be accurately graded and prepared to provide uniform 
bearing and support on undisturbed soil or compacted gravel foundation at every point 
along the entire length of the pipe. Bell holes shall be hand excavated after the trench 
bottom has been fine graded.  Bell holes shall be only large enough to permit making the 
joints and to assure that the pipe is not supported by any portion of the joint or bell. 
 
1.17 
TRENCH BACKFILL 
 
A. 
Imported Granular Material: 
 
1.  General.  When the excavated materials are not satisfactory for pipe 
foundation, pipe bedding or backfill, as determined by the Engineer, the 
Developer shall provide imported granular material.  Imported granular material 
for foundation, bedding and backfill shall be cleaned, crushed rock or gravel free 
from sod, vegetation and other organic or deleterious material.  Slag will not be 
allowed in the pipe zone. 
 
 
2.  Gradation.  Imported granular material shall conform to the following 
gradation specifications: 
 
 
 
Gravel Foundation Material: 
 
 
One hundred (100) percent passing a one (1) inch screen and five (5) 
percent passing a one half (1/2) inch screen. 
 
 
 
Gravel Bedding Material: 
 
Ductile Iron or concrete pipe - One hundred (100) percent passing a one 
(1) inch screen and five (5) percent passing a No. 4 sieve. 
 
PVC or polyethylene pipe - One hundred (100) percent passing a three 
quarter (3/4) inch screen and five (5) percent passing a No. 4 sieve. 
 
Copper tubing - One hundred (100) percent passing a three quarter (3/4) 
inch screen and five (5) percent passing a No. 4 sieve. 
 
 
 
Gravel Backfill Material: 
 
June 2020  
One hundred (100) percent passing a three (3) inch square sieve and 
fifteen (15) percent passing a 200 mesh sieve. 
 
B. 
Gravel Foundation for Pipe and Pipeline Structures: 
 
The Gravel foundation is defined as fill material below the bottom of the pipe, pipeline 
structure or accessory.  Wherever the trench is excavated below the subgrade for the pipe, 
pipeline structure, or accessory the subgrade shall be replaced with crushed rock or gravel 
to an elevation sufficiently above the bottom of the pipe so that the trench can be properly 
fine graded as specified and the pipe will be true to line and grade.  The gravel material 
shall be deposited over the entire trench width in layers.  The layers shall have a 
maximum un-compacted thickness of six (6) inches.  The gravel material is to be 
compacted using vibratory equipment to 96% of the maximum index density of the 
material as determined by ASTM D4253 (Relative Density Test). 
 
The material shall then be fine graded in accordance with the specification for Fine 
Grading herein. 
 
C. 
Pipe Bedding: 
 
Pipe bedding is fill material in the pipe zone.  The pipe zone is defined as the area from 
the bottom of the pipe to twelve (12) inches above the top of the pipe, or any area within 
twelve (12) inches of any pipe, pipeline structure or accessory. 
 
Excavated materials consisting of loose earth, sand or gravel having no material larger 
than two (2) inches in any dimension, no greater than one (1) inch in any dimension for 
PVC pipe or no greater than one half (1/2) inch for copper tubing may be considered for 
use as pipe bedding material. The City Engineer, or their designee, shall qualify 
excavated material for use as bedding. 
 
If the excavated materials are not satisfactory, imported granular material as specified 
herein shall be used for pipe bedding. When gravel is used around pipe bedding, the 
Developer must place a fabric over gravel layer to keep fines from washing into gravel, 
creating a void. Fabric must be at least a two hundred (200) pound tensile strength woven 
ground stabilization fabric (in accordance with AASHTO M 288) and shall be installed 
on top of gravel prior to sand or roadbase placement. 
 
After the pipe is in place, bedding material shall be placed at any point below the mid-
point of the pipe simultaneously and uniformly on both sides of the pipe in un-compacted 
layers not to exceed ten (10) inches or one half (1/2) the diameter of the pipe, whichever 
is less.  Bedding material shall be placed with care to prevent displacement of or damage 
to the pipe during the bedding process.  Material shall be scattered alongside the pipe and 
not dropped into the trench in compact masses. 
 
June 2020  
That section of the pipe zone from the mid-point of the pipe to twelve (12) inches above 
the top of the pipe shall then be filled with bedding materials and compacted to the 
density required in these specifications for backfill in this section of the trench. 
 
D. 
Trench Backfill: 
 
The trench shall be backfilled from twelve (12) inches above the top of the pipe to the 
natural surface level or the finished grade specified on the approved drawings.  Excavated 
materials consisting of good sound earth, sand, and gravel may be used for backfill.  No 
oil cake, asphalt, concrete, rocky, clay or other lumpy material may be used in the 
backfill.  Perishable or spongy material shall not be used in backfilling. The City 
Engineer, or their designee, shall qualify excavated material for use as backfill. 
 
Under pavements, shoulders or other surface improvements, the in-place density shall be 
a minimum of ninety-six (96) percent of laboratory standard maximum dry density as 
determined by AASHTO T-180 (ASTM D1557).  In shoulders and other areas the in-
place density shall be a minimum of ninety (90) percent of the maximum dry density as 
determined by AASHTO T-180 (ASTM D1557). The backfill in the trenches shall be 
either compacted or consolidated according to the requirements of the materials being 
placed. 
 
Density and compaction testing shall be done at a frequency of one (1) test per two 
hundred (200) lineal feet of trench. 
 
E. 
Compaction of Backfill: 
 
Backfill shall be compacted by means of sheepsfoot rollers, pneumatic tire rollers, 
vibrating rollers, or mechanical tampers. Where compaction methods are used, the 
material shall be placed at a moisture content and un-compacted lift thickness such that 
after compaction the required relative densities will be produced.  In no event will the 
material be placed in lifts which, prior to compaction, exceed twelve (12) inches. 
 
Prior to compaction each layer shall be evenly spread, moistened, and worked by disk 
harrowing or other equivalent means. 
 
If the required relative density is not attained, test sections will be required to determine 
any adjustments in compaction equipment, thickness of layers, moisture content, and 
compactive effort necessary to attain the specified minimum relative density. 
 
Approval of equipment, thickness of layers, moisture content, and compactive effort shall 
not be deemed to relieve the Developer of the responsibility for attaining the specified 
minimum relative densities.  The Developer, in planning its work, shall allow sufficient 
time to perform the work connected with test sections and to permit the City Engineer or 
their designee to make tests for relative densities. 
 
 
June 2020  
F. 
Consolidation of Backfill: 
 
Consolidation of backfill, when authorized by the City Engineer, shall be accomplished 
by those methods in which water is used as the essential agent to produce the desired 
condition of density and stability. Water shall be applied by jetting unless flooding is 
specifically authorized by the City Engineer. Authorization by the City Engineer to use 
any consolidation method does not relieve the Developer of their responsibility to meet 
the specified density requirements. Water for consolidation shall be furnished by the 
Developer at their expense. 
 
In the jetting procedure the jets shall be inserted at not more than four (4) foot intervals 
(staggered throughout the length of the backfilled area) and shall be slowly forced down 
to the bottom of the trench or to of the previously jetted lift and held until the trench 
backfill is completely saturated with water. Depth of a jetted lift shall not exceed five (5) 
feet. 
 
The minimum size of hose equipment shall be such as to provide a minimum pressure of

be filled, mounded over and wheel rolled to compact the material thus placed. 
 
All precautions necessary shall be taken by the Developer to prevent damage and 
movement (including floating) of the pipeline, structures, and existing adjacent 
improvements and utilities. The allowance of the use of consolidation methods shall not 
be construed as guaranteeing or implying that the use of such methods will not result in 
damage to the adjacent ground. The Developer shall make their own determination in this 
regard and shall assume all risks and liability for settlement or lateral movement of 
adjacent ground, or improvements, or utilities, either on the surface of the ground or 
underground. 
 
1.18 
TRENCH CROSSINGS AND EASEMENTS: 
 
At road crossings or where existing driveways occur on a road, the Developer shall make 
provisions for trench crossings either by means of backfills, tunnels, or temporary bridges. 
 
When excavating within easements, the Developer shall carefully remove all shrubs, fences, and 
other above ground items, carefully cut and remove any lawn sod and remove the topsoil for a 
depth of at least twelve (12) inches (or the depth of the actual topsoil if less than twelve (12) 
inches with the width of the lawn sod and/or topsoil removal being at least two (2) feet wider 
(one (1) foot each side) than the excavated trench width and excavated material pile.  The lawn 
sod and topsoil material shall be piled separately from and shall not be mixed with the remainder 
of the excavated material. 
 
June 2020  
When working in already developed areas on private property the City Engineer may require that 
following completion of the backfilling and the compaction of the trench, the Developer shall 
replace topsoil, lawn sod, shrubs, fences, and other items that may have been removed from 
within the easement area and clean up and remove any rocks, dirt or any other debris that remain 
from the construction work.  When required, the Developer shall obtain a release from the 
property owner stating that the repairs have been made to the satisfaction of the Owner. A copy 
of said release shall be delivered to the City Engineer. 
 
1.19 
RESTORATION OF CONSTRUCTION SITE: 
 
During the progress of the Work, the Developer shall clean up all construction debris, excess 
excavation and construction materials, and shall restore all fences, irrigation structures, ditches, 
culverts, and similar items.  The Developer shall stockpile the excavated trench material so as to 
do the least damage to adjacent grassed areas, or fences, regardless of whether these are on 
private property or public rights of way.  All excavated materials shall be removed from grassed 
and planted areas and these surfaces shall be left in a condition equivalent to their original 
surface and free from all rocks, gravel, boulders, or other foreign materials. 
 
1.20 
DEVELOPER’S RESPONSIBILITY: 
 
The Developer will be responsible to see that the backfilling, consolidation and compaction are 
properly and adequately done.  Settlement of trenches within a period of one (1) year after final 
acceptance of the project, shall be considered incontrovertible evidence of inadequate 
compaction, and the Developer shall be responsible for correcting the condition in accordance 
with the provisions of these Specifications, including the replacement of the surface materials. 
The Developer is responsible to maintain and repair any problems caused by them to adjoining 
properties. 
 
1.21 
KAYSVILLE CITY POWER AND LIGHT UNDERGROUND CONDUIT 
REQUIREMENTS: 
 
The Developer is responsible for installing conduit for road crossings. The properties should be 
marked and radius for corners marked and staked. A representative from Kaysville City Power 
and Light will mark crossing for the Developer. The Developer is required to dig a trench four 
(4) feet deep and stub eight feet (8’) from the back of curb for future tie-in of conduit. The 
Developer will seal both ends of conduit crossing with conduit seal. 
 
Prior to the digging of the trench for the conduit system, the Developer will have curb and gutter 
in with property marks on curb and property stakes in back of properties. The Developer will dig 
a serviceable trench four feet (4’) deep and thirteen feet (13’) from the center of trench to the 
back of curb with road crossing conduit exposed for Kaysville City Power and Light. (Offsets 
may vary depending on type of subdivision.) If trench is not serviceable, Developer is required to 
re-excavate, pump out water, etc. A representative from Kaysville City Power and Light will 
decide what is considered a serviceable trench. Generally, a serviceable trench means that it is 
level, no cave-ins, water, etc. 
 
June 2020  
When trench is serviceable, Kaysville City Power and Light will schedule time to install conduit. 
Kaysville City Power and Light will be the only utility allowed in trench. They will be notified 
prior to any changes or if problems occur. They will approve or disapprove of any changes. 
 
The backfilled trenches should have the center of the pipe or bundles of pipe, to be located 
thirteen feet (13’) back of curb. The dirt to be backfilled must be suitable enough to prevent 
conduit damage. If conditions are not acceptable, sand may be required to shade conduit to 
protect it from damage. Conduit must be adequately shaded before backfilling. Any broken 
conduit pipe found by Kaysville City Power and Light will be dug up by the Developer. 
Kaysville City Power and Light will repair the conduit only and the Developer will be 
responsible to backfill the hole, repair road, and any other necessary tasks to complete the 
project.

1.22 
GENERAL: 
 
This Division defines the requirements for excavation and backfill for structures, construction 
requirements for embankments and fills, and subgrade preparation for pavements and other 
surface improvements. 
 
1.23 
EXCAVATION FOR STRUCTURES: 
 
Where suitable subgrade soils exist structures shall be founded on undisturbed original subsoil.  
All unauthorized excavation below the specified subgrade shall be replaced with concrete, 
monolithic with that of the slab above or with coarse gravel thoroughly compacted into place. 
 
Subgrade soils for structures not suitable for proper support shall be replaced with firm, dense, 
thoroughly compacted and consolidated material free from mud and muck.  Coarse gravel or 
crushed stone may be used for subsoil reinforcement if satisfactory results can be obtained 
thereby.  Such material shall be applied in thin layers, each layer being embedded in the subsoil 
by thorough tamping.  All excess soil shall be removed to compensate for the displacement of 
the gravel or crushed stone and the finished elevation of any subsoil reinforced in this manner 
shall not be above the specified subgrade elevation. 
 
1.24 
BACKFILL AROUND STRUCTURES: 
 
Backfill around structures shall be placed to the lines shown on the drawings, or as directed.  
After completion of foundation footings and walls and other construction below the elevation of 
the final grades, and prior to backfilling, all forms shall be removed and the excavation shall be 
cleaned of all trash and debris.  Material for backfilling shall consist of suitable excavated 
material or imported sand, gravel, or other suitable material, and shall be placed in lifts which 
will allow the densities to be achieved and which in any event shall not exceed eight (8) inches in 
uncompacted thickness.  Each layer shall be compacted by hand or machine tampers or by other 
suitable equipment to a density equal to 96% of maximum dry density as measured by AASHTO 
T-180 (ASTM D1557). 
 
1.25 
CONSTRUCTION OF EMBANKMENTS AND FILLS: 
 
Unsuitable materials, such as roots, vegetation, or other organic material that occur in the 
foundations for embankments and fills shall be removed by clearing, stripping, and/or grubbing.  
Where suitable materials occur after stripping, the foundation shall be scarified to a depth of not 
less than six inches, and the loosened material shall be moistened and compacted as hereinafter 
specified for each layer.  All materials in embankments and fills shall be placed, moistened, and 
compacted as provided in the following paragraphs. 
 
June 2020  
When the embankment or fill exceeds the amount of excavation, sufficient additional material 
shall be obtained from borrow pits provided by the Developer.  All material proposed to be 
imported shall be subject to the review and approval of the Engineer or his representative prior to 
starting of hauling operations. 
 
The materials used for embankment and fill construction shall be free from sod, grass, trash, 
clods, rocks larger than eight inches in diameter, and all other material unsuitable for 
construction of compacted fills. 
 
Grading of completed embankments and fills shall bring the surfaces to a smooth, uniform 
condition with final grades being within 0.1 foot of the design grade. 
 
1.26 
COMPACTING EARTH MATERIALS: 
 
The material shall be deposited in horizontal layers having a thickness of not more than ten 
inches prior to being compacted as hereinafter specified; provided that when mechanical 
equipment is used for placing and compacting the material on a sloping foundation, the layers 
may be placed parallel to the foundations.  The distribution of materials shall be such that the 
compacted material will be homogeneous and free from lenses, pockets, or other imperfections. 
 
Prior to and during compaction operations, the material shall have the optimum moisture content 
required for the purpose of compaction, and the moisture content shall be uniform throughout the 
layers, insofar as practicable.  The moisture shall be controlled at two percent plus or minus of 
the optimum moisture as determined by AASHTO T-180 (ASTM D1557).  Moistening of the 
material shall be performed at the site of excavation, but such material shall be supplemented as 
required by sprinkling at the site of construction.  If the moisture content is more than optimum 
for compaction, the compaction operations shall be delayed until such time as the material has 
dried to the optimum moisture content.  When the material has been conditioned as hereinbefore 
specified, the backfill or embankment shall be compacted as follows: 
 
(a) 
All trenches in the City Right of Way (under roadways and extending one foot 
beyond the proposed back of walk and under sidewalks and drive approaches to at 
least one foot each side of the edge of the slab), the fill or embankment material 
shall be compacted to a density equal to not less than 96% of maximum dry 
density as measured by AASHTO T-180 (ASTM D1557). 
 
(b) 
Other fills and embankments not listed above shall be compacted to a density 
equal to not less than 90% of maximum dry density, as measured by AASHTO T-
180 (ASTM D1557).

time shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer. The maximum 
allowable infiltration shall not exceed one-hundred-fifty (150) gallons per inch 
diameter per mile per twenty-four (24) hours for all installed pipe. If the quantity 
of infiltration is in excess of the maximum allowable, the leaking joints shall be 
repaired to the satisfaction of the City Engineer at the expense of the Developer. 
 
C. 
Exfiltration Test: 
 
The Developer shall furnish labor, equipment, and materials, including pumps, 
and shall assist the City Engineer in making exfiltration tests of the completed 
line before it can be placed into service. The length of line to be tested at one time 
June 2020  
shall be limited to the length between adjacent manholes. The maximum 
allowable exfiltration shall not exceed one-hundred-fifty (150) gallons per inch 
diameter per mile per 24 hours for all installed pipe. The end of the line which 
projects into the manhole shall be plugged. The pipe shall then be filled with 
water from the upper manhole, and the line maintained under a light pressure of 
four feet (4’) of head. The inflow of water necessary to maintain this head shall be 
recorded as the leakage of the system. If the quantity of exfiltration is in excess of 
the maximum allowable, the leaking joints shall be repaired to the satisfaction of 
the City Engineer at the expense of the Developer. 
 
D. 
Air Testing: 
 
The Developer or their representative (a qualified firm or individual agreed upon 
by the City Engineer and the Developer) shall furnish labor, equipment, and 
materials, including pumps and compressors, and shall perform, in the presence of 
the City Engineer, air tests of the completed pipe before it can be placed in 
service. Each section of sanitary sewer pipeline between manholes shall be tested 
after all the four-inch (4”) service laterals (and plugs) have been installed. Each 
test section shall be pressurized to 4.0 psi. For the purpose of stabilizing the air 
pressure in each test section, the 4.0 psi pressure shall be maintained for a two-
minute period. Each test section shall then be re-pressurized to 4.0 psi for a period 
of four (4) minutes. The test section shall be accepted if, after four (4) minutes, 
the pressure gauge indicates 3.5 psi or greater. Failure of the Developer’s testing 
equipment to properly function shall render the test unacceptable. All faulty 
sections of pipeline shall be repaired and retested until the minimum air testing 
requirements have been met.

Where water is encountered in the trench, it shall be removed during pipe laying 
operations and the trench so maintained until the ends of the pipe are sealed.  See 
"Control of Groundwater" in Division 2 Trench - Excavation and Backfill. 
 
C. 
Laying of Pipe:   
 
The pipe and pipe coating (where applicable) shall be inspected for defects before 
installation.  Any defects shall be repaired or the pipe shall be replaced, whichever is 
deemed necessary by the City Engineer or Representative. 
 
All pipes shall be laid and maintained to the required lines and grades with fittings and 
valves at the required locations.  The pipes shall be installed with 48 inches to the top of 
the pipe minimum cover from finished road surface for culinary water. The Developer 
shall be responsible to install the pipe line to the alignment set by the City Engineer or 
Representative or as shown on the Drawings. 
 
All pipes, fittings and valves shall be carefully lowered from the truck when unloading or 
when installing into the trench.  This should be done one piece at a time in order to 
prevent damage to pipe materials and protective coatings and linings.  Under no 
circumstances shall materials be dropped or dumped from the truck or into the trench. 
June 2020  
 
The Developer shall take the necessary precautions such that foreign materials do not 
enter into the pipe. No debris, tools, or other materials shall be placed in the pipe during 
laying operations.  When laying of pipe is not in progress, the pipe shall be closed by a 
water-tight plug. 
 
Deflections in PVC pipe shall be made by longitudinal bending of the pipe barrel of the 
pipe rather than deflecting the pipe joints. Longitudinal bending shall be limited to eighty 
percent (80%) of that allowed by the manufacturer. This is accomplished by dividing the 
minimum recommended bending radius by 0.8. 
 
All non-conductive drinking water pipes require a tracer wire (12 gauge) for locating 
purposes placed on top of the pipe and connected to the nearest fire hydrant, unless 
otherwise directed. Where splices are to be made, a water tight splice kit must be used. 
The wire should be run from the mainline, to the nearest fire hydrant, and connected to an 
above ground access station (a blue Snakepit RB14-TP, or approved equal). See standard 
drawings for additional detail. 
 
D. 
Pipe Bedding: 
 
All pipes shall be protected from lateral displacement and possible damage resulting from 
impact or unbalanced loading during backfilling operations by being adequately bedded. 
 
In the event trench materials are not, in the judgment of the City Engineer or 
Representative, satisfactory for pipe bedding, imported granular bedding will be required.  
See Division 2a of these specifications. 
 
E. 
Thrust Blocking: 
 
Thrust blocking shall be applied at all tees, valves, plugs, caps and at bends deflecting 11 
1/4 degrees or more.  The fitting shall be encased in a 12 mil protective plastic wrap 
before the thrust block is poured.  Reaction blocking shall be concrete, having a 
compressive strength of not less than 3000 pounds per square inch at 28 days.  Blocking 
shall be placed between undisturbed soil and the fitting to be anchored.  The area of 
bearing on the pipe and on the ground shall be as shown in the Drawings. Restraint sizing 
is based upon a maximum operating pressure of 150 psi and a test pressure of 200 psi, 
and a minimum soil bearing stress of 2,000 psf. 
 
The blocking shall be so placed that the pipe and the fittings will be accessible for repair. 
Prior to backfilling around thrust block, secure inspection of installation by City Engineer 
or Representative. Concrete must be allowed to cure in thrust restraints for 5 days prior to 
pressurizing water lines or have additional approved thrust restraints installed prior to 
pressurizing the water line. 
 
F. 
Connections to Existing Water Lines: 
 
June 2020  
Information on the drawings regarding existing water lines is taken from "record" 
drawings from the city or utility company files and may or may not be accurate as to size, 
type of material or location.  The Developer will be responsible to determine the proper 
fittings and materials required, obtain the City Engineer's approval of the planned 
connection, and perform the construction in a suitable fashion. 
 
G. 
Magnetic Locator Tape: 
 
All pipe shall include a three inch (3”) magnetic locator tape installed in the pipeline 
trench approximately twenty four inches (24”) above the top of pipe. This tape shall be 
prepared for culinary water with white or black printing on a blue field having the words: 
POTABLE WATER. 
 
This tape shall be prepared for secondary water with white or black printing on a purple 
field, color Panatone 512C, having the words: CAUTION:  NONPOTABLE WATER - 
DO NOT DRINK. 
 
3a.41 FLUSHING AND TESTING: 
 
K. 
Pressure Test: 
 
A leakage test shall be conducted concurrently with the pressure test. After the pipe has 
been laid, all newly laid pipe or any valved section thereof shall be subjected to a 
hydrostatic pressure of at least 1.5 times the working pressure at the point of testing. 
 
a. Test Pressure Restrictions: 
Test pressures shall: 
i. 
Not be less than 1.25 times working pressure at the highest point along 
the test section or a minimum of 200psi. 
ii. 
Not exceed pipe or thrust restraint design pressures. 
iii. 
Be of at least 2-hour duration. 
iv. 
Not vary by more than plus or minus five (± 5) psi for the duration of the 
test. 
v. 
Not exceed twice the rated pressure of the valves or hydrants when the 
pressure boundary of the test section includes closed gate valves or 
hydrants. 
vi. 
Not exceed the rated pressure of the valves when the test boundary of 
the test section includes closed, resilient-seated gate valves or butterfly 
valves. 
 
b. Pressurization: 
Each valved section of pipe shall be slowly filled with water and the specified test 
pressure, based on the elevation of the lowest point of the line or section under test 
and corrected to the elevation of the test gage, shall be applied by means of a pump 
connected to the pipe in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer. 
 
June 2020  
c. Air Removal: 
Before applying the specified test pressure, air shall be expelled completely from the 
pipe, valves, and hydrants.  If permanent air vents are not located at all high points, 
the Developer shall install corporation cocks at such points so that the air can be 
expelled as the line is filled with water.  After all the air has been expelled, the 
corporation cocks shall be closed and the test pressure applied.  At the conclusion of 
the pressure test, the corporation cocks shall be removed and plugged. 
 
d. Examination: 
All exposed pipe, fittings, valves, hydrants, and joints shall be examined carefully 
during the test.  Any damaged or defective pipe, fittings, valves, or hydrants that are 
discovered following the pressure test shall be repaired or replaced with sound 
materials and the test shall be repeated until it is satisfactory to the Owner. 
 
L. 
Leakage Test: 
 
A leakage test shall be conducted concurrently with the pressure test. 
 
a. Leakage Defined: 
Leakage shall be defined as the quantity of water that must be supplied into the newly 
laid pipe, or any valved section thereof, to maintain pressure within 5 psi of the 
specified test pressure after the air in the pipeline has been expelled and the pipe has 
been filled with water. 
 
b. Allowable Leakage: 
No pipe installation will be accepted if the leakage is greater than that determined by 
the following formula: 
 
           
         L = SD(P)0.5 
           
 
    133,200 
 
in which L is the allowable leakage, in gallons per hour; S is the length of pipeline 
tested in feet; D is the nominal diameter of the pipe, in inches; and P is the average 
test pressure during the leakage test, in pounds per square inch gage. 
 
a) Allowable leakage at various pressures is shown in Table 1. 
 
b) When testing against closed metal-seated valves, an additional leakage per 
closed valve of 0.0078 gal/hr/in. of nominal valve size shall be allowed. 
 
c) When hydrants are in the test section, the test shall be made against the 
closed hydrant.

Disinfection: 
 
After flushing, all culinary water lines shall be disinfected by chlorination. Chlorination 
shall provide a minimum of 25 ppm residual after 24 hours contact in the pipeline. This 
may be expected with an application of 50 ppm, although some conditions may require 
more. Chlorine in the form of a 1% slurry of high-test calcium hypochlorite (HTH, 
Perchloron, Pittchlor, etc. which are 70% available chlorine by weight) shall be fed into 
the pipeline in such a manner as to mix with the water flowing in the pipeline. (A 1% 
slurry – 10,000 ppm – results from mixing one pound of calcium hypochlorite with 8.40 
gallons of water.) 
 
The following table provides information as to the required quantity of slurry to be used 
per 100 feet of pipe to provide a chlorine concentration of 50 ppm:

system. Use of HDPE pipe in pressurized applications is restricted, unless otherwise approved by 
the City Engineer. The minimum size for culinary water mains is 10” SDR 11 IPS (Iron Pipe 
Size).  
 
If approved by the City Engineer, use of HDPE in the culinary distribution system shall only be 
allowed for transmission lines, meaning no service connections or saddles. In addition, the 
standards in this division shall be considered a minimum and the City shall reserve the right to 
make additional requirements to ensure proper safeguarding of the distribution system, as well as 
other infrastructure.  
 
3a.43 MATERIALS: 
 
High density polyethylene pipe shall be manufactured from resins exhibiting a cell classification 
of PE 345434C as defined in ASTM D3350 with an established hydrostatic design basis of 1600 
psi for water at 73° F. HDPE pipe shall conform to ASTM F714. HDPE pipe shall also conform 
in every way to ANSI/AWWA C-906, "AWWA Standard for Polyethylene (PE) Pressure Pipe 
and Fittings, four inch (4”) through 63 inch for Water Distribution." The HDPE pipe shall be

All pipes, fittings and valves shall be carefully lowered from the truck when unloading or 
when installing into the trench.  This should be done one piece at a time in order to 
prevent damage to pipe materials and protective coatings and linings.  Under no 
circumstances shall materials be dropped or dumped from the truck or into the trench. 
 
The Developer shall take the necessary precautions such that foreign materials do not 
enter into the pipe. No debris, tools, or other materials shall be placed in the pipe during 
laying operations.  When laying of pipe is not in progress, the pipe shall be closed by a 
water-tight plug. 
 
Deflections in HDPE pipe shall be limited to eighty percent (80%) of that allowed by the 
manufacturer. This is accomplished by dividing the minimum recommended bending 
radius by 0.8. 
 
All non-conductive pipes require a tracer wire (12 gauge) for locating purposes placed on 
top of pipe and be connected to all valves and fire hydrants. Where splices are to be 
made, a water tight splice kit must be used. The wire should be looped up valve boxes 
and fire hydrants. See Drawings for tracer wire installation.

O. 
Pressure Test: 
 
A leakage test described in ASTM F2164, “Standard Practice for Field Testing of 
Polyethylene (PE) Pressure Piping Systems Using Hydrostatic Pressure”, shall be 
conducted concurrently with the pressure test. 
 
The maximum permissible test pressure is measured at the lowest elevation in the test 
section. The maximum permissible test pressure is the lower of (a) 150% of the system 
design operating pressure provided that all components in the test section are rated for the 
test pressure, or (b) the pressure rating of the lowest pressure rated component in the test 
section. 
 
a. Pressurization: 
Each valved section of pipe shall be slowly filled with water and the specified test 
pressure, based on the elevation of the lowest point of the line or section under test 
and corrected to the elevation of the test gage, shall be applied by means of a pump 
connected to the pipe in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer. The maximum 
test duration is eight (8) hours including time to pressurize, time for initial expansion, 
time at test pressure, and time to depressurize the test section. Damage to the system 
may occur if testing at excessive pressure or for an excessive time period. 
 
b. Air Removal: 
Before applying the specified test pressure, air shall be expelled completely from the 
pipe, valves, and hydrants.  If permanent air vents are not located at all high points, 
the Developer shall install corporation cocks at such points so that the air can be 
expelled as the line is filled with water.  After all the air has been expelled, the 
corporation cocks shall be closed and the test pressure applied.  At the conclusion of 
the pressure test, the corporation cocks shall be removed and plugged. 
 
c. Examination: 
All exposed pipe, fittings, valves, hydrants, and joints shall be examined carefully 
during the test.  Any damaged or defective pipe, fittings, valves, or hydrants that are 
discovered following the pressure test shall be repaired or replaced with sound 
materials and the test shall be repeated until it is satisfactory to the Owner. 
 
P. 
Leakage Test: 
 
June 2020  
A leakage test described in ASTM F2164, “Standard Practice for Field Testing of 
Polyethylene (PE) Pressure Piping Systems Using Hydrostatic Pressure”, shall be 
conducted concurrently with the pressure test. 
 
Gradually pressurize the test section to test pressure, and maintain test pressure for three 
(3) hours. During the initial expansion phase, polyethylene pipe will expand slightly. 
Additional test liquid (typically water) will be required to maintain pressure. Immediately 
after the initial expansion phase, there are two alternatives to determine if there is 
leakage. 
 
1. Reduce test pressure by 10 psi, and stop adding test liquid. If test pressure remains 
steady (within 5% of the target value) for one (1) hour, then no leakage is indicated. 
2. (This alternative is applicable when the test pressure is 150% of the system design 
pressure.) Monitor the amount of make-up water required to maintain test pressure for 
one (1), or two (2), or three (3) hours. If the amount of make-up water needed to 
maintain test pressure does not exceed the amount in the manufacturer’s literature, 
then no leakage is indicated. 
 
Acceptance of Installation: 
Acceptance shall be determined on the basis of allowable leakage.  If any test of pipe laid 
discloses leakage greater than specified, the Developer/Developer shall, at its own 
expense, locate and repair the defective material until the leakage is within the specified 
allowance. All visible leaks are to be repaired regardless of the amount of leakage. 
 
Q. 
Flushing: 
 
All new water systems or extensions to existing systems shall be thoroughly flushed 
before being placed in service. Flushing shall be accomplished through hydrants, or end 
of line blow-off assemblies at a minimum flushing velocity of 2.5-feet per second.

R. 
Disinfection: 
 
After flushing, all culinary water lines shall be disinfected by chlorination. Chlorination 
shall provide a minimum of 25 ppm residual after 24 hours contact in the pipeline. This 
may be expected with an application of 50 ppm, although some conditions may require 
more. Chlorine in the form of a 1% slurry of high-test calcium hypochlorite (HTH, 
Perchloron, Pittchlor, etc. which are 70% available chlorine by weight) shall be fed into 
the pipeline in such a manner as to mix with the water flowing in the pipeline. (A 1% 
slurry – 10,000 ppm – results from mixing one pound of calcium hypochlorite with 8.40 
gallons of water.) 
 
The following table provides information as to the required quantity of slurry to be used 
per 100 feet of pipe to provide a chlorine concentration of 50 ppm:

During the process of chlorinating the pipeline, all valves and other pipeline 
appurtenances shall be operated several times to provide sufficient contact with the 
chlorinating agent.  Following chlorination, the water line shall be drained and 
thoroughly flushed according to Section A above and, if necessary, rechlorinated until a 
satisfactory bacteriological test is obtained. 
 
Disinfection shall conform to the requirements of AWWA C651, latest edition.  Main 
lines must pass bacteria test. Number of samples to be determined by inspector and will 
be based on site of development. If a new main is connected to an existing main, a 
bacteria test must be completed and passed prior to any pressure testing being conducted. 
 
Following chlorination, the water line shall be drained and thoroughly flushed and, if 
necessary, rechlorinated until a satisfactory bacteriological test is obtained. After passing 
a bacterial test, water must be flushed from the pipe and discharged in accordance with 
all local, state and federal water quality requirements.

Manholes and valves shall require a concrete ring/collar around the cast iron ring and cover 
constructed such that the cast iron ring is one fourth inch (1/4") lower than the existing 
pavement. On newly asphalted or overlayed streets, the cast in place concrete collar shall be 
placed one quarter (1/4") lower than the surrounding asphalt. This is to allow for some 
consolidation of the new asphalt due to traffic and other conditions. 
 
The concrete collars shall be 18” from outer manhole ring, and shall be a minimum of 12” in 
thickness. The concrete collars shall be 12” from outer valve ring, and shall be a minimum of 
12” in thickness. If fiber mesh is used in concrete, then City will allow 12” around manholes. 
 
Where manholes are to be raised this is to be accomplished by removing the cover and frame and 
raising the manhole to proper elevation with concrete. Any adjustments over three inches (3”) 
require that the ring and cover be removed and a concrete grade ring be added to the top of the 
cone. Concrete grade rings placed on the cone combined shall be twelve inches (12”) or less in 
height. In the case this is to be exceeded, the cone section shall be removed and a one foot (1’) 
manhole section installed with the cone reinstalled on top of the manhole section. “Whirlygig” 
riser systems, or an approved equal, will be allowed in place of concrete grade rings.

sidewalks, planted areas, sprinklers, ditches, driveways, culverts, fences, decorative features and 
walls.  All improvements shall be reconstructed to equal or better, in all respects, than the 
existing improvements removed. Any work being done in the City right of way shall first require 
an approved excavation permit. There are costs associated with these permits, based on the 
consolidated fee schedule. All work done in the City right of way shall conform with the 
requirements of the excavation permit. 
 
5a.10 FIELD VERIFICATION OF IMPROVEMENTS: 
 
The Developer will be deemed to have carefully examined the site of the work and to have 
acquainted themselves with all conditions relating to the protection and restoration of existing 
improvements.  The Developer shall be responsible to protect or restore existing improvements, 
whether shown on the drawings or not, unless agreed to in writing by the effected property 
owner and approved by the City. 
 
5a.11 REMOVAL OF PAVEMENT, SIDEWALKS, CURBS, ETC.: 
 
Prior to any removal of road surface, the surface shall be cut vertically along the lines forming 
the trench, in such a manner as to not cause damage to adjoining pavement, sidewalk, curb and 
gutter, driveway, etc. For removal of sidewalk, curb and gutter, vertical cuts shall be made in the 
concrete only at the next adjacent joint. The portion to be removed shall then be broken up in a 
manner that will not cause damage to the asphalt or concrete outside the limits of the cuts; 
however, any surface damaged by the Developer or their work shall be replaced at the 
Developer's expense. The Public Works inspector shall determine the extents or limits of 
adjacent damage requiring replacement.  
 
Broken paving materials and debris shall be removed immediately from the site of the work. If 
four (4) feet or less of asphalt is left between the edge of a trench and the lip of the curb (or edge 
of pavement if there is no curb) after removal, then the asphalt shall be removed to the lip of curb 
(or edge of road if there is no curb) to safeguard against differential settlement. 
 
5a.12 MATERIALS: 
 
Materials used for repair or replacement of surface improvements shall be equal to or better than 
the material removed: 
June 2020  
  
A.

parking areas, etc., the asphalt or concrete surface must be restored in accordance with the 
requirements of the excavation permit, including, but not limited to: 
 
A. 
Before Excavation.  All existing asphalt or concrete surfaces shall be saw cut or roto-
milled to a square edge before excavation. 
 
B. 
Temporary Graded Surface.  Until resurfacing can be done in paved areas a temporary 
untreated base course surface shall be placed deep enough to provide a minimum of 
twelve inches (12") below the bottom of the asphalt surface and shall be brought flush 
with the top of the adjacent paved surface. 
 
The untreated base shall be placed in the trench at the time it is backfilled.  Excess 
material shall be removed from the premises immediately.  The temporary untreated base 
course surface will be maintained as needed by the Developer until the asphalt is placed. 
 
C. 
Preparation for Paving.  The area over trenches to be resurfaced shall be graded and 
rolled with a roller weighing not less than 12 tons, until the subgrade is firm and 
unyielding.  Mud or other soft or spongy material shall be removed and the void filled 
with untreated base course and rolled and tamped thoroughly in layers not exceeding 
twelve (12”) inches in thickness.  Sink holes in asphalt shall be cut out, excavated and 
replaced. Asphalt sinking of any kind will be cut out and replaced once the problem has 
been fixed. The edges of trenches which deteriorate or crumble prior to paving shall be 
removed and trimmed neatly before resurfacing.  
 
Before any permanent resurfacing is placed, the Developer shall trim the existing paving 
to clean, straight lines as nearly parallel to the centerline of the trench as practicable.   
 
Following backfill, the existing adjacent asphalt paving shall be cut back a minimum of 
eighteen (18”) additional inches beyond the previous cuts for the excavation so that the 
edges of the new paving will rest on at least six-inches eighteen (18") inches of 
undisturbed soil. 
June 2020  
 
 
D. 
Asphalt Surface.  The bituminous surface shall be restored by standard paving practices 
to a minimum thickness as indicated in Division 5a and on the standard drawings. 
Pavement over 3” shall be placed and rolled in two lifts. The asphalt surface should be 
¼”-½” above the lip of curb and gutter. If the asphalt is more than ½” or less than ¼” 
over the lip of the curb and gutter, an overlay to adjust the grade shall be required, as 
directed by the City Engineer. 
 
Pavement restoration shall include priming of pavement edges with Type MC-70 
bituminous material (tackifier) and placing rolled plant hot mix asphalt material to a level 
of 1/8” to ¼” above the adjacent pavement surfaces. Areas where there is unraveling of 
asphalt will be replaced. 
 
5a.14 CRACK FILLING/SEALING: 
 
When pavement crack repairs are needed, vegetative growth should be removed from cracks, 
edges, and joints. Cracks should be prepared by blowing them out and dry prior to being filled by 
crack sealant. Melting of sealant should be per manufacturer’s guidelines. The pavement crack 
seal should be dry before applying asphalt coatings. 
 
Crack seal material should be per UDOT Standards 02745, Section 2.3 HOT-POUR CRACK 
SEALANT FOR BITUMINOUS CONCRETE or applicable current APWA standard 32.01.17 
PAVEMENT CRACK SEAL. Crack seal shall be done prior to all asphalt coating projects. 
 
5a.15 ASPHALT COATINGS: 
 
Depending on various factors, including, but not limited to the age and condition of adjacent 
asphalt, project scheduling and traffic conditions, asphalt surfacing may require a preventative 
maintenance coating, as determined and specified by the City Engineer. Asphalt coatings consist 
of chip seals with type A chips and a fog coat, type II slurries and seal coats (type specified by 
the City Engineer). All asphalt coatings shall be applied in accordance with applicable APWA 
Utah standards. 
 
5a.16 GRAVEL SURFACE:

parking areas, unpaved driveways, etc., the gravel surface shall be restored and maintained as 
follows: 
 
A. 
The gravel shall be placed deep enough to provide a minimum of six inches of 
material. 
 
B. 
The gravel shall be placed in the trench at the time it is backfilled.  The surface 
shall be maintained by blading, sprinkling, rolling, adding gravel, etc., to maintain 
a safe, uniform surface.  Excess material shall be removed from the premises 
immediately.

5a.17 MISCELLANEOUS IMPROVEMENTS: 
 
It shall be the Developer's responsibility to restore to their original condition all irrigation canals, 
levees, culverts, gates, fences, drainage ditches, and all such improvements which are cut or 
disturbed during construction.  Topsoil in farming areas or along road edges shall be stored 
separate from subsoil during pipe trench excavation.  Topsoil shall be replaced during backfill 
operations as nearly as possible to its original condition, thereby assuring suitable soil for 
reseeding. 
 
5a.18 RESTORATION OF SURFACES: 
 
Unless otherwise directed, all street surfacing, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, or other hard 
surface that must be removed in the performance of the work shall be restored in kind by the 
Developer in accordance with the Specifications contained herein.  Deviation of more than one-
fourth inch (1/4") between old and new work or within new construction shall be corrected.  
Such measurement shall be made from a ten foot (10') minimum length straight edge.  Adjoining 
surfaces between old and new must be flush.  
 
5a.19 CLEANUP: 
 
At the completion of each area of work all equipment, barricades, and similar items shall be 
removed from the area.  All excess material will be removed. Adjacent borrow pits and road 
shoulders disturbed or used for storage of excavating materials will be smoothed and returned to 
its original contour. 
 
5a.20 PAVEMENT MARKINGS: 
 
The Developer shall be responsible for restoration of pavement markings on all roadways.

5a.24 COMPOSITION OF CONCRETE: 
 
A. 
Aggregates maximum size shall be not larger than one-fifth (1/5) of the narrowest 
dimension between forms within which the concrete is to be cast, nor larger than three-
fourths (3/4) of the minimum clear spacing between reinforcing bars or between 
reinforcing bars and forms.  For unreinforced concrete slabs, the maximum size of 
aggregates shall not be larger than one-fourth (1/4) the slab thickness. 
 
B. 
Water shall be added to the mix to produce concrete with the minimum practicable 
slump.  The slump of mechanically vibrated concrete shall not exceed four-inches (4").  
No concrete shall be placed with a slump in excess of five-inches (5"). 
 
C. 
Air-Content for air-entrained concrete shall comply with the following:

The air-entraining agent shall be added as liquid to the mixing water by means of 
mechanical equipment capable of accurate measurement and control. 
 
D. 
Water reducing, set retarding admixtures shall not be used except with previous approval 
from the City Engineer and shall in such a case, conform to the standards of materials set 
forth in the specification. 
  
5a.25 DESIGN OF THE CONCRETE MIX: 
 
The proportions of the aggregates shall be such as to produce a concrete mixture that will work 
readily into the corners and angles of the forms and around reinforcement when consolidated, but 
will not segregate or exude free water during consolidation. 
 
Prior to placement of concrete, the Developer shall furnish the City Engineer or Representative, 
for approval, a statement of the materials and mix proportions (including admixtures, if any) it 
intends to use.  The statement shall include evidence satisfactory to the City Engineer or 
Representative that the materials and proportions will produce concrete conforming to this 
specification.  The materials and proportions so stated shall constitute the "job mix."  After the 
June 2020  
job mix has been reviewed for conformance to specification by the City Engineer, neither the 
source, character or grading of the aggregates nor the type or brand of cement or admixture shall 
be changed without prior notice to the City Engineer.  If such changes are necessary, no concrete 
containing such new or altered materials shall be placed until the City Engineer has approved a 
revised job mix. 
 
5a.26 OBSERVATION AND TESTING: 
 
The City Engineer shall have free entry to the plant and equipment furnishing concrete under the 
contract.  Proper facilities shall be provided for the City Engineer to observe the materials, 
equipment and processes and to obtain samples of the concrete.  All tests and observations will 
be conducted so as not to interfere unnecessarily with manufacture and delivery of the concrete. 
 
5a.27 HANDLING AND MEASUREMENT OF MATERIALS: 
 
Materials shall be stockpiled and batched by methods that will prevent segregation or 
contamination of aggregates and insure accurate proportioning of the ingredients of the mix. 
 
Except as otherwise provided in Division 8, cement and aggregates shall be measures as follows: 
 
Cement shall be measured by weight or in bags of 94 pounds each.  When cement is measured in 
bags, no fraction of a bag shall be used unless weighed. 
 
Aggregates shall be measured by weight.  Mix proportions shall be based on saturated, surface-
dry weights.  The batch weight of each aggregate shall be the required saturated, surface-dry 
weight plus the weight of surface moisture it contains. 
 
Water shall be measured by weight, to an accuracy within one per cent of the total quantity of 
water required for the batch. 
 
Admixtures shall be measured within a limit of accuracy of 3 percent. 
 
5a.28 MIXERS AND MIXING: 
 
Concrete shall be uniform and thoroughly mixed when delivered to the work.  Variations in 
slump of more than 1 inch within a batch will be considered evidence of inadequate mixing and 
shall be corrected by increasing mixing time or other means.  For stationary mixers, the mixing 
time after all cement and aggregates are in the mixer drum shall be not less than 1 1/2 minutes.  
When concrete is mixed in a truck mixer, the number of revolutions of the drum or blades at 
mixing speed shall be not less than 70 or more than 100. 
 
Unless otherwise specified, volumetric batching and continuous mixing at the construction site 
will be permitted if approved by City Engineer.  The batching and mixing equipment shall 
conform to the requirements of ASTM C685 and shall be demonstrated prior to placement of 
concrete, by tests with the job mix, to produce concrete meeting the specified proportioning and 
June 2020  
uniformity requirements.  Concrete made by this method shall be produced, inspected, and 
certified in conformance with Sections 6, 7, 8, 13, and 14 of ASTM C685. 
 
No mixing water in excess of the amount called for by the job mix shall be added to the concrete 
during mixing or hauling or after arrival at the delivery point. 
 
5a.29 FORMS: 
 
Forms shall be of wood, plywood, steel or other approved material and shall be mortar tight.  The 
forms and associated falsework shall be substantial and unyielding and shall be constructed so 
that the finished concrete will conform to the specified dimensions and contours. Form surfaces 
shall be smooth and free from holes, dents, sags or other irregularities.  Forms shall be coated 
with a nonstaining form oil before being set into place. 
 
Metal ties or anchorages within the forms shall be equipped with cones, she-bolts or other 
devices that permit their removal to a depth of at least one inch without injury to the concrete. 
 
All edges that will be exposed to view when the structure is completed shall be chamfered by 
placing molding in the forms, unless finishing with molding tools.  
 
5a.30 PREPARATION OF FORMS AND SUBGRADE: 
 
Prior to placement of concrete the forms and subgrade shall be free of chips, sawdust, debris, 
water, ice, snow, extraneous oil, mortar, or other harmful substances or coatings.  Any oil on the 
reinforcing steel or other surfaces required to be bonded to the concrete shall be removed.  Rock 
surfaces shall be cleaned by air-water cutting, wet sandblasting or wire brush scrubbing, as 
necessary, and shall be wetted immediately prior to placement of concrete.  Earth surfaces shall 
be firm and damp.  Placement of concrete on mud, dried earth or uncompacted fill or frozen 
subgrade will not be permitted. 
 
Unless otherwise specified, when concrete is to be placed over drain fill, the contact surface of 
the drain fill shall be covered with a layer of asphalt-impregnated building paper or polyvinyl 
sheeting prior to placement of the concrete.  Forms for weepholes shall extend through this layer 
into the drain fill. 
 
Items to be embedded in the concrete shall be positioned accurately and anchored firmly. 
 
Weepholes in walls or slabs shall be formed with nonferrous materials. 
 
5a.31 CONVEYING: 
 
Concrete shall be delivered to the site and discharged into the forms within 1.5 hours after the 
introduction of the cement to the aggregates.  In temperatures over 90° F or under conditions 
contributing to quick stiffening of the concrete, the time between the introduction of the cement 
to the aggregates and discharge shall not exceed 60 minutes.  The City Engineer may allow a 
longer time, provided the setting time of the concrete is increased a corresponding amount by the 
June 2020  
addition of an approved set-retarding admixture, in which case, the time increases to 1.5 hours.  
In any case, concrete shall be conveyed from the mixer to the forms as rapidly as practicable by 
methods that will prevent segregation of the aggregates or loss of mortar.  Concrete shall not be 
dropped more than five feet vertically unless suitable equipment is used to prevent segregation. 
 
5a.32 PLACING: 
 
Concrete shall not be placed until the subgrade, forms and steel reinforcement have been 
inspected and approved.  No concrete shall be placed except in the presence of the City Engineer 
or Representative.  The Developer shall give 48-hour notice to the City Engineer or 
Representative each time it intends to place concrete.  Such notice will give the City Engineer or 
Representative adequate time to inspect the subgrade, forms, steel reinforcement and other 
preparations for compliance with the specifications before concrete is delivered for placing. 
 
The concrete shall be deposited as closely as possible to its final position in the forms and shall 
be worked into the corners and angles of the forms and around all reinforcements and embedded 
items in a manner to prevent segregation of aggregates or excessive laitance.  Unless otherwise 
specified, slab concrete shall be placed to design thickness in one continuous layer.  Formed 
concrete shall be placed in horizontal layers not more than 20 inches thick.  Hoppers and chutes, 
pipes or "elephant trunks" shall be used as necessary to prevent splashing of mortar on the forms 
and reinforcing steel above the layers being placed. 
 
Immediately after the concrete is placed in the forms, it shall be consolidated by spading, hand 
tramping or vibration as necessary to insure smooth surfaces and dense concrete.  Each layer 
shall be consolidated to insure monolithic bond with the preceding layer.  If the surface of a layer 
of concrete in place sets to the degree that it will not flow and merge with the succeeding layer 
when spaded or vibrated, the Developer shall discontinue placing concrete and shall make a 
construction joint according to the procedure specified. 
 
If placing is discontinued when an incomplete horizontal layer is in place, the unfinished end of 
the layer shall be formed by a vertical bulkhead. 
 
5a.33 CONSTRUCTION JOINTS: 
 
Construction joints shall be made at the locations shown on the Drawings.  If construction joints 
are needed which are not shown on the Drawings, they shall be placed in locations approved by 
the City Engineer or Representative. 
  
Where a feather edge would be produced at a construction joint, as in the top surface of a sloping 
wall, an inset form shall be used so that the resulting edge thickness on either side of the joint is 
not less than six-inches (6"). 
 
In walls and columns, as each lift is completed, the top surfaces shall be immediately and 
carefully protected from any condition that might adversely affect the hardening of the concrete. 
 
June 2020  
Steel tying and form construction adjacent to concrete in place shall not be started until the 
concrete has cured at least 12 hours.  Before new concrete is deposited on or against concrete 
that has hardened, the forms shall be retightened.  New concrete shall not be placed until the 
hardening concrete has cured at least 12 hours. 
 
Surfaces of construction joints shall be cleaned of all unsatisfactory concrete, laitance, coatings 
or debris by washing and scrubbing with a wire brush or wire broom or by other means approved 
by the City Engineer.  The surfaces shall be kept moist for at least one hour prior to placement of 
the new concrete. 
 
5a.34 EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION JOINTS: 
 
Expansion and contraction joints shall be made only at locations shown on the drawings, but on 
flat work, shall be placed at least every 50 feet. 
 
Exposed concrete edges at expansion and contraction joints shall be carefully tooled or 
chamfered, and the joints shall be free of mortar and concrete.  Joint filler shall be left exposed 
for its full length with clean and true edges.  
 
Preformed expansion joint filler shall be held firmly in the correct position as the concrete is 
placed. 
 
When open joints are specified, they shall be constructed by the insertion and subsequent 
removal of a wooden strip, metal plate or other suitable template in such a manner that the 
corners of the concrete will not be chipped or broken.  The edges of open joints shall be finished 
with an edging tool prior to removal of the joint strips. 
 
5a.35 WATERSTOPS: 
 
Waterstops shall be held firmly in the correct position as the concrete is placed.  Joints in metal 
waterstops shall be soldered, brazed or welded.  Joints in rubber or plastic waterstops shall be 
cemented, welded or vulcanized as recommended by the manufacturer. 
 
5a.36 REMOVAL OF FORMS: 
 
Forms shall not be removed without the approval of the City Engineer or Representative.  Forms 
shall be removed in such a way as to prevent damage to the concrete.  Supports shall be removed 
in a manner that will permit the concrete to take the stresses due to its own weight uniformly and 
gradually. 
 
5a.37 FINISHING FORMED SURFACES: 
 
Immediately after the removal of the forms: 
 
 
A.  All fins and irregular projections shall be removed from exposed surfaces. 
 
June 2020  
B.  On all surfaces, the holes produced by the removal of form ties, cone-bolts, and she-
bolts shall be cleaned, wetted and filled with a dry-pack mortar consisting of one part 
Portland cement, three parts sand that will pass a No. 16 sieve, and water just sufficient to 
produce a consistency such that the filling is at the point of becoming rubbery when the 
material is solidly packed. 
 
5a.38 FINISHING UNFORMED SURFACES: 
 
All exposed surfaces on the concrete shall be accurately screeded to grade and then float 
finished, unless specified otherwise. 
 
Excessive floating or troweling of surfaces while the concrete is soft will not be permitted. 
 
The addition of dry cement or water to the surface of the screeded concrete to expedite finishing 
will not be allowed. 
 
Joints and edges on unformed surfaces that will be exposed to view shall be chamfered or 
finished with molding tools. 
 
5a.39 CURING AND PROTECTION: 
 
Concrete shall be prevented from drying for a curing period of at least 7 days after it is placed.  
Exposed surfaces shall be kept continuously moist for the entire period, or until curing 
compound is applied as specified below.  Moisture shall be maintained by sprinkling, flooding or 
fog spraying or by covering with continuously moistened canvas, cloth mats, straw, sand or other 
approved material.  Wood forms (except plywood) left in place during the curing period shall be 
kept wet.  Formed surfaces shall be thoroughly wetted immediately after forms are removed and 
shall be kept wet until patching and repairs are completed.  Water or covering shall be applied in 
such a way that the concrete surface is not eroded or otherwise damaged. As soon as the concrete 
has hardened sufficiently to prevent damage, the finished surface shall be protected for curing in 
one of the following ways: 
 
 
1. 
Ponding of water on the surface or continuous sprinkling.  
 
2. 
Application of absorptive mats such as three-inches (3") of cured hay, clean straw 
or fabric kept continuously wet. 
 
3. 
Application of two-inches (2") of moist earth or sand uniformly distributed on the 
surface and kept saturated by spraying with water.  
 
4. 
Application of light colored waterproof plastic materials, conforming to 
"Specifications for Waterproof Sheet Materials for Curing Concrete" ASTM 
C171, placed and maintained in contact with the surface of the concrete. 
 
5. 
Application of a curing compound, conforming to "Specifications for Liquid 
Membrane - Forming Compounds for Curing Concrete" ASTM C309.  The 
June 2020  
compound shall be light in color and shall be applied in accordance with the 
manufacturers recommendations immediately after any water sheen, which may 
develop after finishing, has disappeared from the concrete surface. 
 
Curing compound shall not be applied to surfaces requiring bond to subsequently placed 
concrete, such as construction joints, shear plates, reinforcing steel and other embedded items.  If 
the membrane is damaged during the curing period, the damaged area shall be resprayed at the 
rate of application specified above. 
 
5a.40 REMOVAL OR REPAIR: 
 
When concrete is honey combed, damaged or otherwise defective, the Developer shall remove 
and replace the structure or structural member containing the defective concrete or, where 
feasible, correct or repair the defective concrete.  Prior to starting repair work the Developer 
shall obtain the Engineer's approval of its plan for affecting the repair.  The Developer shall 
perform all repair work in the presence of the City Engineer or Representative. 
 
5a.41 CONCRETING IN COLD WEATHER: 
 
Concrete shall not be mixed nor placed when the daily minimum atmospheric temperature is less 
than 40 degrees unless facilities are provided to prevent the concrete from freezing.  The use of 
accelerators or antifreeze compounds will not be allowed. 
 
5a.42 CONCRETING IN HOT WEATHER: 
 
The Developer shall apply effective means to maintain the temperature of the concrete below 90 
degrees during mixing, conveying and placing.

Planning Commission 
Staff Report 
 
Amendment to the Kaysville City Annexation Policy Plan. 
June 11, 2020 
 
Description: 
Kaysville City has recently gone through an Annexation Process.  When so doing, city staff recognized 
some ways in which our policy could be clearer.  The primary way is a requirement in our policy 
document that annexed property be served by all utilities provided by Kaysville City. 
While the City Council may make an exception to this policy at the time of annexation, having this 
requirement in a policy plan will give both staff and any proposed annexation landowner an expectation 
of what it means to be in Kaysville. 
A public hearing is scheduled with the city council on 6/18/20 to further discuss this item and affected 
entities have been mailed notice of that meeting. The planning commission is tasked with making a 
recommendation to the council for their consideration on that date. 
No change is proposed to the map of expansion areas. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
Staff recommends the included amendment to the annexation policy plan be recommended for approval 
to the City Council.

Annexation Policy Plan 
(Existing Document) 
 
Statement of Specific Criteria 
 
The specific criteria that will guide the decision whether or not to grant future annexation 
petitions are: 
 
1. The area to be annexed is compatible with the character of Kaysville City. 
 
2. Municipal services are needed in the area to be annexed. 
 
3. The plan for extension of municipal services into the area to be annexed is acceptable. 
 
4. How the services in the area to be annexed will be financed is acceptable. 
 
5. 
 
boundaries and in the area to be annexed are acceptable. 
 
6. The interests of all affected entities have been considered. 
 
Justification for Excluding Urban Development Within ½ Mile 
 
been excluded from the Kaysville City Expansion Area are within another city or can be better 
served by another city. 
 
Statement Addressing any Comments 
 
In consideration of adding an additional 60 acres of potential expansion areas east of Highway 
89, there were no concerns expressed by affected entities during the allotted comment period. 
 
The Mutton Hollow Improvement District (District) requested that all of Mutton Hollow Road or 
none of it be included in the Area Kaysville City Anticipates Annexing. District correspondence 
highly recommended that the 2005 plan be retained in order to preserve the integrity of the 
District water system and to comply with the long term wishes of most residents in the area to 
align with Kaysville City rather than Layton City. The 2005 plans show that Layton City and 
Kaysville City each anticipate annexing about half of the District and half of the water system. 
The discrepancy was discussed with District representative who states that the Area shown on 
the 2005 Plan was preferred over all other configurations, so it was shown on the Map.

OPENING 
 
The Planning Commission meeting was held on Thursday, May 28, 2020 at 7:00 p.m. via online 
Zoom Meeting. Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn opened the meeting by welcoming those present.  
 
The minutes of the May 14, 2020 meeting were presented for approval. Steve Lyon made a 
motion to approve the minutes. Quan Nguyen seconded the motion and they were unanimously 
approved.  
 
It was noted at the beginning of the meeting that consideration of final plat for phases 2-4 of the 
Orchard Ridge Subdivision would be tabled to a future meeting at request of the applicant. 
 
PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE REZONE OF 1.47 ACRES OF PROPERTY LOCATED 
AT 1413 WEBB LANE FROM THE R-1-20 (SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL) TO THE 
R-1-14 (SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL) ZONING DISTRICT TO INCLUDE THE 
PRUD OVERLAY ZONE FOR MIKE AND KEESHA HARDIN. 
Lyle Gibson explained that several comments have been made regarding this rezone and 
forwarded to the Planning Commission. Lyle Gibson went on to explain that the subject property 
exists as a single flag lot currently with one home on nearly 1.5 acres of ground. The applicant is 
requesting a rezone to the property to give more flexibility with possible future development.   
 
The difference between the R-1-20 and requested R-1-14 is the minimum lot size allowed where 
the R-1-20 requires lots of at least 20,000 sq. ft. in size and the R-1-14 allows lots to be 14,000 
sq. ft. in size or larger. Both the R-1-20 and R-1-14 have the same allowed uses, same height, 
and same setbacks. R-1 Zoning: (KCC Chapter 17-12) 
 
2 
 
The PRUD overlay zone is being requested in connection with the R-1-14 to allow for flexibility 
in developing the property. The concept provided by the applicant indicates a lot on the far south 
end of the property which would most likely be accommodated as a flag lot subdivision. This 
would make the existing single flag lot into a double flag lot where the access driveway would 
be encompassed by two 18 foot wide flag stems to access the lots. If the zoning moves forward 
and the type of development is desirable the final details of this would be confirmed through the 
subdivision process. Final application of the PRUD overlay zone would take effect only after 
approval of an acceptable final plat.  
 
As a rezone, this decision should be looked at based on its compatibility with the City’s General 
Plan and how well the proposed development allowed by the zoning district fits at the specific 
location.   
 
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn invited the applicant Michael Hardin to speak. Mr. Hardin said 
that he was looking to build a single family home on the lot behind them. Chairperson Wilf 
Sommerkorn asked Lyle Gibson if they allow the rezone to go through can it allow for more 
density to be built there. Lyle Gibson said yes, it could accommodate up to four houses.  
 
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn opened the public hearing.  
 
Cal and Udy asked why Mr. Hardin has not provided a plan showing what he intends to do with 
the lot if rezoned. Lyle Gibson said that under a rezone they do not need to submit a plan for 
development.  
 
Megan Murray, Sam Browning and Jennifer Spjut asked Lyle Gibson how many homes could be 
built on the property if the Hardin’s were to demolish the house and sale the entire property. Lyle 
Gibson again said that it could only hold four homes due to the flag lot building code restrictions.  
 
Christy Barton is concerned about extra traffic on Webb Lane. She wants a development 
agreement written up that states only one home would be built on the additional lot. Mrs. Barton 
asked Lyle Gibson if there was a way they could create the flag lot and have it remain in the R-1-
20 zone-scratching the entire rezone. She would like to make sure that the 20 square feet needed 
to remain in the current zone isn’t there with a survey 
 
Jared Carter was concerned because his property butts right up to Mr. Hardin’s. He asked the 
Planning Commission how a home could be built on the lot with the current stream easement. He 
told the commission that the stream floods every spring and wanted to make them aware.  
 
Megan Murray also wanted to have a development agreement written up stating that they would 
only build one house on the lot.  
 
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn closed the public hearing.  
 
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn said he would like to see more detail and an official survey 
showing the lots dimensions because perhaps this flag lot could be done in an R-1-20 zone.  
 
3 
 
Quan Nyguen asked if they could set limitations on this lot limiting it to only one single family 
house. Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn said that could be something they could do.  
 
Jared Doxey said he would also like to have the measurements verified to see if this could be 
done in the R-1-20 zone. He said it was better to measure twice and cut once.  
 
Scott Hess made a motion to forward a favorable recommendation to the Kaysville City Council 
the rezone of 1.47 acres of property located at 1413 Webb Lane from the R-1-20 (Single Family 
Residential) to the R-1-14 (Single Family Residential) zoning district to include the PRUD 
overlay zone for Mike and Keesha Hardin. Josh Sundloff seconded the motion. The voting was 
as follows:  
 
Scott Hess: Aye 
 
Steve Lyon: Aye 
 
Toby Barrus: Aye 
 
Quan Nyguen: Nay 
 
Vice Chairperson Josh Sundloff: Aye 
 
Jared Doxey: Nay 
 
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn: Nay 
 
The motion passes with four Aye’s to three Nay’s.  
 
PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE REZONE OF APPROXIMATELY 10 ACRES OF 
PROPERTY LOCATED AT APPROXIMATELY 1700 SOUTH 550 WEST, FROM THE 
R-A (RESIDENTIAL AGRICULTURE) AND A-5 (HEAVY AGRICULTURE) ZONES 
TO THE R-1-6 (SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL) ZONING DISTRICT FOR IVORY 
HOMES. 
Lyle Gibson explained that Ivory Homes is interested in a rezone at the subject property to 
establish a level of confidence for future development such as the concept included with this 
report.   
Roughly 3 acres of the subject property is currently zoned A-5, where the remainder is located in 
the R-A zoning district. The existing zoning would allow for development of 2 units per acre 
with some agricultural rights in the R-A zone while the property zoned A-5 could not be further 
subdivided.  
The requested zoning would allow for single family development with lots as small as 6,000 sq. 
ft. in size. The concept provided by the applicant would ultimately require the approval of the 
PRUD overlay zone as well in order to create a common open space subdivision on private 
streets that would also allow for some flexibility in the final lot size.   
Kaysville City has for several years indicated to those interested in developing this area that 
additional access would be needed into and out of the area before development occurs. The 
applicant is aware of this concern, but with the anticipation of the West Davis Corridor and the 
4 
 
extension of Angel Street in the near future, they hoped to establish the base zone now and 
expect to come back at a later date once the access is resolved to work through the specific 
details of the development through the subdivision process and PRUD overlay zone if they 
receive the green light with the current request.  
For now the Planning Commission is considering only the R-1-6 zoning district which is 
regulated through KCC Chapter 17-12.  
As a rezone, this decision should be looked at based on its compatibility with the City’s General 
Plan and how well the proposed development allowed by the zoning district fits at the specific 
location.  
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn invited Ivory Homes Chase Freebairn to talk about this 
development.  
Chase Freebairn said this subdivision would be a few years out for development since there are 
roads that need to be put in before they can develop. Ivory Homes would like to get the zoning in 
place so that they can start on the planning. They would also add an HOA to the subdivision for 
snow removal.  
Jared Doxey said that he is worried about the density of this development and feels that it is too 
extreme.  
Quan Nyguen asked the developer if Ivory Homes would be willing to change the density of the 
subdivision to put in less homes since it is such a drastic change from the surrounding 
subdivisions. Mr. Freebairn said that they would like the commission to vote on the request 
before them and that they have built these types of subdivisions all over Utah and they have 
turned out really well. 
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn said, if they can’t move forward with developing this subdivision 
without the streets being built first why are they trying to rezone this property now. Why don’t 
they wait to make sure that the streets will be developed?  
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn opened the public hearing.  
Russell Lasson said that this rezone seems premature especially with the general plan being 
amended this year. The roads needed should be at least started before a subdivision and rezoning 
are considered.  
Matt Howes was concerned because the current plan shows the only outlet road going onto 
Seabiscuit. He said this was too much traffic to add.  
Matt Hill, Amy Headlee and Megan Fink said this subdivision was way too dense. They were 
worried that the traffic would be too much for the side roads to handle.  
Rose Coleman said that Kaysville City is not ready for a dense development like this. She was 
worried about adding 56 more homes to the already tight sewer system.  
5 
 
Jennifer Ford said that they bought her current house under the impression that this area would 
never be developed due to the sewer land. She also seconded the notion that the increased traffic 
would be a burden on the neighborhood.  
Jason Gagner said that he felt this subdivision would impact home values. It would also increase 
the overcrowding at the local school.  
Tyler Briggs said he was also concerned with the increase in traffic.  
Jon Croasmun, Kim Nuttal, Rose Coleman and Jen Johns said that the subdivision plan was too 
dense and that they were concerned about the increase in traffic as well.  
Justin Humphrey and Brigham Yates said that it was too early to approve this development and 
that the rezone should be denied.  
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn closed the public hearing.  
Jared Doxey said that this area will be developed one day and that he is okay with that however, 
this subdivision plan is too drastic. The density is too high.  
Toby Barrus also agreed that this plan was too dense. He also wants to wait until the roads are 
built.  
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn seconded the idea that this project was too dense. He said that 
higher density does not equate to affordable homes. These homes are smaller but still very 
expensive.  
Vice Chairperson Josh Sundloff said that he would like to wait until the general plan is further 
along.  
Jared Doxey made a motion to recommend denial to the Kaysville City Council the rezone of 
approximately 10 acres of property located at approximately 1700 South 550 West, from the R-A 
(Residential Agriculture) and A-5 (Heavy Agriculture) zones to the R-1-6 (Single Family 
Residential) zoning district for Ivory Homes. Josh Sundloff seconded the motion and it was 
unanimously passed.  
 
PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE REZONE OF 2 ACRES OF PROPERTY LOCATED AT 
711 EAST CRESTWOOD ROAD FROM THE R-1-8 (SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL) 
TO THE A-1 (LIGHT AGRICULTURE) ZONING DISTRICT FOR RUSTIN JESSEN.  
Lyle Gibson said that the subject property is approximately 2.04 acres and Justin has requested to 
rezone from R-1-8 to A-1. The rezone is to allow the owner more ability to use the property for 
agricultural purposes.  
The existing R-1-8 zone is primarily for single family residential lots on 8,000 sq. ft. of property 
or larger. The requested zone still allows for single family residential use, but has more 
6 
 
agricultural allowances and requires a lot of at least 40,000 sq. ft. in size.  
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkorn invited the applicant Rustin Jessen to speak. Mr. Jessen said he 
wants to start producing is own food and perhaps sale the extra produce on his property. He 
would also like to have a rooster for his chickens.   
Scott Hess asked Mr. Jessen if he talked to the neighbors about the rooster. Mr. Jessen said that 
he had spoken with his neighbors and that they were okay with it.  
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkon opened the public hearing.  
Heather Eaton, a neighbor to Mr. Jessen said she was concerned about him up keeping the 
property because in the past he has struggled to upkeep the park strip on his property.  
Chairperson Wilf Sommerkon closed the public hearing.  
Steve Lyon made a motion to forward a favorable recommendation to the Kaysville City Council 
the rezone of 2 acres of property located at 711 East Crestwood Road from the R-1-8 (Single 
Family Residential) to the A-1 (Light Agriculture) zoning district for Rustin Jessen. Quan 
Nyguen seconded the motion and it passed unanimously.  
 
FINAL PLAT FOR PHASE 1B OF THE ORCHARD RIDGE SUBDIVISION LOCATED 
AT 1406 HWY 89 FOR OVATION HOMES AND COMPASS DEVELOPMENT.  
Lyle Gibson said this property which is located at the far north east corner of Kaysville City was 
annexed into Kaysville and received preliminary plat approvals in early 2019. Phase 1 of the 
development has been under construction and the development team is preparing to start 
development of phase 1B and have requested that consideration of phases 2 – 4 be tabled to a 
future date. 
Phase 1B contains 9 lots which all front Orchard Ridge Lane which is to be extended eastward 
until reaching the Weber Basin aqueduct. All curb, gutter, and sidewalk improvements around 
each lot will be completed with this phase and utilities will be stubbed to the south, some of the 
asphalt improvements will come with phase 2 based on coordinating work around the aqueduct 
easement.  
Quan Nyguen made a motion to approve the Final Plat for Phase 1B of the Orchard Ridge 
Subdivision located at 1406 HWY 89 for Ovation Homes and Compass Development. Steve 
Lyon seconded the motion and it passed unanimously.
