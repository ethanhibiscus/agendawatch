Unfinished Business
a. Comprehensive Plan Special Committee Report
Assistant Village Manager Michael Pedersen gave an overview of the status of the
Comprehensive Plan.  On May 4, 2020, he provided the committee members with the additional 
four elements remaining to be incorporated within the plan. Comments for those elements are 
due to him by May 22, 2020. Those comments will be considered to create a second draft of the 
plan, which will then be taken to a second public workshop for public comment. After all 
comments are incorporated and a new draft created, the plan will be sent to the Plan 
Commission. 
Hearing no comments or questions from the Board members, Pedersen concluded the 
report. 
b. Artwork Donation and Outdoor Exhibition
Trustee Symchych stated her concern with this agenda item.  She prefers the public be
allowed to speak to this matter in person. This will be a policy decision and the public should 
have the right to be heard.   
Motion made by Trustee Symchych, seconded by Trustee Fonstad to postpone this 
matter until the public could participate in person so their comments could be heard.   
Discussion ensued. President Frazer stated that the Board has considered this matter 
previously and directed Staff to prepare a written agreement taking into consideration such 
things as engineering, placement of the sculpture, the site to be chosen, etc., which has been 
done.  People can still come to the meeting in person and can participate by Zoom or phone call.  
He felt they had sufficient opportunity to speak to the matter. Trustee Symchych again stated 
the public is not able to weigh in and she does not see the difference in accepting it now or next 
year. Trustee Ollman stated the matter will still have to go to Plan Commission & the Building 
Board, with a public hearing scheduled at a later Village Board meeting. 
Village Attorney Eric Larson stated that every new item subject to the F District zoning 
classification must go through this process.   
Trustee Fonstad questioned the artist’s responsibility as to insurance. President Frazer 
stated that insurance is covered under the agreement.  Attorney Larson stated specifically, Sec. 
6.1 addresses insurance.    
Trustee Sumner stated the matter should be sent on to the other committees, and the 
public could speak at the public hearing. Trustee Symchych stated if it is sent on there is an 
implied understanding about the matter, but she is not sure the Village Board wants this.  
The pending motion was called by President Frazer with a roll call vote to postpone this 
matter until the public could be heard in person:  Trustee Tirado, no, Trustee Kravit, no,

Trust Ollman, no, President Frazer, no, Trustee Symchych, yes, Trustee Sumner, no, 
Trustee Fonstad, yes.  Motion failed. 
President Frazer then introduced the artist, Richard Edelman. Mr. Edelman stated that on 
May 1, 2020 several Village representatives (President Frazer, Assistant Village Manager 
Pedersen and Director of Public Works Brandmeier) visited the subject sculpture, Little Dancer, 
Aged Fourteen, at its current site in the Third Ward and spoke to him from the site. He stated he 
came to Fox Point at the age of 10 and has lived here since then. He spoke to his many projects, 
some of which are in Poland and Israel. He has been recognized for several of his sculptures. 
He loves Fox Point, his studio is here; moreover, his is ideas are conceived and made here, 
sometimes with the help of others for larger projects. He is currently working on projects for the 
Froedtert Brain Center and a memorial piece for the new theatre property in Egg Harbor. The 
subject piece (Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen) has been installed for 10 years in the park in the 
Third Ward. That park is being repurposed for children and the sculpture will need to be 
relocated. The timing is such that he would like to move it out of the Third Ward and into Fox 
Point with one transfer. 
Director of Public Works Scott Brandmeier spoke to the construction of the sculpture, 
stating it is secured with three large slates of lannon stone, approx. 9” thick, with the leg attached 
with 5/8” anchor bolts and seemed sound. Engineering studies would not be needed, as the 
epoxy in the lannon stone is sufficient, there is no corrosion. The gaps between the large lannon 
stone pieces are filled with smaller lannon stone pieces.  No concrete would be needed for the 
structure.   
Trustee Tirado asked where this sculpture would be placed. Mr. Edelman stated there 
that in his view there are two appropriate green spaces on Lake Drive, one at Bradley and one 
at Bell. Both areas can be approached by foot or bicycles, there is north/south auto traffic, and 
a good viewing perspective from all modes. The sculpture is 16’ tall and would look nice in a 
park like area. Edelman stated he had considered other village spaces along Santa Monica Blvd. 
and at Longacre but he thought the sculpture’s size and scale were too big for those sites. 
Motion made by President Frazer, seconded by Trustee Tirado, and carried by roll call 
vote (Trustee Kravit, yes, Trustee Ollman, yes, President Frazer, yes, Trustee Symchych, 
no, Trustee Sumner, yes, Trustee Fonstad, yes, Trustee Tirado, yes),  to refer the Artwork 
Loan and Exhibition Agreement concerning the artwork entitled “Little Dancer, Aged 
Fourteen” offered for donation to the Village by the artist, Richard Edelman, and refer 
same to the Plan Commission and Building Board to consider zoning requirements under 
Section 745-20 B.(2) of the Village Code and Wis. Stats. Section 62.23(5) and make a 
recommendation back to the Village Board.   
President Frazer thanked Mr. Edelman for his presentation, who in turn offered to answer 
any concerns and provide additional information to anyone regarding this matter. 
President Frazer then took up the Consent Agenda items removed for further discussion. 
c. Item 2f was discussed, which was to Approve the State Municipal Agreement for the
Multimodal Local Supplement program funding for Santa Monica Boulevard and authorize
the Village President to sign the agreement per the Director of Public Works’
memorandum dated May 7, 2020.

Mr. Brandmeier gave background as to the grant application made last year concerning the 
funding of a walking trail, either at Stormonth School from School Road to Cardinal Stritch 
entrance at the south end, or on Santa Monica Blvd. Both projects had letters of support. 
This agreement is required to execute a formal agreement prior to the funds being distributed.  
Regardless of this grant, the Village had budgeted for the work and will propose the same 
for the budget next year, as the project will need to be postponed given the timing.   
Motion made by President Frazer, seconded by Trustee Kravit, and carried by roll call 
vote (Trustee Kravit, yes, Trustee Ollman, yes, President Frazer, yes, Trustee Symchych, 
yes, Trustee Sumner, yes, Trustee Tirado, yes, Trustee Fonstad, yes), the Village Board 
approved the State Municipal Agreement for the Multimodal Local Supplement program 
funding for Santa Monica Boulevard and authorize the Village President to sign the 
agreement per the Director of Public Works’ memorandum dated May 7, 2020.  
The Village Manager asked that item 4a. be discussed out of order, as Mr. Justin Fisher 
of Baird was present for that item, and the remaining consent agenda items would require more 
time. Hearing no objection, by unanimous consent item 4 a. was discussed.

New Business
a. Initial Resolution regarding $2,505,000 Village of Fox Point General Obligation
Promissory Notes, Series 2020.
Mr. Justin Fisher of Baird was present. Village Manager Scott Botcher referenced the annual 
borrowing reflected on page 97 of the packet and explained the sale of bonds. The Village is 
conservative with the rates. A balloon payment of $160,000 is due next year, which he suggested 
be included in this borrowing until next year, and the lock in will be at a favorable rate.  Mr. Fisher 
stated that municipalities have seen some volatility recently. Generally, sales tax would affect 
the Village revenue, but the Village is not implementing that. He sees no issue in entering the 
bond market at this time. 
Motion made by President Frazer, seconded by Trustee Ollman, and carried by roll call 
vote (Trustee Kravit, yes, Trustee Ollman, yes, President Frazer, yes, Trustee Symchych, 
yes, Trustee Sumner, yes, Trustee Tirado, yes, Trustee Fonstad, yes), to approve the 
initial Resolution regarding $2,505,000 Village of Fox Point General Obligation 
Promissory Notes, Series 2020, as presented beginning at page 89 of the Agenda Packet. 
President Frazer thanked Mr. Fisher. He then turned to Consent Agenda items 2l and 2n.  
Item 2l:  Approve the proposal of WSO Grading & Excavating, LLC in the amount of 
$11,849 for the replacement of two deteriorated storm drains and associated storm sewer 
piping and road patching in the 7100 block of North Beach Drive and authorize the Village 
Manager to sign the proposal per the Director of Public Works’ memorandum dated May 
7, 2020. 
President Frazer asked Trustee Fonstad to speak to this matter, who gave some background 
relating to the Beach Dr. area. A block down from the south end of Beach Drive., there exists 
three houses served by this road. Work is needed, as the drains are completely plugged in this 
area. This is a section of road the Village maintains and is easy to miss. There was a road at 
one point up the bluff to Green Tree Road, and later a foot path from Beach Drive up to Green

Tree Road. (Currently on the north end of Beach Drive is a foot path (originally a road) up the 
bluff to Fox Lane. This is similar to the old road up the bluff from Beach Drive to Green Tree 
Road which later became a footpath.) Trustee Ollman asked for clarification as to this being a 
public road because a sign exists stating “private driveways, turn around here”. Staff clarified 
that it is a public road. 
Motion made by President Frazer, seconded by Trustee Kravit, and carried by roll call 
vote (Trustee Kravit, yes, Trustee Ollman, yes, President Frazer, yes, Trustee Symchych, 
yes, Trustee Sumner, yes, Trustee Tirado, yes, Trustee Fonstad, yes), to approve the 
proposal of WSO Grading & Excavating, LLC in the amount of $11,849 for the 
replacement of two deteriorated storm drains and associated storm sewer piping and road 
patching in the 7100 block of North Beach Drive and authorize the Village Manager to 
sign the proposal per the Director of Public Works’ memorandum dated May 7, 2020. 
Item 2n:  Accept the quote of WSO Grading & Excavating, LLC in the amount of $65,100 
for the placement of additional temporary protective structures along the shoreline from 
8000 North Beach Drive north to 8040 North Beach Drive pursuant to Resolution No. 2019-
22B and authorize the Village President and Village Clerk/Treasurer to sign the contract 
per the Director of Public Works’ memorandum dated May 7, 2020. 
Mr. Brandmeier then provided the history of this matter. He referenced Fig. 1 in the agenda item, 
stating that the Village Board had approved an emergency resolution for work done along North 
Beach Dr. from the Mary Nohl property to 7540 N Beach Dr.  
An erosion survey was commenced in October 2019. Figures 1-5 reflected the same. The Village 
continued to gather survey data. A storm event occurred from January 10-12, 2020, causing 
what was later declared a disaster for Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha.  President Trump 
approved the declaration of the Wisconsin Emergency Management and FEMA on 3/19/2020.  
Concrete blocks were placed along the shoreline in December 2019. The Village installed 
additional blocks from Beach Ct. to the south.  Then the blocks were double stacked from there 
to the north. Stone revetment was done in concert with the installation of blocks.   
This agenda item refers to the properties from 8000 to 8040 Beach Dr.Trustee. Ollman stated 
the property is identified as 8046 but should be 8040 N Beach Dr.  
The structures that the village has installed are temporary protective structures. He referenced 
Fig. 7, which shows survey work was done on or about October 10, 2019 concerning the private 
property between Beach Drive and the lake. Additional surveying is reflected in Fig. 8, with the 
two black lines representing the Village right-of-way. By way of background: The Village had 
believed it held a fee interest in the properties between the road and the lake. In 1986, there 
were record high lake levels. In 1993-1995, property owners Nicolet, Costello, and a third 
property owner took the real property title question to court, and in 1995 the Wisconsin Court of 
Appeals determined the Village was granted an easement, not a fee interest in the subject 
properties. But the easement allows the Village to go on the properties and engage in activities 
to protect the road (Beach Drive) and related infrastructure.   
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recently indicated the Village could be 
reimbursed for the expenses, but would have to act now. The deadline is July 4, 2020 to firm up 
the total costs and possibly get recovery.

Fig. 8 reflects a yellow line, which is a May 4, 2020 survey. Between February and May 4, the 
shoreline has been reduced by 2’, and is now encroaching on the black line. The concern is for 
loss of the road, and the sanitary sewer main beneath the road.  A lot of land has been lost since 
2018.   
Trustee Ollman asked if the Village is doing work on private property. Mr. Brandmeier replied 
approximately one-half to two-thirds of the work is on private property from the south end 150’ 
to the north end and is similar to the work done on Santa Monica. Trustee Ollman stated concern 
in connection with the work that benefited the private  property owners who own the real property 
east of Beach Dr. Mr. Brandmeier stated that 2 of the 3 property owners have requested the 
Village do the work to protect the infrastructure.   
Attorney Larson, echoing Mr. Brandmeier, clarified that the court stated an easement was 
conveyed, not ownership, from the east side of the roadway to the low water mark of the lake. 
Trustee Ollman argued the Village has an easement, they don’t own it, so like with water laterals, 
why are the property owners along this road not required to sign off on documents, and perhaps 
be assessed for the costs involved?  Discussion ensued. Attorney Larson stated the Village has 
the right to use the easement, but must stay within the boundaries of the easement. Trustee 
Ollman suggested that if the easement goes out only 50’ from the center of the road the Village 
might be in violation. Attorney Larson clarified the easement goes all the way to the low water 
mark of Lake Michigan. 
Trustee Symchych stated that it is anticipated the lake level will rise 5-6” by August. Trustee 
Fonstad agrees it makes sense to do this work, as the shoreline is eroding and endangering the 
road. Trustee Sumner stated a resident contacted her concerning using tax dollars to repair 
essentially private property, and they believe the property owners should do the repairs, not the 
Village. 
President Frazer suggested that the question might be a matter of policy: should the Board 
expect a contribution of funds from the property owners by way of a special assessment.  
Attorney Larson stated that the village might determine it was doing the work not to protect 
private property but to protect the Village infrastructure. President Frazer clarified: if the intent is 
to protect Village infrastructure but the work also benefits a private property owner, can a special 
assessment can be considered. Attorney Larson stated yes. 
Trustee Tirado stated the road is washing out. The map reflecting the south end of Beach Dr. 
when the revetments were put in, slowed the erosion, but did not stop it.  There has been more 
erosion since then.  This may became be a more expansive and expensive project. Mr. 
Brandmeier stated that currently, the amount requested would be covered 75% by FEMA, 12.5% 
by the State, and 12.5% by the Village, resulting in approx. $54,000 of the $60,000.  Trustee 
Tirado is in favor as long as there is reimbursement. There needs to be a long-term fix to the 
problem. 
Mr. Brandmeier stated there is a second grant application framed as coastal resiliency in the 
amount of $2.5m, which includes other professional services, to blend in temporary structures, 
bury in boulders, to provide a gravel layer of 30’-50’ to nourish the beach, provide a better habitat 
and break the waves further out into the lake through a revetment system. The benefit cost 
analysis is rated a 47.  FEMA would look favorably upon this.

Trustee Kravit stated the Village portion of this line item is approximately $6-7,000.  He is in favor 
of the private property owners paying, however, the cost is relatively minor and the work should 
be done.  He moved to approve item 2n.  President Frazer stated the motion was premature and 
suggested that first the Board take up ending debate.   
Trustee Ollman stated he received an email about concern to use public money on private 
property.  He asked the Attorney to provide a clear answer as to scope of the right of way. 
President Frazer stated the attorney already stated the Village had a property interest since 1904 
and then it was classified by the court as an easement, not fee simple. Attorney Larson stated 
that is correct, the Village has the right to use the easement to protect the Village infrastructure.  
Trustee Ollman again stated his concern about the north end of Beach Dr. Trustee Symchych 
suggested the question was answered. Trustee Ollman wanted to know how people were 
notified. Mr. Brandmeier stated 2 of the 3 property owners are in favor of the work being done.  
It is a policy issue to determine if the property owners are to be charged back. 
Discussion ensued as to the lift station to the south.  Mr. Brandmeier stated Miller Eng. provided 
a draft report stating that with the erosion happening, the Village put in additional reventments.  
No costs were discussed.  Trustee Fonstad stated the sole purpose was to protect the roadway, 
which was needed.  Fig. 2 shows the outline of the block, which was intended to be a temporary 
fix. 
Mr. Brandmeier stated the risk is greater if we don’t act now. The lake has been at record high 
levels for 4 months. The Village could lose the road, the sanitary sewer system, and those 
residents could lose access to their homes. He agrees this raises policy issues, but the Village 
does have a valid easement and the opportunity to protect the public right of way. 
Trustee Ollman stated that on page 56 of the agenda packet, a comment is made about a 
disaster declaration. What was that declaration and when was it approved.  Mr. Brandmeier 
stated the declaration can be found at https://www.whitehouse.gov/ 
Trustee Ollman asked if Brandmeier had asked the owners to sign paperwork similar as that 
done for laterals. Attorney Larson again stated the Village has an easement to enter the 
property, so no such paperwork is needed. 
Motion made by Trustee Fonstad, seconded by President Frazer, and carried by roll call 
vote (Trustee Kravit, yes, Trustee Ollman, no, President Frazer, yes, Trustee Symchych,

In conjunction with the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD), the
Village has adopted a Private Property Infiltration and Inflow (PP I/I) policy to fund
rehabilitation activities on private property in an effort to reduce clear water from
entering the sanitary sewer system. Funding for the program from MMSD may
change, but the cost is reflective of the dollars that were originally proposed. It is
estimated that $284,000 may be spent in 2020 to investigate and rehabilitate riser
pipes and associated laterals. Residents will be required to contribute 50% of the
cost of rehabilitation activities in order to maximize the benefit being received from
MMSD.

ORDINANCE NO. ________ 
AN ORDINANCE TO CREATE  
SECTION 19-32 D. ENTITLED “REMOTE MEETINGS” OF THE 
VILLAGE OF FOX POINT VILLAGE CODE 
RELATED TO REMOTE MEETINGS  
OF VILLAGE BOARDS, COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES 
WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the Village of Fox Point in various ways 
beginning in the Spring of 2020; and 
WHEREAS, pursuant to certain emergency proclamations and declarations, the Village of Fox 
Point has allowed meetings of Village governmental bodies to be conducted remotely from time to time 
during the COVID-19 pandemic; and  
WHEREAS, the Village experience with virtual meetings has been largely successful to date, 
with the public having ample opportunity to participate and the governing bodies having ample ability to 
accomplish the affairs of government; and 
WHEREAS, since the Village exercise of emergency powers to allow remote conduct of 
meetings, some of the COVID-19 State and federal orders have expired or have been overturned; and 
WHEREAS, the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic remain, as do the recommended containment 
measures including social distancing guidelines issued by federal, state, and local public health 
officials; and 
WHEREAS, the risks of COVID-19 infection may not apply equally to all people, and not all 
people may be willing to accept the risks of infection that may arise from attendance at in-person 
meetings for the foreseeable future; and also, legitimate reasons for remote attendance at meetings are 
not necessarily limited to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
WHEREAS, allowing the chair of Village of Fox Point Village boards, commissions and 
committees to authorize remote attendance on a case by case basis will allow appropriate balancing of 
applicable issues, including the expected health risks at the time, the risk assessment of particular 
governing body members, the social distancing options available, the ability to obtain a quorum, the 
interest of the public in particular matters, the ability of the public to participate, and any applicable legal 
concerns, and thereby allow the affairs of government to continue in a manner that best protects the 
health, safety and welfare of the Village of Fox Point for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
thereafter. 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Village Board of the Village of Fox Point, Milwaukee County, 
Wisconsin, DOES HEREBY ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

D.
Remote Meetings.  In exceptional circumstances as determined by the chair of the
applicable Village board, commission or committee, meetings may be held remotely
on a case by case basis as described herein. Remote meetings are only authorized
when the chair determines significant health, safety, welfare, family or work
circumstances warrant the remote meeting. Remote meetings are not authorized
merely for convenience, or merely due to vacation, travel, or seasonal relocation of
one or more governing body members. For meetings that include quasi-judicial
action where due process must be provided, the chair must consult the Village
Attorney before authorizing a remote meeting. Remote meeting options are as
follows:
(1) Remote Attendance. When a meeting is held in-person, the chair of the
applicable board, commission or committee may allow any one or more
members of the applicable governing body to attend the meeting by
telephone or other electronic means, subject to the following. A governing
body member seeking to attend remotely shall notify the Village Manager of
this request, and the Village Manager shall notify the chair, and the chair’s
determination shall be final. Governing body members attending remotely
shall have all powers of participation, including being counted in the quorum
and having the opportunity to vote. Such attendance is only permitted if the
technology is sufficient to allow the remote member to hear the proceedings,
and to be heard in the meeting room. If visual information is presented at the
meeting, the technology must allow the remote attendee to view what is
presented or the remote attendee shall be prohibited from voting on the
matter, as determined by the chair. No assurance is provided to any
governing body member who would attempt to attend remotely that the
technology will perform sufficiently to allow for their participation. If the
circumstances leading to one or more governmental body member seeking to
attend remotely are widely shared by others in the general public, the chair
should consider providing a similar remote attendance option for the general
public, that is provided to citizens in a timely manner as part of the meeting
agenda notice.
(2) Virtual Meeting. Upon direction of the chair of a Village board, commission or
committee on a case-by-case basis, such governing body may conduct an
entirely virtual meeting, in which no member of the governing body is present
at Village Hall, subject to the following. Governing body members attending
virtually shall have all powers of participation, including being counted in the
quorum and the opportunity to vote. If visual information is presented at the
meeting, the technology must allow the remote attendees to view what is
presented or the remote attendees shall be prohibited from voting on the
matter, as determined by the chair. In the event of meetings held entirely by
virtual means, the public shall be given access to the virtual meeting platform,
and information about remote access to the meeting shall be provided to
citizens in a timely manner as part of the meeting agenda notice. Best efforts
shall be used to ensure that members of the public lacking access to the
virtual meeting platform are provided alternative reasonable methods to
attend.
