The Town of Summerville Planning Commission Meeting  
Minutes 
May 18, 2020 
 
This meeting of the Town of Summerville Planning Commission was held in Town Council Chambers and was 
attended by Commission Members, Jim Reaves, Chairman; Kevin Carroll; Tom Hart; Jonathan Lee; Charlie 
Stoudenmire; Betty Profit; and Elaine Segelken.  Staff in attendance included Jessi Shuler, AICP, Director of 
Planning; Michael Lisle, Economic Development Coordinator; and Bonnie Miley, Assistant Town Engineer.  
The public was encouraged to view the meeting via the live-stream and submit any comments in advance of the 
meeting through email or by phone. 
 
Jim Reaves, Chairman, called the meeting to order at 4:00 PM.  
 
Approval of Minutes: 
The Chairman asked if there were any edits or additions to the minutes from the meeting on April 20, 2020.  Mr. 
Hart made a motion to approve the minutes as presented, and Mr. Carroll made the second.  The motion passed 
unanimously. 
 
Public Hearings:  
The first public hearing opened at 4:02 PM and was for the petition by The Whitfield Company to annex 
Berkeley County TMS# 208-00-02-013 (approximately 973 acres) located along Interstate 26, Drop Off Drive, 
and Linda Way, currently zoned HI, Heavy Industrial, and Flex1, Agricultural, in Berkeley County and will be 
zoned PUD, Planned Development District, upon annexation into the Town of Summerville’s municipal limits. 
(Council District 2) Mr. Reaves introduced the item and asked if the applicant was present.  Mr. Robby 
Robbins, on behalf of HIC Land, LLC, provided background information on the proposed development.  He 
explained that they basically had to start over with the details of the PUD following the wetlands delineation, 
bringing them to 660 homes, only single-family, no multi-family, 250,000 square feet of light industrial, and 
500,000 square feet of commercial.  Mr. Robbins informed the Commission that they had worked closely with 
the Nexton Del Webb residents even though they are not in Town and added a 50 foot buffer and removed the 
through road adjacent to their development.  He also emphasized that the Economic Impact Analysis showed a 
positive cash flow of over $300,000/year.  Mr. Robbins explained that the last issue to resolve is the Traffic 
Impact Analysis (TIA), which just received a third party review and will be addressed accordingly.  He 
declared that the proposed PUD is compatible with what is currently in the area, and that Council is amending 
the Future Land Use Map in the current Comprehensive Plan to bring it into compliance.  Mr. Reaves then 
asked for any other public comment. 
 
Joel Arenson, a resident of Nexton Del Webb, stated that he and some of his fellow residents provided a letter 
to Ms. Shuler with their comments with three main points that they would like to see addressed. 
 
Ms. Shuler read the letter from the Nexton Del Webb residents into the record, which expressed their gratitude 
to the developer and staff, but requested that additional language be added to the PUD to ensure that a natural 
50 foot buffer be included adjacent to their development; only single-family detached homes be allowed 
adjacent to their development; and that no arterial road would be allowed adjacent to their development.  She 
also displayed four photos of the existing boundary taken by one of the residents using a drone. 
 
Mr. Robbins reiterated that his client had no obligation to work with the Nexton Del Webb residents, but he 
wanted to be a good neighbor.  He stated that the word “undisturbed” was added to the buffer that morning, the 
road is gone, and no apartments are going to be built, just single-family. 
 
Jeff Tibbals, on behalf of the owners of Nexton, expressed his agreement with the staff comments, particularly 
the third party review of the TIA and an additional access for the proposed development.  He stated that his 
clients, as adjacent property owners, were ready to cooperate and discuss an additional access to the proposed 
development.  Mr. Tibbals reiterated the need for traffic concerns to be addressed, as the third party review 
 
 
was received today, and he feels approval would be premature given the need for traffic issues to be addressed; 
however, if it does progress forward, his clients would be amenable to that if the applicant agrees to address all 
recommendations from the third party review prior to final review by Town Council. 
 
Mr. Arenson reiterated his concern about the clauses included in the PUD document, which allow flexibility, 
and stated that he had a detailed markup of the PUD document showing where they would like to see 
additional language, which he provided to Ms. Shuler. 
 
Mr. Stoudenmire asked if police and fire had been considered, and Mr. Robbins responded that the 
Development Agreement included three acres of land for a fire/EMS station after consultation with Chief 
Waring and Chief Rogers. 
 
Hearing no further requests from the public to offer any comments, this public hearing was closed at 4:24 PM. 
 
The second public hearing opened at 4:25 PM and was for a petition by Thomas A. Limehouse and Robert L. 
Arrington to annex Berkeley County TMS# 221-00-00-007 (approximately 2.926 acres) located at 1321 
Beagle Road; currently zoned HI, Heavy Industrial, in Berkeley County and will be zoned G-B, General 
Business, upon annexation into the Town of Summerville’s municipal limits. (Council District 2)  Mr. Reaves 
introduced the request, and Ms. Shuler read an email from the applicants into the record explaining their 
decision not to attend the meeting due to health concerns.  The applicant’s email further explained that these 
properties were surrounded by the Rosemary tracts that were recommended for annexation back in March, and 
their intent was to match that request and not create a donut hole.  Mr. Reaves then asked Ms. Shuler if she had 
received any public comment.  Ms. Shuler responded that she had not received anything. 
 
Hearing no requests from the public to offer any comments, this public hearing was closed at 4:27 PM. 
 
The third public hearing opened at 4:27 PM and was for a petition by JSCA Investments, LLC to annex 
Berkeley County TMS# 221-00-00-006 (approximately 7.36 acres) located on Beagle Road; currently zoned 
HI, Heavy Industrial, in Berkeley County and will be zoned G-B, General Business, upon annexation into the 
Town of Summerville’s municipal limits. (Council District 2)  Mr. Reaves introduced the request, and 
explained that if there were no objections this hearing would be combined with the previous one as the parcels 
are adjacent.  Hearing no objections, this hearing was considered combined with the previous hearing. 
 
The fourth public hearing opened at 4:28 PM and was for a request to rezone TMS#s 154-00-00-073, Miles-
Jamison Road; and 154-06-15-006, 310 Beverly Drive (approximately 306.809 acres), and owned by 
Dorchester County from PUD, Planned Development District, to PL, Public Lands (Council District 6).  Mr. 
Reaves introduced the request and asked if the applicant was present.  Eric Davis with Dorchester County 
Parks and Recreation explained that the site was a little over 300 acres and was originally planned for a park 
and homes, but following the wetland delineation, it was only going to be a park.  Given this change in use, 
they no longer needed the PUD zoning.  He also provided details on the plans for the park. 
 
A resident from Greenhurst II subdivision expressed her concern about the boundaries of the Town and the 
County.  Ms. Shuler used the map exhibit on the screen to explain the areas in the Town, which included the 
entire park property, but not the Coastal Center or the Greenhurst subdivisions. 
 
Hearing no additional requests from the public to offer any comments, this public hearing was closed at 4:39 
PM. 
 
The fifth public hearing opened at 4:40 PM and was for a petition by Knightsville, LLC to annex Dorchester 
County TMS# 144-01-00-005 (approximately1.00 acre) located at 795 Orangeburg Road, currently zoned R-4 
Multi-Family Residential in Dorchester County and will be zoned PUD Planned Development District upon 
annexation into the Town of Summerville’s municipal limits and the existing PUD for the Knightsville Tract 
shall be amended to include this parcel for open space and commercial uses. (Council District 4) Mr. Reaves 
 
 
introduced the request and asked if the applicant was present.  Chris Campeau, representing the owner, 
explained that they were adding this one acre property to the development to clear up entrance issues. 
 
Mr. Charpia questioned if the LLC was the new owner and if this was being done in order to four-lane 
Orangeburg Road.  Ms. Segelken informed him that two years ago the larger development was annexed and 
delineated as a PUD with houses, townhomes, and a commercial area at the front.  She emphasized that this 
had nothing to do with road widening.  Mr. Charpia reported that he used to live in the house with his father, 
and the ownership of the lot was under appeal with his brother and will be going back to court.  Ms. Shuler 
stated that the applicant had submitted a recorded deed showing ownership of the property, which was required 
by the Town, and this deed was displayed on the screen. 
 
Hearing no additional requests from the public to offer any comments, this public hearing was closed at 4:47 
PM. 
 
Old Business 
The first item under Old Business was the petition by The Whitfield Company to annex Berkeley County 
TMS# 208-00-02-013 (approximately 973 acres) located along Interstate 26, Drop Off Drive, and Linda Way, 
currently zoned HI, Heavy Industrial, and Flex1, Agricultural, in Berkeley County and will be zoned PUD, 
Planned Development District, upon annexation into the Town of Summerville’s municipal limits. (Council 
District 2).  Mr. Hart made a motion to recommend approval to Town Council, and Mr. Carroll made the 
second.  Mr. Carroll asked if they were voting on a final document, and Ms. Shuler explained that they could 
amend the motion to include additional changes or send it forward as presented.  She displayed the most recent 
version of the PUD on the screen, which addressed all of the staff comments except the TIA concerns.  Ms. 
Shuler detailed the additional access that was added, although it still fed into Drop Off Drive, and she stated 
that the third party review of the TIA was just finalized that day.  Mr. Hart made a motion to amend his 
previous motion to add that the recommended approval would be subject to the applicant addressing the 
recommendations of the third party TIA review to the satisfaction of the Town’s Engineering staff.  Mr. Lee 
made the second.  Mr. Hart explained his position, stating that the developer has worked with the Town to 
address all other concerns, and he is confident the traffic concerns can be worked out prior to Council 
approval.  Mr. Carroll then asked if the Del Webb requests were adequately addressed, and Mr. Robbins 
described that language had been added that the 50 foot buffer would be undisturbed, the road was gone, and 
no multi-family was included.  Mr. Arenson argued that the PUD still contained flexibility to allow changes 
and the Del Webb residents wanted additional written language.  During the discussion, Ms. Segelken called 
for the question.  Mr. Reaves brought the amendment to a vote, and the amendment passed 6 to 1 with Mr. 
Carroll in opposition.  Mr. Reaves then called for the vote on the amended motion, and it passed 6 to 1 with 
Mr. Carroll in opposition. 
 
New Business: 
The first item under New Business was New Street Names for the Knightsville Tract.  Ms. Shuler stated that 
the Commission had previously approved four names for this same development off of Orangeburg Rd. just 
south of Knightsville Elementary School.  This time, four additional proposed names, Cantona, Cruyff, Weldin 
Gate, and Wolverton, passed review by the County addressing entities, although they were somewhat 
concerned with the spelling of Cruyff.  Ms. Segelken made a motion to approve the four names, and Mr. 
Carroll made the second.  The motion passed unanimously.   
 
 
The second item under New Business was the petition by Thomas A. Limehouse and Robert L. Arrington to 
annex Berkeley County TMS# 221-00-00-007 (approximately 2.926 acres) located at 1321 Beagle Road; 
currently zoned HI, Heavy Industrial, in Berkeley County and will be zoned G-B, General Business, upon 
annexation into the Town of Summerville’s municipal limits. (Council District 2)  Ms. Segelken made a 
motion to recommend approval to Town Council as presented with Mr. Carroll making the second.  Ms. Shuler 
brought the map exhibit up on the screen and explained that this property and the next one on the agenda are 
surrounded by the Rosemary tracts.  Following the discussion, the motion passed unanimously. 
 
 
 
The third item was the petition by JSCA Investments, LLC to annex Berkeley County TMS# 221-00-00-006 
(approximately 7.36 acres) located on Beagle Road; currently zoned HI, Heavy Industrial, in Berkeley County 
and will be zoned G-B, General Business, upon annexation into the Town of Summerville’s municipal limits. 
(Council District 2)  Ms. Segelken made a motion to recommend approval to Town Council with Mr. Carroll 
making the second. Following no discussion, the motion carried. 
 
The fourth item was the request to rezone TMS#s 154-00-00-073, Miles-Jamison Road; and 154-06-15-006, 
310 Beverly Drive (approximately 306.809 acres), and owned by Dorchester County from PUD, Planned 
Development District, to PL, Public Lands (Council District 6).  Mr. Hart made a motion to recommend 
approval to Town Council with Ms. Segelken making the second.  Following no discussion, the motion 
carried. 
 
The fifth was the petition by Knightsville, LLC to annex Dorchester County TMS# 144-01-00-005 
(approximately1.00 acre) located at 795 Orangeburg Road, currently zoned R-4 Multi-Family Residential in 
Dorchester County and will be zoned PUD Planned Development District upon annexation into the Town of 
Summerville’s municipal limits and the existing PUD for the Knightsville Tract shall be amended to include 
this parcel for open space and commercial uses. (Council District 4)  Mr. Hart made a motion to recommend 
approval to Town Council with Mr. Carroll making the second.  Following no discussion, the motion carried. 
 
Miscellaneous: 
The first item under Miscellaneous was the Comprehensive Plan & Master Transportation Plan Update.  Ms. 
Shuler informed the Commission that she would be receiving a complete draft of the plan by Wednesday for 
review by the CPAC and Planning Commission.  Mr. Hart asked when those meetings would be scheduled, and 
Ms. Shuler responded that she would be sending out an email to the CPAC members to find a suitable date the 
second week in June for the virtual meeting, and it would then move forward from there. 
 
Adjourn 
With no further business for the Commission, Mr. Carroll made a motion to adjourn with Mr. Hart making the 
second. The motion carried and the meeting was adjourned at 5:07 PM.

UDO AMENDMENTS 
STAFF REPORT 
PLANNING COMMISSION 
JUNE 15, 2020 
 
 
Description: Amendment of Section 8.3.3.B.3, Preservation During Construction, Barriers 
Required 
 
Reason for request:  The requested amendment was made by Town Council and received first 
reading at their May 14, 2020 meeting.  This change would allow greater flexibility in the materials 
allowed to be used for tree protection barriers, while still giving staff the ability to reject materials that 
would not adequately protect the trees. 
 
Description: Amendment of Section 5.6.9, Alley 
 
Reason for request:  In applying the UDO, staff noticed that this section was not entirely clear on the 
width required for an alley.  This language is being added to clarify the width for either a one-way or 
two-way alley. 
 
Description: Amendment of Section 10.2.1.A, Applicability 
 
Reason for request:  No exemption section exists, and no other section appears to be correct for the 
reference, so this language will be deleted. 
 
Description: Amendment of Section 10.4.2.A, Monument Signs 
 
Reason for request:  In applying the UDO, staff has realized that requiring DRB approval for internal 
illumination for all monument signs in the G-B and UC-MX districts where internal illumination is the 
norm, would be an unnecessary delay for an applicant.  This change will remove the requirement. 
 
Description: Amendment of Section 10.7.2.C, Temporary Banners; Maximum Area 
 
Reason for request:  In applying the UDO, staff has come to the realization that a 15 sf sign securely 
placed on a building that may be 20 or more feet from the road is hard to read.  This change will allow 
for a larger temporary sign if the sign is securely fastened to a building. 
 
Description: Amendment of Section 10.8, Signs That Do Not Require A Permit 
 
Reason for request:  The previous sign ordinance included this exact wording to cover wayfinding 
signage and sponsorship signage, such as those that we have a Gahagan Park and the Miracle League 
Field.  This language was inadvertently left out of the UDO, and staff is requesting that it be added 
back in to make that existing signage conforming and allow additional signage on public property of a 
similar nature. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AN ORDINANCE 
TO AMEND THE SUMMERVILLE UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE 
SECTION 8.3.3 PRESERVATION DURING CONSTRUCTION, SUBSECTION (B) 
ENTITLED BARRIERS REQUIRED, NUMBER 3 
WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Town Council of Summerville for the Unified Development 
Ordinance to have flexibility in providing protection for trees during construction of any type of 
structure, 
NOW THEREFORE: 
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Mayor and Council Members of the Town of Summerville, in Council 
assembled that the Unified Development Ordinance Section 8.3.3 Preservation During 
Construction, Subsection (B) entitled Barriers Required, Number 3 be amended as follows: 
3. Protective barriers shall consist of barriers approved by the Planning Department (a 
minimum of 4 feet in height). Protective barriers shall remain in place until development 
activities are complete. The area within the protective barrier shall remain free of all 
building materials, stockpiled soil or other construction debris. Construction traffic, 
storage of vehicles and materials, and grading shall not take place within the protected 
areas of the existing trees. Any violation must be addressed immediately or a stop work 
will be issued.  
 
It is so Ordained this ____ day of _________ 2020.

ROAD NAME CHANGE 
STAFF REPORT 
PLANNING COMMISSION 
JUNE 15, 2020 
 
 
Description: Road name change for the existing section of Parsons Road that will become a cul-
de-sac with the widening and extension of N. Maple Street. 
 
Reason for request:  With the widening of N. Maple Street and the extension of the road through the 
former Woodlands property, this section of the existing Parsons Road will become a cul-de-sac, and it 
cannot share the same name as Parsons Road.  Both in-town and Dorchester County properties are 
affected by this project, and the Dorchester County Planning Commission will also be holding a 
public hearing on the proposed name change at their July meeting.  Town and Dorchester County staff 
are proposing the name of Little Parsons Court for this section of road. 
 
 
 
Street section shown in red is the section to be renamed.  Street section shown in purple will maintain the Parsons Road name.
