In reference to the above-mentioned property, we have reviewed the application prepared by Frank and 
Bridget Watton and offer the following comments for your consideration.  
 
The applicants are requesting zoning relief to construct a 14’ x 24’ shed in the rear yard of a residential lot, in 
place of an existing 10’ x 20’ shed.  The resultant increase in impervious surface coverage would be 
approximately 136 square-feet.  The maximum impervious coverage for a lot in the B-Residential District is 
30% of the total lot area. 
 
The proposed addition would result in an increase of approximately 136 square-feet in impervious surface 
coverage which will increase the impervious coverage from 43.9% to 45.2%, which is greater than the 
allowable amount of 30%. 
 
There are no engineering objections to or environmental impacts associated with the proposed increase in 
impervious surface. 
 
Should you have any questions or need further information regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to 
contact me at this office.
