ITEM FOR DISCUSSION 
BY THE 
BOARD OF PORT COMMISSIONERS 
DATE: 
June 9, 2020 
SUBJECT:  
Annual Lease Report - Month-to-Month, Holdover1 
and One-year Term2 Leases 
Presented by:  
John Nutter, Deputy Executive Director 
On September 9, 2014 Lease Policies were created for the purpose of establishing the 
administrative authority of the Executive Director related to certain leasing matters and 
providing guidance to staff on negotiating tentative lease terms that will be presented to 
the Commission.   
Within these policies is reference to the Commission’s preference for Term Leases over 
Month-to-Month Leases.  More specifically noted within this section: 
1. Preference is to be given to term leases for the benefits of predictability of
occupancy for the Port tenants, stability of lease revenue for the Port, and
clarity as to the present and future ownership status of tenant
improvements on Port property.
2. It is acceptable to enter into month-to-month leases and leases of one
year or less2:
i. When the Port intends to use the subject property for future
planning or other engagements and needs the flexibility.
ii. When the term of a tenant lease is unlikely to be for more than one
year.
3. Depending on the circumstances, staff may need to take either a
firm stance or provide a concession to those tenants in “holdover”
status when negotiating for new term leases.1
4. Port staff will seek Commission review and approval of all Port
tenants whose holdover status is likely to exceed a period of 12
months.
During the first quarter of each calendar year, Port staff will advise the Commission on 
the status of all month-to-month leases and holdover tenancies. 
The 2020 report is attached for Commission’s review and discussion. 
1 A tenant is in “holdover” status when it occupies the leased premises after the expiration of the term of the 
written lease agreement.  Upon entering into holdover status, a tenant’s occupancy status becomes month-to-
month.    
2  Per Resolution No. 20-1216 Delegation of Administrative Authority to the Executive Director, Section 1.C.1.

 ITEM FOR CONSIDERATION 
BY THE  
BOARD OF PORT COMMISSIONERS 
DATE: 
June 9, 2020 
SUBJECT:   
Annual Lease Report: Security Deviations 
Presented by:  
John Nutter, Deputy Executive Director 
RCW & POLICY REQUIREMENTS: 
RCW 53.08.085 sets forth the requirements for rent security for a term lease of more than 
one year as "an amount equal to one-sixth the total rent, but in no case shall such security 
be less than an amount equal to one year's rent or more than an amount equal to three 
years' rent." It also provides discretion to the Port Commission to "waive the rent security 
requirement or lower the amount." 
On September 9, 2014, the Port Commission adopted Lease Policies in which it 
expressed a preference to obtain appropriate lease security in conformance with RCW 
53.08.085, but acknowledged that certain circumstances may exist which justify the 
Commission's exercise of discretion to waive or reduce the statutory lease security 
requirement, including the following:  
1. Duration of a tenant's tenancy with Port of 7 years or more, with consistent and
timely satisfaction of lease payment, bond/security, and insurance obligations.
2. Value of tenant improvements.
3. Security value shortage falls within 20% of the current range (due to CPI and
other rent adjustments).
The Lease Policies also require that during the first quarter of the year Port staff will 
"advise the Commission of the status of (i) all tenancies for which a lease security waiver 
was previously authorized by the Commission; (ii) all tenancies for which lease security 
is or may be deficient."  
BACKGROUND:  
In accordance with the reporting requirements of the Lease Policies, Port Staff compiled 
lists of Port lease security deviations for review and consideration by the Port 
Commission, which categorizes the identified lease security deviations based on the 
recommended scope and recommended acceptability of the identified deviation. Those 
lists are included as an attachment to this IFC.  Also attached is a listing of all month to 
month leases, leases in holdover status, and leases with a term of one year.   
45
ANALYSIS: 
Reviewing Port leases annually provides an opportunity to assess whether a tenant's 
circumstances have changed and whether the security deviation is appropriate. It also 
provides an opportunity for the Commission to consider waiving or reducing the lease 
security requirement.  
Since RCW 53.08.085 provides discretion to the Port Commission to "waive the rent 
security requirement or lower the amount" it is recommended that the Port Commission 
make specific findings in support of the decision to waive or reduce the statutory lease 
security requirements.   
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:  None. 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
Exposure to potential risks of loss due to the identified statutory lease security deviations 
is considered minimal except for the High Tide Seafood's lease.  In this case, the tenant 
has indicated its inability to secure compliant lease security, but has been paying an extra 
$500 per month towards a security deposit ($9,500 so far). 
RECOMMENDED ACTION:   
Based on the foregoing, Port Staff makes the following recommendations for the 
identified lease security deviations:  
Report 
Staff's Recommendation 
Report 
Attached? 
1. Lease Security
Deviations Within
20% and Acceptable
These identified deviations are within 
the Lease Policies guidelines.  
Staff recommends the Port 
Commission exercise its discretion 
pursuant to RCW 53.08.085 to allow a 
reduction in the statutory lease 
security requirement for these leases 
for the reasons described on the list for 
this category. 
As time permits and/or while in 
negotiations for a lease renewal, staff 
will follow-up on lease deviations.  
Yes (11) 
46
 
 
 
Report 
Staff's Recommendation 
Report 
Attached? 
2. Lease Security 
Deviations Within 
20% and Not 
Acceptable 
Staff considers these deviation(s) to be 
unacceptable because they fall outside 
the permissible scope of acceptability in 
the Lease Policies. 
 
Staff does not recommend the Port 
Commission exercise its discretion to 
reduce or waive the lease security 
deviations.   
 
Instead, Staff seeks the Commission's 
acknowledgement of the report related 
to this category of lease security 
deviation.  
No 
There are no 
leases in this 
category to 
report. 
3. Lease Security 
Deviations Exceed 
20% and Acceptable 
The identified deviations are within the 
Lease Policies guidelines because the 
value of tenant improvements and other 
factors identified in the Policies are 
present. 
 
Staff recommends the Port Commission 
exercise its discretion pursuant to RCW 
53.08.085 to allow a reduction in the 
statutory lease security requirement for 
these leases for the reasons described 
on the list for this category. 
No 
There are no 
leases in this 
category to 
report. 
4. Lease Security 
Deviations Exceed 
20% and Not 
Acceptable 
Staff considers the identified 
deviation(s) to be unacceptable for the 
reasons described on the list for this 
category.  
 
Staff does not recommend the Port 
Commission exercise its discretion to 
reduce or waive the lease security 
deviations.  
Instead, Staff seeks the 
Commission's acknowledgement of 
the report related to this category of 
lease security deviation. 
Yes (2) 
47
Report 
Staff's Recommendation 
Report 
Attached? 
5. Lease Security
Deviations Waived
The identified deviations are acceptable 
due to (i) prior Commission action 
waiving or reducing the security 
requirements; and (ii) the circumstances 
upon which the Commission determined 
to waive or reduce the security 
requirements have not changed. 
Yes (49)

ITEM FOR CONSIDERATION  
BY THE 
BOARD OF PORT COMMISSIONERS 
June 9, 2020 
SUBJECT:    
RESOLUTION 20-1223 TO SELL ABANDONED VESSEL 
Presented by: 
John Nutter, Deputy Executive Director 
RCW & POLICY REQUIREMENTS : 
The Port follows the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) statutes in selling vessels that 
have failed to pay outstanding marina charges.  According to the RCW, such vessels 
are deemed to be abandoned and may be sold to recover outstanding charges. 
RCW 53.08 requires a separate Port resolution before sales of such vessels occur. 
Article VIII A. of the Commission Bylaws requires that resolutions be introduced at one 
meeting before they can be considered for adoption at the next meeting.  This provision 
may be superseded by unanimous consent of Commission. 
BACKGROUND:  
In order to facilitate passage of boat sale resolutions, which are identical except for the 
names of the vessels, their owners, and the auction date, staff introduced a draft of boat 
sale resolutions on August 10, 1998.  The Commission approved the form of these 
resolutions (first reading) and directed staff to fill in appropriate vessel, owner and 
auction date information in the final resolutions (second and final reading). 
ANALYSIS: 
The owner of the vessel listed in Resolution No. 20-1223 has failed to adequately 
respond to several notices regarding their delinquency.  An auction will be held to sell 
the vessels. If the sale proceeds fail to reimburse the Port completely, then the accounts 
will be turned over to a collection agency. 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:  
None. 
FISCAL IMPACT: 
The charges accrued by the vessels have already been recognized as revenues in Port 
accounts.  Conducting an auction enables the Port to begin the process of collecting on 
these receivables. 
RECOMMENDED ACTION: 
Adopt Resolution No. 20-1223 and authorize the auction to proceed.

20-1223
A RESOLUTION DIRECTING SALE OF ABANDONED VESSELS. 
WHEREAS, the Commission of the Port of Port Angeles has seized 
the vessels described below for failure to pay Port charges; and 
WHEREAS, the owners of such vessels have failed to make 
satisfactory payment of such charges; and  
WHEREAS, the Port has complied with provisions of Revised Code 
of Washington (RCW) 53.08 and the Port’s Rules and Regulations 
adopted pursuant to such statute in notifying such owners of their 
delinquencies; 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Commission 
directs the following vessels be sold at public auction pursuant to 
procedures provided in RCW 53.08 and the Port’s Rules and Regulations 
pursuant to such statute. 
“WN7529JJ” 
The time and date of this auction will be scheduled in accordance 
with applicable statutes; public notice of these auctions will be made in 
conformity with RCW regulations. 
ADOPTED this 9th day of June, 2020.
