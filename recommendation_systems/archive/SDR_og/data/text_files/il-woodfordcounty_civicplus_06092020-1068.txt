e. Discuss on entering an agreement with Ncourt Services to allow on-line payments in 
County Clerk Office 
With the Courthouse being closed due to Covid-19, it is hard to fill request for marriage 
licenses, death certificates, etc.  The County Clerk has been looking for a way to allow 
citizens to pay on line so the documents can be sent to them.  There would be no fee to the 
County for this.  We would post a link on the website for citizens to use.  Motion by Spence 
to approve agreement with Ncourt Services and move to the full Board, seconded by Nagel.  
Motion passed.   
While the County Clerk has the authority to make these decision on her own, she wants to 
keep the line of communication between her office and the Board open.  The Committee 
feels this is a good thing to be part of the record for transparency and thanks the County 
Clerk for including them.
